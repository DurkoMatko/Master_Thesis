2014-03-01 11:45:06;Who's broken, Chrome or Angular;"You're trying to do DOM manipulation in the post-linking function which won't work. By the time the post-link function runs, the DOM has already been constructed by Angular's compile phase. There's nothing wrong with manipulating the DOM in a directive, that's what they're explicitly for, actually. But to do that, you have to use the compile function instead of the link function. 

compile: function(tElement, tAttrs){
    angular.element(tElement).addClass('class');

return {
   link: //link code goes here
   };
};

Compile always returns an object of the link function and you no longer use the separate link function like in your example (Angular will just ignore it). If you need to access scope in the compile function (say to set a dynamic class based on controller data) you can't do that in compile, so instead you have to use a pre-link function in the returned object. Pre-link has access to scope and runs before the linkage phase, so it effectively works like compile. 

return {
   pre-link: function(scope, element, attrs){
     //you can manipulate DOM here with scope properties
    },
    post-link: function(scope, element, attrs){
    //mostly for attaching event listeners and things like that
    };

[This](http://www.sitepoint.com/practical-guide-angularjs-directives/) blog post helped me wrap my head around it. Sorry for the lack of formatting. I'm on my phone. 

Edit: I shouldn't say you can't manipulate the DOM in the post-link phase. You can, but it's mostly done on events like click and you have to run $apply to make sure that Angular passes the change out to the DOM. 
More likely you. :) Toss a default case into that switch (with a console.warn), or step debug it.I've just cloned your project, an immediate issue seems to be that the result variable is empty when I try to console.log it. 

Asides from that, the method you're employing isn't a particularly ""angular"" approach - it would be nicer to assign these classes to the elements via your markup, rather than in the directive itself.
Insert 4 whitespaces at the front of a line to format like code.

    angular.module('myApp') .directive('myBackground', function () {             
        return { restrict: 'A', link: function (scope, element, attrs) { 
            var result = getComputedStyle(element[0], ':after').content;
            result = result.replace(/""/g,''); //Because Firefox keeps quotes from content 

            switch (result) { 
                case ""phone"" : element.addClass(""bg-small""); 
                     break; 

                case ""tablet"" : element.addClass(""bg-medium""); 
                     break;
                
                case ""small-desktop"" : element.addClass(""bg-small-desktop"");
                     break; 

                case ""large-desktop"" : element.addClass(""bg-large-desktop""); 
                     break;
             }
        } 
    }; });**Solved!**

I found confirmation of my theory, a Chrome bug. Chrome is handling `getComputedStyle()` with considerable difficulty. If your pseudo-element is set to `display:none`, Chrome 33 Stable soils itself.

2014-09-18 20:28:36;[Help] How are you guys handling CSS/LESS when modularizing your code?;"This might sound crazy, but I think **module-specific CSS should not be coupled to the module**. A base framework CSS file (like Bootstrap, Foundation, or your own) should cover all basic styling for every app you build, and then you should write custom CSS (I keep mine in a public/scss/ folder, which I watch and compile with Grunt) for each app, which is kept separately from the Angular code, so that someone doesn't have to understand Angular architecture to work on the stylesheets.

The point here is to keep structural CSS (Bootstrap/Foundation) away from site-specific CSS which often expresses a specific brand or aesthetic style.

There are cases where re-usable components will need specific structural CSS — a calendar, a music player, etc. These should be implemented as **private bower components** that come with a base stylesheet (as minimal as possible, so you can override in your app-specific CSS).

So basically:

1. Most modules shouldn't need specific styling to function. Thus, keep the modules truly portable by not coupling them with CSS at all.

2. Any modules that _do_ need styling to function (usually related to positioning) you should implement as bower components. 

3. Any set-in-stone modules that you want to implement across projects should be turned into bower components anyway.I put a _foo.scss file in each module directory. Unfortunately, there's no good way to put it all together, so we just have a main.scss file that does @import ""foo/foo"" and so forth. The big issue is that if you have generics you're extending (e.g., compass etc) they'd get multiply imported if you had a lot of different sass files. Sass / Less both could use something similar to a linker, where you compile against a library but the libraries are lazy-loaded at runtime. But I digress.

So I end up with a top, application-level css file that contains all the child sass stuff. This helps with code organization more than anything else, because namespacing css isn't particularly easy anyway. Someday, webcomponents and shadow DOM will fix this.I include <link> elements inside my main templates. I then have a build process which inlines my templates and then inlines the CSS inside the template. It means that I occasionally get a flash of unstyled content when  testing but it doesn't happen after everything has been inlined. The build script isn't complicated, it's about 100 lines of JS.

That is how http://explore.plunker.co is built I think you would like atomify. It covers that and it's very simple. Don't use LESS but with SASS I just write it as a separate SCSS file and then include it in the main compile sheet.If you are following the ng-boilerplate style of bundling you LESS files together with your modules, rather than all in one central LESS directory, you can use the grunt plugin [grunt-less-imports](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/grunt-less-imports) to automatically compile all the LESS files.

I discovered this when I had the exact same question as the one you asked.

A bit more information on how it might be implmeneted (specific to ng-boilerplate but should apply to any such scaffolding) can be found [here](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp/issues/158#issuecomment-41672346)

The build system is Grunt, so not necessarily ""really complex"", although I do think the ng-boilerplate gruntfile in particular is not the easiest to get your head around.If this doesn't quite make sense, think of something like Bootstrap's LESS file organize and the Angular adaptation - UI-Boostrap. There's no real association between the two. If you want any part of UI-Bootstrap you have to pull in the whole Boostrap CSS set. (That's just an example, not trying to start a discussion on Bootstrap/ui-bootstrap organization).

2015-05-22 06:33:46;This AngularJS modules/dependencies thing is a lie;"I've known this for so long now, that I've sort of forgotten that it can nail new people in the ass.

The last one registered with the name wins - which means you have to be mindful about how you name things, or prefix/namespace them.

The other issue that can happen, is once something is defined as a dependency somehow in your app - every other module can use it, even if it was not an explicit dependency.

    angular.module('a',['b','c'];
    angular.module('b',[]).factory('bFactory',function(cFactory) { });
    angular.module('c',[]).factory('cFactory',function() { });

When you run your app, module b can access cFactory, even though you never defined it as a module dependency.

However, when writing my unit tests - I'll only do a beforeEach(module('b')) - in which case, the unit test would blow up and fail about not knowing about cFactoryProvider. Helps keep me honest about keeping my module dependencies in check and being mindful about where I'm getting things from, even if when running as an app - that sort of goes out the window.


Well it will be gone soon anyway and we can do this:

    import {hello as hello1} from 'thirdParty1';
    import {hello as hello2} from 'thirdParty2';

and then just use hello1() hello2() without any DI

You can even do this now if you are using angular 1.4, you are transpiling your ES6 code and if each of the modules exports in the common fashion.We just realized this recently as well. As much as the title sounds click baity, I kind of agree. 

The whole module DI concept really leads one to feel like there is a scope provided for all objects but the reality seems that it is more of a global type of situation. My team recently ran into this issue with a couple popular libraries: https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/issues/521

2015-07-21 09:52:38;How do you handle SPA from a UI perspective?;"[deleted]I assume you are talking about having route ""resolve"" taking time and therefore causing the noticable delay. 

You could hook up on route changing/changed events and add some sort of minimally disruptive wait animation if the route change takes longer than about 160ms (what feels like instentaneous change). 

We've taken the road of not disabling input and not using wait animation, but instead adding transitions so we buy ourselves a little more time on resolves. Also we try to put as little as possible in resolves, and instead load data ""async"".

Hope it makes senseThis issue has a few solutions to show a loading bar during ui-router's resolve. This can probably be implemented using ngRouter aswell.

You could really only enforce it if the API calls go through a server you control and you check for a valid license on the backendSince you aren't providing a service, a one time fee for the script is more appropriate.

2.0 is way too bleeding edge atm to be used in production IMHO.hi.
if you choose to go with ng1 > 1.5, consider using ES6/ES2015 - thus, making the code almost ready for a move to ng2.

https://github.com/orizens/angular-es2015-styleguideI get asked this a lot and finally put an AMA up with some thoughts: https://github.com/toddmotto/ama/issues/8

Hope these help! :)I would lean strongly towards angular 2.

If this software needs to be enterprise-grade from the start, or you have more than just a few people working in it, or if the rest of your team isn't keen on using the cutting edge, then for sure you should stick to 1.5.

If none of the above applies, then angular 2 is right now capable of being the core of a large project and you shouldn't feel too wary of it. I've converted an app to 2 already and am pretty satisfied with it. I'd recommend trying it out. It's pretty decent for beta. As long as you have time to keep upgrading it through the release.It depends on your launch timescale and how critical it is if things are delayed due to hiccups.

I've been ""kicking the tires"" of Angular 2 and even though there are still some rough spots and pain points you can see the promise of it. It's forward looking and embracing the future of client-side development rather than sticking with the past. There are plans for server-side rendering, web-workers etc...

Sometimes there are some frustrations not least because the documentation and know-how hasn't been built up yet but given time that will come. I already feel more productive with v2 despite the learning curve and having used v1 for quite a while.

If you have no Angular know-how at all then I think it's a no-brainer - learn Angular 2 ... when did any old-version framework ever outlive the new version? (apart from Python 2 vs 3).";"I get asked this a lot and finally put an AMA up with some thoughts: https://github.com/toddmotto/ama/issues/8

2016-01-24 21:33:33;UI-Router 0.2.16 released;"Stay tuned.  We're excited about the future of UI-Router.  

We've re-architected and rewritten the guts of UI-Router.  The core code has been divorced from angular, and will be moving to a new repository.  

The angular1 platform specific code (an adapter) will continue to live at angular-ui/ui-router.  

We prototyped an angular2 adapter in less than a day!  We hope to release a preview of ui-router-ng2 within a month, and intend for a production release on or before Angular 2's production release.


We're actively working on getting another 1.0.0 alpha out the door for ng1.  In case you missed it, [1.0.0-alpha0](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/1.0.0alpha0) landed on new years day.


With the new UI-Router 1.0 architecture, creating adapters for other platforms (React, anyone?) should be fairly easy.  Long awaited and long overdue.

Try mapping another domain to it in your hosts file or using a public DNS -> localhost mapping like xip.io (127.0.0.1.xip.io) and you might find it just works.

You don't need to do anything special with Angular to use CORS - it already handles things correctly although you will read lots of blog posts and stack overflow replies that say otherwise (possibly about older versions).Like others have mentioned, a proxy server is the solution. If the owner of the service isn't going to enable CORS you need to set up a proxy server of your own that injects those headers in the response. 

You can set one up in node without too much difficulty. Others may know of an even simpler solution. You'll point your app to your proxy server instead of directly at the remote end points. You need to allow CORS on the server: [http://enable-cors.org/server.html](http://enable-cors.org/server.html)This isn't a client side issue, it can only be resolved through the server header configuration.

When profiling with the chrome devtools timeline I get

Version | JS time | Layout time
-------|-------|-----------
[Angular 1](http://plnkr.co/edit/PlN72d?p=preview) | 65 ms | 75 ms
[Angular 2 original](http://plnkr.co/edit/mJyjcH?p=preview) | 210 ms | 60 ms
[Angular 2 trackBy](http://plnkr.co/edit/mJw0dO?p=info) | 27 ms | 45 ms
Just a couple things:

Where have you heard that Angular 2 is Production ready? I'm not sure that's the case.

Also, you mention the most recent version being beta 3, but at the time of your positing the writing it's actually beta 6. In fact, you're using beta 6 in your example. Just simple corrections.

But I am really curious about that production thing. I haven't heard anywhere say that it's seriously ready for production.

edit: Here's the same scheme using RXJS Observables: http://pastebin.com/Vrrj25SN .. I'm not a pro, just working off what they teach you in the tutorials/guides + a simple observables tutorial. I have no means of testing it (crappy comp).Is it just me or should this code really have used the async pipe in combination with an observable that just keeps emitting new values?

That might provide preformance improvementsThis was proven the other day when it was pasted to the FB page the reason it's slower in this case is because the developer coded it wrong.. 

https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/7088I would love to see some commentary on this! Maybe its an Angular 2 problem, or the code could have been written in a more optimized way (for angular 2). 

Also have you tried bench marking each piece to see where the slow down occurs? 

Wonderful work by the way!I have an app currently in use in production that proved to be significantly faster in all ways. When I converted, I had to remove dozens of performance workarounds that were literally required for angular 1 to function with the amount of data I've got. After converting, I require none of the workarounds at all and it's actually still faster.

I suspect you've found a bug potentially, but I wouldn't call this some indication of overall performance loss.What do you think the results would have been had you utilized RxJS vs. setInterval, which I believe is the preferred way to handle these types of periodic events. 

Also, just thinking about the test scenario you propose.  10000 iterations in 50ms with random getting called 3 times, per iteration. That's a shit ton of operations. Honestly, I don't think that either of them are keeping up with that frequently a UI gets updated.  My guess is that Angular 2 is throttling this to keep things more efficient and lower burden on the UI.  

Some JS benchmarks would be helpful as well.  
Yes it is https://auth0.com/blog/2016/01/07/more-benchmarks-virtual-dom-vs-angular-12-vs-mithril-js-vs-the-rest/I am not that surprised.

I was blown away at the improvements.
I guess that VScode has a comparable autocomplete, but the one in WS is awesome. 

What also is fantastic is the auto import! You start writing the name of the object, and WS suggests all exported objects (first the local ones, then the node_modules). If you accept a suggestion it automatically adds an import line at the beginning of the file.

It also minimizes all the imports section to one line.Visual Studio is good in terms of feature, but if you are writing full javascript app (ex: nodejs/angular) using typescript, I found Visual Studio Code doing amazing job. I don't really find myself in need of these extra features the regular VS has and I love how light VSC is.I'm still a Sublime Text user. It requires some manual plugins (not different from VSC), but once setup it can be complete tool.Anyone been using WebStorm 2016.1 for TypeScript development? What has your experience been? New features look pretty nice, though I've not had a chance to play with it myself. Here's a couple of stats: 

VSCode 127Mb installed, project opens in 3seconds, 58 first level menu options

WebStorm 476Mb installed, project opens in 6 seconds, 179 first level menu options

I suppose that WebStorm does a lot more than VSCode, but VSCode seems to do everything that I want it to. I think Microsoft really nailed it when they decided what to have in out-of-the-box and what could be left to extensions. 

Personally, beyond editing the code itself most of my development activities are handled by a gulp file, so as long as my editor is gulp aware that makes it an IDE as far as I'm concerned.

WebStorm, in comparison, is carrying a lot of things that  I just don't need, for example : 'Toggle Temporary Line Breakpoint  Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F8'.

(context: express/angular, there's no way I'd use VSCode for .NET)You said VSC is an editor as opposed to a full-blown IDE like WebStorm; why is that?If you are not using Visual Studio Community 2015, you are doing it wrong. It has full angular and typescript support.

2016-03-27 21:59:52;UI-Router 1.0.0-alpha.1 released.;"This is a huge boost to angular 1.5. This actually makes it almost as sexy as ng2 with good principles now. I love it.# [1.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/compare/1.0.0alpha0...1.0.0-alpha.1) (2016-03-27)

This release checkpoints the continued development of the 1.0 codebase, as we approach final release.  

### Notable additions in this release:

#### Packages

We are now publishing three separate packages using a new publishing architecture:

  - `ui-router-core`  (npm) framework agnostic core
  - `angular-ui-router` (npm and bower) angular 1
  - `ui-router-ng2` (npm; coming soon!) angular 2

The `ui-router-core` package is framework-agnostic.  Both ng1 and ng2 packages share the code in `ui-router-core` and provide viewport adapters to implement the `<ui-view>`.  Third parties could potentially depend on `ui-router-core` to implement ui-router adapter for any other framework.

#### Route to component

We now support routing to angular 1.5+ `.component()`s in two different ways.  We now put the resolved data on `$scope.$resolve` (or `$scope[controllerAs]$resolve`), so you can use [Components as route templates](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component#components-as-route-templates) in the same way as ngRoute.

We also now allow a state's view to be specified using `component: 'MyComponent'` in lieu of a controller+template.  We will map resolve data to the component's `bindings:` by name.

See the [component](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#component) and [bindings](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#bindings) for more information. 

We also support angular 1.3+ `.component()` with Todd Motto's [polyfill](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-component), and even support old school angular 1.2 directives (instead of `bindings: { foo: '<' }`, we will map to `scope: { foo: '=' }`).

#### View hooks (component/controller hooks)

For a long time, we've advocated using the state machine to manage application lifecycle.  However, using callbacks such as `onExit` can be challenging, since the answer to ""can I exit this state?"" often lives in the view.  We've introduced some view-level callbacks that can be used to integrate controller code with the transition pipeline.

The first view hook we've implemented is `uiCanExit()`.  This hook can be used much the same as the component router's `routerCanDeactivate`.  See  the [Ng1Controller docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uicanexit) for more information.  The `uiCanExit` view hook is simply  sugar for [adding a transition onBefore hook](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/blob/1.0.0-alpha.1/src/ng1/viewDirective.ts#L424-L427).

#### Dynamic params

Dynamic parameters (the replacement for `reloadOnSearch`) can be declared in a [params block in a state definition](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1statedeclaration.html#params) like so: `params; { fooParam: { dynamic: true } }`.  When a dynamic parameter changes, it does not cause the state to be reloaded.  A controller/component callback `uiOnParamsChanged` may be used to be notified of parameter changes.

See the [Ng1Controller docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uionparamsupdated) for details on the new callback.

#### Expose internal state object's API

We're now exposing the internal state objects via an undocumented API.  This can be useful for other library authors who need access to things like `.parent` or `.includes`.  This internal API is subject to change (it hasn't changed much so far), so be careful.  The internal api of an arbitrary state can be fetched like so:

    var normalState = $state.get('foo'); 
    var internalStateObject = normalState.$$state();  
    console.log(internalStateObject.parent.name);


### We will maintain a list of [Known BC from 0.2.x to 1.0 final](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2219) to help you upgrade to the 1.0 release.
Finally. We are using 1.5 components and getting the resolve to work was kinda awkward. 

Working on a ~4 month old application with Angular 1.5.x. I would like to upgrade from UI Router 0.2.15 to 1.0.0A but a bit concerned that this is ... well alpha. The app hasn't launched yet so I could do the upgrade without breaking production code but I'm not sure about bringing an alpha release into an app that will see release soon.

Dynamic parameters (the replacement for `reloadOnSearch`) can be declared in a [params block in a state definition](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1statedeclaration.html#params) like so: `params; { fooParam: { dynamic: true } }`.  When a dynamic parameter changes, it does not cause the state to be reloaded.  A controller/component callback `uiOnParamsChanged` may be used to be notified of parameter changes.

See the [Ng1Controller docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uionparamsupdated) for details on the new callback.

#### Expose internal state object's API

We're now exposing the internal state objects via an undocumented API.  This can be useful for other library authors who need access to things like `.parent` or `.includes`.  This internal API is subject to change (it hasn't changed much so far), so be careful.  The internal api of an arbitrary state can be fetched like so:

    var normalState = $state.get('foo'); 
    var internalStateObject = normalState.$$state();  
    console.log(internalStateObject.parent.name);


### We will maintain a list of [Known BC from 0.2.x to 1.0 final](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2219) to help you upgrade to the 1.0 release.

2016-03-27 15:17:45;ui-router update - Added support to routable components (Route a view to a directive using `component`);"That's great news! But how is it done? I read a [post by you](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2627) a few days ago and you had multiple options in mind. Which option did you settle for?So now I should refactor my standalone controllers to components and route to them instead?Here is my personal project (work in progress), that's already using it. New $state component definition is working as expected :)

Besides new component feature in state definition already working, you can check a full component based angular app architecture, based on dumb/smart components, data service communication, etc...any contribution is well received!Just started learning Angular. Somehow ended up using ui-router. Still not clear on features.

is there an ELI5 for Angular noobs?

2016-07-22 13:20:13;How do I wait for a modal dialog using Protractor?;"Hiii, Protractor works with promises you should write :

    it('Test modal dialog', function () {
        browser.get(mainPage);
        element(by.id(""addNewClient"")).click().then(function(){
            browser.wait(element(by.id(""newClientModal"")).isDisplayed, 5000);
        }).then(function(){
            element(by.id(""clientLastName"")).sendKeys('Smith');
        }).then(function(){
            ...
        });  
    });

wait, click, sendkeys are promises trust me you should wait them ;) else you gonna have fake fails.

If you are using a modal try to wait the backdrop ;)I'm not at home right now but when i get back i'll send you my solution. I had the same problem and i used this solution

    this.clickWhenClickable = function(element) {
        return browser.wait(function() {

            console.log('not clickable');
            return false;
        });
      });
    };

2017-01-11 22:40:11;UI-Router 1.0.0-rc.1 released;"### The following list highlights the most notable changes in this release:

- Route-to-component
  - Now supports binding to a *child state component from the parent state's component* through the `ui-view` tag (for handling events from dumb components, etc)
  - Now supports `""&""` callback bindings to functions returned by resolves
- Url Rules subsystem overhauled
  - Now, the most relevant URL is matched, instead of the rule that was registered first https://github.com/ui-router/core/issues/15
- Query parameters no longer encode slashes as `~2F`
  - New param types: `path`, `query`, `hash`
- Hash parameter is cleared out on subsequent transitions (it is no longer an inherited param) 
- Use `{ location: 'replace' }` when a URL redirect occurs.  This eliminates the extra entry in the browser history.
- Create a new `UrlService` (`$urlService` and `$urlServiceProvider`).  This service is a facade which consolidates the most commonly used URL APIs.  The other URL apis still exist, but are marked as deprecated for public use.
- Typescript definitions (`.d.ts`) are now compatible with Typescript 1.8.x
- Implemented `NOWAIT` resolve policy (do not wait for promises; do not unwrap promises)
- `ui-sref`/`-active` 
  - Links update when states are added/removed
  - Params-only srefs work properly (only change params on the current state)
- ui-view
  - States without any views (template or component) get a template of `<ui-view></ui-view>` allowing easier creation of `abstract` states
- Use `$templateRequest` by default to fetch templates
- Lazy Load
  - More flexible lazy loading (lazy load anything: states, components, services -- whatever you need)
  - Imperative lazy loading (can be used to pre-load lazy states)
  - Bugfixes

2017-03-04 23:42:28;Lazy Loading with Webpack and Angular 1.x;"Unfortunately no. Once your app is bootstrapped there's no official support for registering a module with Angular in 1.x. ocLazyLoad works around this by registering all the components, services, etc. with the proper angular providers (e.g, a component with the $compileProvider), then running the config/run blocks of a module. This is very similar to what Angular does in the bootstrap phase. Future compiles and service injections will work as expected. I think it puts some wrappers around the angular window objects as well. 

If you want 1.x support, I'd recommend using ocLazyLoad. Lazy loading was [proposed](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/11015), but never completed for 1.x. Angular 2 has this ability [built in](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/modules/lazy-loading-module.html). I built a large app in Angular 1.x several years ago and had Lazy Loading in it. I don't have the code anymore (it was for a company), but I believe I derived it from [this post](http://ify.io/lazy-loading-in-angularjs/). I was not using Webpack, but it does use RequireJS, which you should be able to get working with Webpack.

Things to note about this way of lazy loading (and Angular2's lazy load, as well) is that they load code into memory and attach the new stuff to the existing app, but there is no way to UN-load those things. So, if you have a large app, it will take up more and more memory as things are lazy loaded.We are using it with out much headache. ";"Unfortunately no.

4 has been in development for ages and I'll be surprised if it's production ready before the end of the year.It really depends on what work you want to do (and what work you think will be available).  If you only know old tools, you risk being put on maintenance rather than more interesting work.  Bear in mind that Bootstrap 3 has been end-of-life since September 2016 ([announcement](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20631)), and the last v3 release was in July 2016 ([release] (https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2016/07/25/bootstrap-3-3-7-released/)).  The world moves on.  Putting in the effort to stay current is something all developers have to come to terms with.Bootstrap 3 and 4 are not that different, so if you know already one of them it's not a big deal to start writing in another one. The only problem for me was that one uses {LESS} (b3) and the second one SASS (b4). 

I make Bootstrap templates and I use B4 for all my new templates. It has flexbox support and some more extras lacking in B3. If you have work lined up using one version or the other, learn the one that you'll be using. If you want to use features only supported by one but not the other, learn the one with the features you want.

Otherwise, start with one then learn the other. There will always be legacy code to support when new versions come out.It depends. Sometimes you should support some legacy project with bootstrap 2. So, you can start learning 3 and compare it with 4 and 2.
And to be in stream you should keep eye on v4 changesDon't call them freelance jobs if you want to land a contract with a company.

2017-08-01 15:56:21;Bootstrap 4 realease?;"I think we'd all love to know. The last I heard was from bardiharborow at https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/23120:
""If you want a timeline, we're looking at closer to 2 weeks than September, but as always, I can't provide any guarantees.""

That was about 2 weeks ago. I'm under the impression that there are a fair amount of cleanup things left to do and that the contributors have limited capacity right now so they'll need a bit of time.

As for using it in Angular 2, assuming you're using the CLI, just download the latest alpha via npm, change ""app.css"" to ""app.scss"" (if you're not using Sass already), and then `@import` the desired Bootstrap scss file from within ""app.scss"".

For components, ng-bootstrap seems to have good BS4 support. I haven't checked on ngx-bootstrap lately but I believe that one might too.No idea at this point. It's taken far far to long now. Obviously no bad feeling towards its creators, they're making it out of passion. But from a business point of view, it's made the whole bootstrap project look like it's on very shakey grounds for the future. I say this as someone who uses it every day and loves it to pieces.

We're at just under 3 years since Bootstrap 4 was announced. In comparison it took 17 months to go from Bootstrap 2's first release to Bootstrap 3's first stable release. We're at 47 months now and still not close to a stable release.

They really need to look at getting more core contributors on board. I get that this is mdo's baby and he's very protective of it. But seriously there's something very wrong when he has to spend an evening randomly closing issues and instantly halting all BS3 development to try and push BS4 out.

""If you want a timeline, we're looking at closer to 2 weeks than September, but as always, I can't provide any guarantees.""

That was about 2 weeks ago. I'm under the impression that there are a fair amount of cleanup things left to do and that the contributors have limited capacity right now so they'll need a bit of time.

As for using it in Angular 2, assuming you're using the CLI, just download the latest alpha via npm, change ""app.css"" to ""app.scss"" (if you're not using Sass already), and then `@import` the desired Bootstrap scss file from within ""app.scss"".

For components, ng-bootstrap seems to have good BS4 support. I haven't checked on ngx-bootstrap lately but I believe that one might too.";bootstrap

You could also just download the added express app repo at the appropriate time, or the built ember files as the appropriate time as needed in your builds. Can you elaborate a bit on which part you are unsure about? It sounds like you have a pretty good grasp for it. 

You can build the ember app out to a specific folder using the output-path flag. ie:
> ember build --output-path=../public/dashboard

Then in your express app for the your /user/dashboard route you can serve the ember app from that directory.

2013-02-03 19:37:37;fs-extra: Drop in replacement for fs. Adds a few extra file system methods.;"Hi, module author here.

I wanted to share this not because it's new or novel. But because I'm interested in getting the community's feedback. Particularly on the section ""Roadmap"". 

This is my most depended upon module (https://npmjs.org/package/fs-extra) so I thought it made sense to solicit feedback from the community to help guide it in the right direction.I dislike these kinds of utility grab bags of functionality.

1. It's difficult to know what is in them so it isn't obvious from the `npm search` results that your particular module has whatever it is that I'm looking for when I go to search.

2. Big packages with lots of methods are much more work because there is much more surface area for bugs. This is another issue of focus.

3. Versioning for downstream dependencies is much harder since it's not always clear which function changed in which particular version and when it's safe to bump the version. You might not even be using the function that caused the major or minor version to increment so to upgrade that package dependency requires a careful upstream analysis of the changes. It's much nicer for packages that depend on your modules when each piece of separable functionality is made separate since the versioning is independent too.

I like it much better when these morsels of functionality like cross-platform `rm -rf` are split out into entirely separate modules with entirely independent documentation and tests. It's much easier to contribute patches to tiny projects with narrow scope than sprawling packages with no clearly defined limits. With tiny modules you also avoid the constant turf wars and bike shedding about which functions belong and which functions don't belong. It's something of a historical mistake that the fs module is as large as it is, as the emphasis in the node community and core developed has turned largely towards highly focused tiny pieces.

Here's a relevant discussion that erupted months ago (edit: and I see is linked to in the fs-extra readme) with one of my modules with some more concrete examples and reasons for preferring small modules to large utility-style ones:
https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/17

And just for fun [hoarders](https://npmjs.org/package/hoarders) is the utility grab bag idea taken to its most comple logical extreme.regarding `createFile`, maybe liken the operation to shell `mkdir -p $basedir && touch $filename` in your docs?

I don't like the naming of `remove` - it's a bit too generous.  Perhaps something a bit more strongly worded, like `purgePath`?  You need to imply that it's a recursive delete, after all, and that it should be used with **utmost caution**.";"I dislike these kinds of utility grab bags of functionality.

2013-04-12 09:29:39;exports vs module.exports in node.js;"exports === module.exports  
typeof exports === 'object'
*Wrong.*

``module.exports`` and ``exports`` *are* the same thing, in the sense that when Node.js starts it creates an object that they both reference, but they are *different* in the sense that they are two separate variables that point to the same value.

If you add properties to the object they both reference, they both can see it, but when you *change the very thing one of them is pointing at*, only that variable can see it.

    ASCII ART EXPLAINING POINTERS IN JAVASCRIPT
     
    On creation, they point at the same object
    
    module.exports --> [object]
                        /
    exports -----------/
    
    Add a property to that object, they both see it.
    
    module.exports.foo = ""bar"";
    
    module.exports --> [object].foo -> ""bar""
                          /
    exports -------------/
    
    Totally reassign that object, they see different values.
    
    exports = SomeClass;
    
    module.exports --> [object].foo -> ""bar""
    
    exports --> SomeClass;
    
    Node.js's *module* system uses whatever is attached to module.
    
    exports is just a shorthand (that perhaps should never have been)

That last solution at the end is bogus, too. The simplest solution is just *forget ``exports`` ever existed, only use ``module.exports``.*you guys are over complicating things. easiest to understand it as a closure.

2013-09-06 23:26:58;Do Not Use bodyParser with Express.js;"For most of my apps, the only data I really ever need from a POST is going to be in json format so the json middleware is enough for me.

But I can't even remember the last time I've seen ANY of the example apps or tutorials that people post on here and in /r/webdev for express use anything other than bodyParser. Random - Even though the guy who maintains express, and many other projects, must be EXTREMELY busy, I once dropped him an e-mail and he responded same day. Back when I e-mailed him I was a bit of a newb and didn't expect a response at all. I know it's a bind of a grand assertion to make... but if someone like that answers an e-mail from some random newb (which was obvious based on my question) I'm gonna go ahead and assume he's a great guy.,I've seen /tmp directories getting out of hand in a variety of environments, this problem is common and isn't confined to Express.  It's a good idea to have some sort of scheduled/active maintenance of /tmp to ensure it doesn't get out of hand.

What are the options here?  At the last place I worked they had a cron job that ran to clean up old files.  Is there not a better way to do this?  Maybe a file system driver for fuse that could do this transparently would be cool - but probably needless complicates things.

Out of interest, what's your solution?  Presumably clean up the temp files properly if a move doesn't take place.  Have you made a merge request?The article author does have a point about TJ being super busy. He has pretty much abandoned Kue. Now that he is working on Koa I wonder if he will stop working on express. I pointed out this aaaages ago on GitHub:

https://github.com/visionmedia/express/issues/1673

And since then, there is a plan in the works to change the default behaviour of the bodyParser:

https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/871

However, as TJ rightly points out, this is a fairly standard way of operating; it's just that it should have been made clearer in the documentation and examples.Very good tot know. This gives me a good excuse to dump bodyParser. I never liked that it parsed the request body prematurely based on the content type of the request. This can cause major headaches when you want to stream data directly to somewhere else. If the bodyparser is enabled and the user sends a json file, the bodyparser will use the request body to parse the json. Once the request had reached an endpoint (app.post) the endpoint cannot get to its data anymore.

The alternatives for multipart also sound much better, since they're streamable. Maybe that should become the standard for express?Is this really a vulnerability? I think it's working as designed.

It looks like he's basically saying the problem is in node formidable, which is a module that handles forms and **file uploads**. The temp files that he's seeing are most likely the uploaded files. Probably why the maintainer hasn't responded.

Edit: File handling is not within the scope of Formidable, its scope is to handle forms and uploads. The maintainer has no clue how you want to handle the files and doesn't care.

Basically it seems like this post is complaining that this module has an open output pipe that's leaking because it's not connected to a kitchen sink when the pipe could also be used for a water fountain.I'm not half as disappointed that there's a vulnerability in there as I am with the amount of people giving TJ nonconstructive feedback/neckbeardrage on Twitter.Its a temp file in a temp directory.  So what if he doesn't delete it?

After ALL of this time has ANYONE else ever actually had a security problem related to that?  No.

Its not a security problem.  If you have a bunch of people uploading files then you may need a cron to delete temp files.  So what.

That's not a security vulnerability or a reason to stop using bodyParser.  If someone floods your server with enough data to eat your entire hard disk then you have a problem regardless of temp files.";"I pointed out this aaaages ago on GitHub:

2013-12-19 03:49:16;There is no way to throttle a websocket in node, correct?;"You could create a processing queue, but if you're receiving more packets than you can handle, eventually the queue is gonna fill up.  Throttling isn't going to solve the problem, because then the packets will just back up in a different place.

I would suggest that you start tracking how many messages you receive per second and start dropping packets once you go over a threshold that you cant process.

If that isn't an option... Get a faster database.

Also, it used to be that twitter firehose had a way of capping the maximum number of messages it would send you per second.  Been a while since I used it tho.Can't you just push all the requests to redis as they come in and then do all the data processing and inserts into the slower databases via a separate background process (or several processes/threads) and also do the database inserts in bulk rather than one by one?You can pause -- or have the websocket server not read -- the low-level stream.First of all keep a persistant connection to the database, this will reduce delays there. Next you can thread the workers to help with any large load. Otherwise i would expect that you would be good.Good question.  I googled it some.  First, I didn't know there was anything such as a Twitter firehose, which apparently is a stream of every single tweet on the planet?  Very interesting technical problem.  Not the least bit trivial.

https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node/issues/15  Towards the end they say they fixed it.

I think this is the related module from further on in dev, and someone talking about another related issue: https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node/issues/3

But if you throttle consuming the websocket, aren't you still going to have a huge backlog to process?  

I think a queue is a good idea.  Also pipelining.  I mean, if your database is not the fastest, maybe try sending a bunch of inserts at a time, rather than one at a time.

Or use a faster database.  Or partition the tweets somehow and use multiple databases.

Or filter your twitter stream more?

My instinct is that it is best to avoid messing with the websocket level and handle it at a higher level because I think the road you are going down is going to have some interesting details but not be an efficient way to solve your problem in terms of developer time or code re-use down the line.

You could also take a look at http://datasift.com/ and http://gnip.com/ which might be a more convenient way to solve your business problem than directly accessing the firehose.

Have you done any testing with a real twitter stream and real database?  How much data is actually being sent down the hose on average? https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/7892  According to this it could be like 400GB of data per day for the full stream.  Or are you talking about spritzer or gardenose?

I think you pretty much have to filter out a lot of the data or aggregate it or shard it somehow.  Seems like too much data to store and keep querying.

What are you doing with the firehose data?

Before saving the data, I would just verify that you could process that amount of data in any way in memory.   I mean, is it even possible for one Node process to distribute that amount of data to a cluster of other servers for processing?   Would it be fast enough to handle the full firehose?

If its the full firehose I think your first problem might be bandwidth and hardware.
";"Good question.  I googled it some.  First, I didn't know there was anything such as a Twitter firehose, which apparently is a stream of every single tweet on the planet?  Very interesting technical problem.  Not the least bit trivial.

https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node/issues/15  Towards the end they say they fixed it.

I think this is the related module from further on in dev, and someone talking about another related issue: https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node/issues/3

But if you throttle consuming the websocket, aren't you still going to have a huge backlog to process?  

I think a queue is a good idea.  Also pipelining.  I mean, if your database is not the fastest, maybe try sending a bunch of inserts at a time, rather than one at a time.

Or use a faster database.  Or partition the tweets somehow and use multiple databases.

Or filter your twitter stream more?

My instinct is that it is best to avoid messing with the websocket level and handle it at a higher level because I think the road you are going down is going to have some interesting details but not be an efficient way to solve your problem in terms of developer time or code re-use down the line.

You could also take a look at http://datasift.com/ and http://gnip.com/ which might be a more convenient way to solve your business problem than directly accessing the firehose.

Have you done any testing with a real twitter stream and real database?  How much data is actually being sent down the hose on average? https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/7892  According to this it could be like 400GB of data per day for the full stream.  Or are you talking about spritzer or gardenose?

I think you pretty much have to filter out a lot of the data or aggregate it or shard it somehow.  Seems like too much data to store and keep querying.

Edit: CamintJS is a copy of JugglingDB. It didn't seem like they added anything to it, but I saw a post in its github issues from the creator of JugglingDB asking the guy to stop raising funds for the project since it was ripping off their code without crediting them.

I'm focusing on Postgres at the moment, and doing it in a way so that other DBs can have corresponding new classes written for them.

The system uses quite a lot of abstraction, it's fairly complicated because there are quite a lot of parts to it. It uses abstract models of the database, and works out what to do based on those, generating an Abstract Syntax Tree that contains the instructions to send to the database.

Also within scope is parsing DB code (such as to see what functions do).

Perhaps some others want to get involved in writing this code to make it do what they want?

I'm also representing DBs (and many other things) using a Resource object that enables asynchronous interaction through a standard interface (and can then be connected to an HTTP Resource Publisher to make it available as a JSON web service).I've heard about http://bookshelfjs.org/ but not yet used it myself.

Seems to be an active project that supports quite a lot of features. The webpage says it supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite (the Readme also  mentions MariaDB).";"https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline

- How about the faster `underscore` library by `lodash`, or the module name `lodash`?  Okay, bad example.
- Do you really prefer `michaelficarra/coffee-script` to `coffee-script-redux`?

The book is only $10 on LeanPub, and looks like a good frameworkless introduction into building a simple site with routing.You can use flatiron director[1] without a framework.

2014-12-26 19:51:32;socket.io v.1 VS Sock.js or other WebSocket implementations;"Etherpad core dev here.  

We just migrated to SocketIO v1+ from 0.9 and things are better.

I looked into other websocket implementations prior to settling on socketIO.   The main thing socketIO handles is cross platform relatively gracefully.  Other websocket implementations (at the time) had very little in the way of graceful fallback.

I can't vouch that Guillermo is going to keep being active on socket/engine IO though but he certainly has his hand involved.

I'd say SocketIO is your safe bet.

RE performance and scaling. This isn't PHP/Ruby, you wont hit the same type of early scaling issues.

Your communication layer will want to be as modular as possible so you can keep performance isolated to a single node initially and when it comes times, scale it out.

Hope that helps and good luck.Most of these posts are old and outdated. You should pick one with a reasonable API you like and start building your app. Make sure the IO layer is separate enough that it is not a big deal to swap later (this is not difficult and usually requires just a few more minutes of thought). I would also caution you against being bought into too many ""performance"" issue posts right now unless you have thousands of users ready to go today.

Projects like Primus are interesting but do note that they may carry their own bugs or opinions on implementation. Primus is likely one of the better ones as the author takes care to do his research and make sure it works.I've recently discovered [Primus](https://github.com/primus/primus) which is sort of an ORM for websocket connections.  It allows you to read session cookies from the header: https://github.com/primus/primus/issues/132

I've heard that socket.io recently has improved their performance issues however.

edit: poked around a bit and it looks like socket.io performances are still an issue: https://medium.com/@3rdeden/cluster-fucks-when-scaling-socket-io-2c8ad1153332Just to be pedantic `Engine.IO`, `Socket.IO` and `SockJS` are not WebSocket implementations. `ws`, `websocket`, `faye-websocket`, `yawl` are.Do not compare Sock.js to Socket.io. Compare it to Engine.io, socket's core.Thank you all.Just ran a test and yes Primus can read the cookies with Sock.js. I'll keep an eye on this project. If socket.io is working for you right now then stick at it. It can be a jump to go to sockjs, and if you arent actually recieving these issues in even the long term life of this app, then it isnt an issue for you.

2015-01-13 07:21:06;Question about memory limits in Node Webkit;"I apologize in advance for not answering your question. I'd just like to make a suggestion. As you say, you're reaching the memory limits for storing data in browser, which is understandable because the browser was never really meant to *process* or *store* data, but it's very good at visualizing it, as you mentioned.

Now that you're thinking about running your app outside of a browser tab (with node-webkit), you have a good opportunity to rethink your app a little bit. Firstly, you don't need to use node-webkit at all, since all it is is a packaged browser and node server. Instead you can simply provide your app as a webserver running on (for example) port 3000 that users can navigate to, which removes the overhead of having to download another browser. If you're running a separate server, you also have the potential to offload some of the processing to another language. You don't *have* to, you *could* fork node a few times and use it like a web worker (or there is a module [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webworker-threads) that simulates web workers on node, which I assume it does by forking), which is easy since you've already written the code. However you could also write the server in flask and use python to deal with the data processing. Something like numpy is going to be a lot faster than node, and most importantly will manage memory better because it's implemented natively.if you really need to have 13 GB of data in memory and compute on that data, don't force that data into the browser. 
Keep this data in a separate process outside the browser and stream into the browser only the data user is ACTuALLY seeing. Even with with millions of vertices/polygons, browser will be able to handle that without breaking a sweat(rendering in WebGL of course), because it is not going to be nowhere near those 13Gb.
How to stream it? Well you could run a node process(to which you can raise the memory limit as people were trying in this [thread](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=847)) which would stream this data over websockets. This should be quite easy to do. With node-webkit, you could just use interprocess communication. Your data processing might be written in any other language-C++ native app doesn't impose any limits on your memory in 64 bits. 
I personally would go with websockets, because then you open up a possibility for client to be over the network from your master process.

If you decide to go with node.js process for your data processing, be sure to checkout [io.js](https://iojs.org/), the latest version of V8 should make it easier to raise memory limits.[deleted]";"if you really need to have 13 GB of data in memory and compute on that data, don't force that data into the browser.

I'm sorry, that's really arrogant, and that just shows they're giving lip service to Windows being ""fully supported"".  This is a Explorer.exe related problem, use RoboCopy and your problem is gone.

Althoug the windows API won't allow more than 260 characters in a path with Explorer, the maximum total path length is ~32,767 characters.

RoboCopy uses different API calls.
FileZilla will also let you browse any depth in the local window.

Make sure to scan the changelog for breaking changes and you should be fine. For most intents and purposes it's fully backwards compatible (or at least as backwards compatible as you would expect new node.js releases to be).Many c++ packages need to be updated. Otherwise, it mostly works.Which node? Subbing in iojs for node 0.12 should be feasible since both were forked from 0.11 fairly recently. Pre-0.11 nodes, not so much.io.js is not compatible with node 0.10.x in similar cases to node 0.12.x. Request.js shows it quite well: https://travis-ci.org/request/request.

io.js after they fix [#456](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/456) : 10/10Edge cases. Just try.I'd say each pure js module has a small probability of breaking. Those with c++ bindings significantly higher. So it should really come down to looking at your dependencies and doing some back of the envelope calculations to determine the number of extra headaches you might have. 

As time goes on this may or may not be a non factor for iojs users depending on node package maintainer support. Or it might get worst since iojs is on a path to break things (for good reasons, let's not forget nodes stagnation).

I was at node summit when they announced the foundation and I'm pretty hopefully iojs gave the node maintainers the wakeup call they needed and things will merge back together. I'm pretty sure the foundation is in fact a strong, good reaction to the imminent fragmentation.

And fragmentation of the community quite frankly is quite awful. If you feel strongly about the new features of iojs I'd suggest you yell at the new node foundation, maybe even tell them you switched because x, y, z.NodeBB core dev here. I played around with io.js a bit via nvm, and NodeBB ran fairly well, but without having used it long-term or in production, I wouldn't know what kind of edge cases there would be. I'd imagine there may be some via our socket.io dependency. 

Ghost, on the other hand, relies on SQLite, which doesn't compile easily on 0.11, so that may also be a blocker for you on io.js...

https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/1373> Now, failed stat's are not the entire reason require is slow, but if I am reading the timestamps correctly in the strace log, they are a fair amount of it, and the most obviously wasteful thing.

A lesson to learn from the past that gets lost in all the shit-talking: This is why optcode caching developed in PHP. The rise of PHP frameworks like Kohana would not have happened without alleviating the stress a bunch of empty file stats cause when searching for includes. Toss a bunch of complex DB queries on that and yeah, you've got the shitty performance from PHP for complexities in 2003 all over again. Even Ruby is learning this lesson with projects like [jRuby](http://jruby.org/), which is essentially optcode caching inside a JVM.

To be fair though, it's not require() itself that's slow - it's file i/o. Perhaps your tool chain is doing more of that than it should via require(), but that's something the developers of those modules should keep in mind when writing their modules. Keep things lean with fewer secondary dependencies and things are nice and fast. Also, if you're shipping a production module, please make a fully minified and concatenated version.

Personally, I think this is the main reason to avoid large, swiss-army-knife, do-it-all frameworks. In some ways you made the choice in convenience over speed. Good luck to you.Really wish you added the qualifier of '**Nodes** Require is Dog Slow` in the title like the article does.

I have never seen such slowness using requirejs on the frontend...in case anyone is wondering.

2015-08-08 16:37:29;how do you debug a node app that doesn't crash but stops working?;"This is actually pretty common in evented systems.  I call it ""getting zombified"".

Logging is your friend, but I don't see any at all.  At the very least you *always* need error logging.  Now that you need to additionally debug, you'll want to have more logging than just errors to give you a hint of where the process got zombified.  `console.log()` and `console.error()` are fine for this to start.  If you run multiple of these processes, an aggregated logging service might be needed.

I also see eventemitters without any attached 'error' handler, or really many event handlers in general.  Log all that stuff.  Sometimes the most foolproof way to handle these errors is to log it and then let the process actually exit (maybe `process.exit(1)`).  Sometimes you'll want to do some other clean-up before you restart.  I assume systemd will restart it in a fresh state if you exit.

The other thing I do for monitoring is I put a metric on the work that this does.  Usually using some metrics app like graphite, datadog, librato, etc.  I treat that a bit like a heartbeat and alert when work has stopped for too long.  Maybe you have multiple scenarios that could count as a heart beat: both emit() cases, and the successful http request case.  If setting up metrics seems like too much work, at least log it and you can search the logs for the area where these heartbeat metrics stop.Maybe double check memory usage another way to make sure its not a memory leak.  Also write some console.error and make sure you are able to monitor the logs.  Maybe there was some exception that went in a different file than you were looking?  Also see https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/1015

Also you could try launching a different way in case the behavior changes (like just with pm2 or no supervisor, maybe a more obvious crash).  Also you could check resource usage like open files or connections.

Also there are alternatives like sockjs.

But restarting the server might not be so bad if your client can detect it and reconnect or reconnect after a 'reboot' message.

Also try to be very sure there isn't some other separate but related process on the system causing instability.

Another obvious thing that might or might not help: https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.htmlYou probably have a memory leak somewhere and are leaving file descriptors open.

`soundtrack_stats` doesn't seem to ever been cleared but I don't feel that is enough. Have you checked socket.io documentation?Pipe the process to a log on startup. Check that after its stopped working. I've had unhandled errors and other weird 'crash' like behavior that doesn't actually terminate the node instance, but causes it to stop responding entirely.Maybe using try/catch in each bkock for debugging purposes Let me suggest a slightly different approach: there are tools which analyse node.js applications end-to-end. They are built to measure performance and identify bottlenecks.

Ruxit is a new SaaS solution which auto-detects your node.js application end-to-end. You just have to install the agent on your server, restart it and the rest is done by the tool. 

If you want to give it a try: there is a 30-day free trial and it takes less than 5 minutes to see data. 

https://ruxit.com/nodejs-monitoring/

Disclosure: I work for Ruxit, so don't believe me, try it yourself. But if it helps to solve your issues please let us know and spread the word ;-)

1. I'm not familiar with the breaking changes

2. io.js is the ""canary"" branch of Node. I recommend, if you're on a Node stable release, to consider migrating to latest (0.12). btw, 0.10.40 is the [latest patch](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.40/).

2015-08-28 14:20:53;Node Standard Library;"The problem I have with this is that once a certain module becomes popular and then goes in your standard, if I ever have to work with a group using that standard and find a better module then I have to argue with them about why its better and whether it integrates properly with the other modules.

So you are increasing coupling while encouraging stagnation and cargo-culting.

I know there are a ton of modules and its hard to sort out the best ones, but I suspect this might not be the best way.  It might be the worst idea ever for Node.node already has a standard library: https://nodejs.org/api/

For module discovery, focused packages are easier to find than all-in-one grab bags:
https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/17#issuecomment-5863086

Documentation, tests, and contributing is also easier with separate packages when the versions of packages can iterate independently of one another. With a grab-bag standard library, if one function changes its signature in a breaking way, the entire package should update its major version, even though each function is relatively independent.

From what I've seen in sprawling ""batteries included"" approaches in other languages, standard libraries are where software goes to die. Bugs calcify into features and you can't ever break an API because versions are completely coupled. Better libraries emerge in the ecosystem, but the standard library has to either ignore them to focus on stability or take in every new idea, breaking frequently and having a meaningless release cycle.

If you want to introduce curation, using the module loader is a terrible idea. There are so many other better ways.Interesting concept. Is this going to be A) basically a vetted list of existing packages, B) forks of existing packages, C) a bunch of from-scratch packages?There is nothing in there.

2015-10-06 09:32:04;Why ES6 Has Classes;"Does not justify the 'why' part.

> The answer is that classes and inheritance are core aspects of JavaScript development and there is a standard way to do them in ES6 using the class and extends keywords.

Needs examples and more reasoning....What is this even? What are you even on about? 

The concept of a class and implementation of classes in Javascript are two completely different things. You've literally made no valid points for the *class* keyword which is being introduced in ES6.

If we look at TypeScript's transpilation of the class keyword, we can see that classes are basically closures that return a user-defined object type.

```
var Car = (function () {
    function Car() {
    }
    return Car;
})();
```

One of the biggest arguments against ES6 classes are that it's just syntactical sugar around basic JavaScript patterns. You haven't mentioned this at all. In fact, the more I read your page the worse it gets. What does React.js have anything to do this JavaScript classes? Why did you even make this page?

**Edit:** if this isn't enough, you went and [opened a GitHub issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3209) on the Node.js repo that directly contradicts the points made in this article. Idk if anyone else feels this way, but right now I believe a big solid **fuck off** is warranted. We already have enough noise in the Node.js community.I think your point is that where there were once many ways to make a JavaScript class-like object, there is now one preferred way.  It is a valid point but somewhat obscured by the rhetorical voice you employ in this story.  I would suggest you rewrite your argument a little.  Just a kind suggestion.  If you do please consider dropping me a note here: https://github.com/Hypercubed/javascript-the-esoteric-parts";"...What is this even? What are you even on about?

2016-01-17 16:15:54;Is Express.js dying?;"Considering all of the projects which rely directly on express, I don't believe it will be dying anytime soon. For example there is kraken, which is built by PayPal. PayPal uses that framework internally and probably won't be getting rid of it anytime soon. So unless they replace express with something else in their framework they have to rely on it. This is just one of many framework presently relying on Express 
On top of that, Express really is more of an extension the node libraries than it is a new framework. To me it seems like how node hTTP is supposed to be. This is different with other frameworks, for example sails or hapi, which feel more like entirely new libraries. They stand out as being amazing libraries, but Express really stands out for feeling like in a natural extension of the node core libraries.
I don't feel as though we going away anytime soon. That being said, it has bothered me for some time that strongloop purchased it. That purchase has made me personally question where the framework will go.Dude, seriously? That's the best way to actually kill a project.

When a project has matured, it is perfectly normal, even healthy, that development slows down. I would worry if it didn't.

The reason is because Node's feature support is tied to V8.For now, you need to use a transpiler that supports module loading/bundling (Babel, Traceur, TypeScript, rollup, etc). 

Long story short, there are multiple module specifications/standards in JavaScript (ES6, CommonJS, AMD, and UMD). Most backend JS engines implemented CommonJS when they were first created (Node.js, MongoDB, PhantomJS). ES6 module standard is relatively new and is semantically different from CommonJS (as in not 100% compatible), so most engines haven't gotten around to implement support for it. 

Here's an issue reported in Node.js repo of your problem: 
https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/31

If you don't want to use transpiler, you should stick with CommonJS import: 

    var express = require('express');

In case you are wondering how CommonJS and ES6 module systems differ beyond just syntax: they differ in how they handle ""default"" exports and how they resolve circular dependencies. dont think that's supported yet without babel.
on this page you can find more info on what is supported (you need to use strict mode for most too) : https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/I think you need to use babel for imports, might be wrong.Try require instead?Node does not natively support full ES6. You can, however, write ES6 and compile to ES5. 
Here is a small useful starter:
https://github.com/liady/es6-library-minimal[deleted]";"For now, you need to use a transpiler that supports module loading/bundling (Babel, Traceur, TypeScript, rollup, etc). 

Long story short, there are multiple module specifications/standards in JavaScript (ES6, CommonJS, AMD, and UMD). Most backend JS engines implemented CommonJS when they were first created (Node.js, MongoDB, PhantomJS). ES6 module standard is relatively new and is semantically different from CommonJS (as in not 100% compatible), so most engines haven't gotten around to implement support for it. 

Here's an issue reported in Node.js repo of your problem: 
https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/31

If you don't want to use transpiler, you should stick with CommonJS import: 

    var express = require('express');

2016-02-05 17:05:16;How to ease concerns about scalability and maintainability in Node/Express.;"I'd say scalability and maintainability is mainly achieved by good application design rather than a language or stack you pick. In my company we are currently shifting to microservices to achieve that. Small services can be scaled independently. Also maintaining a small project is way easier than a monolith. And nodejs is just great at microservices if you use it with pm2 and shipit. 

As already mentioned take a look at koa. I find it even easier and cleaner to use. Your developers just have to wrap their heads around promises and generators which can be weird at first sight.This is an opinionated reply; you've been warned.

I find that most applications that are badly structured or don't use common programming paradigms fall into the same pit of lacking maintainability. I've seen many ASP.NET applications become nightmares to work with so maintainability for me is all about design decisions: moving away from monolithic architecture, following a code convention, agreeing on project structure, etc.

In regards to scalability I can't give you hard, concrete advice because I haven't run an external service in production that receives 10,000 requests a second. However, here are some ideas I would tackle if I were faced with the situation where I need to make my Node.js application massively scalable.

Node.js is single-threaded. Unless you are taking advantage of Node's `cluster` feature, which I would suggest you stay away from for the sake of simplicity, this means your multi-core servers aren't getting put to good use. Luckily, there is a Node.js application named [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) which will easily let you spin up multiple processes of your Node.js application on different cores (which it itself uses `cluster` to perform load balancing). If you design your application in a way where it is stateless, you can launch an instance of your application per core (so 8 instances on an 8 core machine). You can even commission more machines running PM2 and use NGINX to load balance between those machines. Again, just an idea.

When benchmarking Flask using `ab` on my local computer I noticed some severe performance issues compared to Node.js. Obviously, there are better ways to benchmark but that was enough to disqualify Flask for me. I've looked at Go and frankly I don't like the language at all. I find it to be a mess and extremely painful to work with. If your team likes Go then maybe you should go down that route but I wouldn't jump on the hype train just yet.

While there are questions about Node.js and its future, major companies are already behind it and using it in production for real use cases (Netflix, Uber, PayPal). It's no longer the new shiny and you can bet that the market for Node.js will grow. Development on many Node.js modules is still underway due to ES7 so the goal really is to pick something that works for you.

One last bit: Express is not the only web server framework for Node.js out there. There's also Koa and hapi. I would recommend doing some research on each of these to see if it's something that might interest you.

Don't let people dissuade you. While Node.js isn't the silver bullet everyone wants, it's definitely very powerful and I can attest to its simplicity. Don't do CPU intensive operations on a Node.js process and you'll be fine. Find something you like using, make sure it can be run reliably in production, and then ship it.Express has been going through some questions recently [about its future](https://github.com/strongloop/express/issues/2844). It does look like it is going to move to the Node foundation soon so that may alleviate any worry about its long-term future. As of right now its basically a rudderless project.

Its very difficult even after all these years to find a  good example of a long-term maintainable Express-based project with code you can review. There may be a lot of these running behind closed doors, but for the most part, if you look online its just a lot of small example apps, **and its been years**.

JavaScript suffers a bit from [TMTOWTDI] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it) which makes maintainability tough unless your team keeps the ""how we do it"" very strictly controlled. Callbacks, Promises, Async, Modularity, Testing, it can all add up to a mess if people are not in lock-step with how to get things done. 

There are also a lot of choices besides Angular for the front-end stuff. It is leading to [JavaScript fatigue](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4) and this may become an issue for you depending on how long you think you will be working with this stack. It seems like no matter what stack (& tooling) is being recommend this month, things could look very different in the near future. You don't have problems like this to this degree with PHP. 

You may want to add something like Go to your evaluation, it is not as well known as JS, but has alleviated some of these problems [for some teams](http://thenewstack.io/from-node-js-to-go-why-one-startup-made-the-switch/).

Wish I could be more helpful. Been feeling a bit of this burnout myself. :(
Do a PoC and prove it out. 

If you are interested in microservices look into nearForm as they have been doing microservices with node for years. 

There are plenty of case studies to help persuade management, just have to look. 

Join your local node meetup and attend the meetings. The node community is a social one, you can gain a lot of insight from talking to others. Check out Strongloop and Koa. Koa is from the original devs of express and has some interesting work going on, and is designed around middleware. Strongloop/loopback is pretty mature and allows rapid development and has an Angular SDK, common models shared by angular and your backend, and has some neat API creation features (swagger is under the hood). Strongloop/loopback was also just acquired by IBM so it will probably get support from them for a good while. But still open source.

Recommend doing the loopback app tutorials to get a quick demo up. Good luck!So, firstly I'm an c# dude ( senior dev), and I mostly use both asp.net mvc and node js ( I hate Web forms, they suck).  Now that this is out of the way, my 2 cents :

It's all about the team that works the project,  if they are open minded and ready to jump ship on the new tech stack... 
I currently an involved as tech lead for an IoT management project that uses node,  all of the team, except me are seasoned net devs with no js xp ,  they went from hating it to accepting it and started to be a bit productive. The bad part is that in the first month I had to review and explain mostly everything,  the velocity was quite crappy. 

Now things started to go smoth. 
I haven't said anything about the technology performance cause it's all about your architecture and how you build it. We use Travis rabbit docker just to name a few..Like most people said, its really about good design and practices etc. rather than a particular stack that determine maintainability and scalability.

Having said that, Node.js and JavaScript are currently excellent in terms of enabling both maintainability and scalability.  I did development in C# on the desktop and web server for several years before mainly doing PHP for a few years and then moving on to Node.js.  So from experience I know that moving to Node and JavaScript is a big win for scalability and maintainability.  Of course, it will take a significant amount of time to become familiar with new programming languages and platforms, and good design and practices are important as always.

# Maintainability

## Modular Design

Modular design has a huge impact on maintainability.  Modular design is the focus of Node.js application design.  There are more than 200,000 packages on npm because of this focus that Node developers have on well-factored code and code re-use.  The `npm` system is first class in terms of packaging up dependencies, handling semantic versioning, etc.

## Component Support

The latest versions of ECMAScript (in latest browsers or with babel) now have great support for classes.  Angular 1 and now 2 have very strong support for UI components.  The latest version of ECMAScript is an excellent language overall and I highly encourage you to use it.

## Impedance Mismatch

Developing with MongoDB eliminates the object-relational impedance mismatch (I would stay away from Mongoose personally).

## ESLint

ESLint and similar tools will help catch syntax errors before your tests.

## TDD/BDD

There is also a strong culture of test-driven/behavior-driven development in Node and JavaScript communities.  Automated testing can make a massive improvement in maintenance turnaround if you consider the time tracking down bugs from changes.

# Scalability

## Asynchronous I/O by Default

Waiting for IO can kill the effective performance of a synchronous server application. The default operating mode for Node.js's input/output, however, is asynchronous, which means your application doesn't get held up waiting for one IO operation to complete.  This means that one process can handle thousands of requests in a short time.  Compare that with something like a PHP application running on Apache server where each user request might be using the resources of an entire process, and you can see massive scalability gains from the start.  (I know, most people don't use Apache anymore, but you will still see big resource efficiency gains). 

Now with babel and the new `async/await` syntax you get that default concurrent input/output along with a simple synchronous syntax.
 
## Server/VM Cost

Also, compared to something like Windows, Node.js runs on Linux, which depending on the system can have a fairly tiny resource footprint compared to a Windows server.  Linux cloud servers also cost less than Windows.Question, when you say 'he knows ASP', you don't mean actual ASP do you?  Because there used to be this thing many years ago called ASP, that came before and was totally different from ASP.NET.  No one uses classic ASP anymore for new projects that I know of.Maintainability and enterprise support are the two main focuses of the node maintainers right now.

If you're in an environment where c# is used, have a look at nodesource.  These guys are at a lot of the sfnode meetups giving talks and long term support for real ""grown up"" companies and graduating node from being seen as more of a startup /io only kind of platform is seen as the future.

Same stance from the npm folks.  In my opinion there's never been a better time to start your organization moving in a node direction.

Just, as other people have mentioned, focus on microservices.  With devops more or less being a solved problem with docker, Heroku, etc, there's no reason why any part of your system needs to be monolithic.   Lots of tiny applications with one job makes testing and architecture much easier.

Your c# guy will be blown away in six months :)";"Express has been going through some questions recently [about its future](https://github.com/strongloop/express/issues/2844).

2016-02-22 12:13:18;Using Node.js Event Loop for Timing Attacks;"TLDR: You can hack a password  by determining the amount of time it takes for requests to be processed. 

For each character that you guess correctly, the API will take slightly longer because it's doing a character by character comparison. 

The take away is use a fixed time (independent of length) password validation algorithm. XORing the password with the one stored is recommended. 
So I guess that this would be solved by using hashes, am I correct with that assumption?I still have yet to see any convincing evidence that timing attacks are feasible over the Internet. Reposting my comment from /r/netsec because I think it's still relevant:

The write-up is interesting but the target server implementation they gave is a very very contrived example and would never exist is reality.

Although timing attacks are possible theoretically, I have never been able to create a proof of concept against JavaScript or other interpreted, high-level languages.

Even in the best-case scenario where you can time the execution directly inside the source code rather than sampling it through the HTTP response time, I still can't find a proof of concept.

I'd honestly love to see someone prove me wrong and write a working proof of concept for this (modified) vulnerable code sample they gave:

    function isAuthenticated(correctToken, token) {
        return correctToken === token;
    }

If we do take theoretical attacks into account, then we'll also have to take into account that V8 (the Node.js JIT) could optimise-out their proposed constant time compare mitigation as stated in:

2016-03-10 09:02:39;Reliable Node.js ORM for RDBMS;"I've been using Objection.js for a while now and love it! It's a good combination of ""staying out the way"" and powerful features.

Here (https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/11) you can find pointers on the Objection vs. Bookshelf discussion. And incase you missed it, theres a bunch examples in ES5, ES6 and even ES7 in the repo (https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/tree/master/examples).

Hope that helps out!for SLQ dbs, knex is the best IMHO.I'm going to strongly recommend against using Sequelize. I had nothing but nightmares with it. Just don't even bother.

KnexJS is the way to go, it's simple, behaves in a predictable manner, and is basically 1:1 with SQL.

As you need to access data from your DB, use the MySQL or Postgres CLI to write the query and experiment. Once you're happy with the query, translate it to Knex calls and move on to your next feature. No surprises, no frustrating ""How do I translate this SQL to sequelize calls?""

By the way, SQL is *super* high level, I don't know how a huge collection of programmers got duped into believing they need an ORM for their project.Go on bookshelfjs site and under the ""projects using boohshelf"" section is a project called soapee. It's written in es6 and is a great reference for how to set things upI was in your same boots about a month ago. I had heard great things about Sequelize and assumed it was the best so that's what I used. Ugh what a nightmare it was. There were so many undocumented ""features"" and no explanation on how to do certain things. Here is a perfect example of me complaining about missing documentation: https://github.com/sequelize/cli/issues/261

I took a step back and found http://bookshelfjs.org/ which is an ORM that wraps around another library called Knex. Knex isn't really an ORM but rather a query builder.

Anyways, I jumped over to using Knex and it was SOOOO much easier and faster to learn than Sequelize. I never looked back. At some point I'll convert some of my code to use BookshelfJS since it integrates with it.

So yeah. +1 for Knex / BookshelfJS.    -1 for Sequelize even though it seems very popular.As /u/bschwind mentioned, I would be advising you to stay way form Sequelize. If you still insist on using one, knex looks fine. Have a look at node-orm2! 

Regarding your ES6 issue, why not try it yourself? I don't think having ORM alone in ES5 will work, but you can turn it off only for ORM part, but not 100% sure until we do so.There is also http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest> particularly how do i convey exports.up/exports.down in es6?

you can probably just do 

    export function up() {}

or you may have to just use CJS modules for that one set of files, which answers your question yes you can have the knesxfile use node style modules and the rest of your app compile to es6 with babel.  That being said you can use a good portion of ES6 in node without having to compile anything (including classes, arrow functions, generators, const/let) so it might make more sense to not compile anything and use ES5 modules along with the ES6 features of node.I've been using [Massive.js](https://github.com/robconery/massive-js) -- it's for PostgresQL only, but it's less of an ORM, more of a ""helper"" library.I haven't found one I really like and is documented well with good tutorials.

edit: I made a little blog post about the migration from koa v1 to v2. I'm happy to PM you the link or post it here in this comment thread. (I already posted it to this subreddit a little while back). Basically, if you plan ahead just a little, the migration from v1 to v2 will be very easy once Node supports async/await natively. 

Changing the function signatures might even be something that could be automated with a custom babel plugin. I think a series of regex operations could even do it.I'm using Koa2 for a REST API, no problems with stability or debugging so far. I'm transpiling using babel with source map support. I guess the biggest down side I've encountered is lack of V2 middleware and V2 documentation. There is a [module](https://github.com/koajs/convert) for converting V1 middleware to V2. The lack of docs isn't too much of an issue as Koa is very minimalistic in the first place, but there are some Koa2 project examples floating around on Github/elsewhere.Read this https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/533 , I don't know anyone who migrated, but I guess someone must have.Note: Koa 2 actually has zero dependency on async/await. All you need is functions that return promises. So if you're worried about transpiling server-side code, just to get async/await, you could do:

    co.wrap(function*(next, ctx) { yield next; })

...wherever you'd normally do:

    async function(next, ctx) { await next; }

No transpilation necessary. It wouldn't be a very deep refactor to sweep through later and update to async functions, since the semantics are so similar.";Read this https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/533 , I don't know anyone who migrated, but I guess someone must have.;node

Read up on parameterized inputs / prepared statements ( https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Prepared-Statements ) to see how the module implements them or dig through source. For my application I have built a 'factory' for handling pg statements that utilize parameters.

Even the makers of gyp hate it.[obligatory link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDbYMw8JRYY)Truth.

I could never figure out why it didn't work, because the error it kept spitting out was pretty much telling me i needed the visual studio stuff, which i had.

i have never really had good experiences with gyp. even in other environments like linux it can be problematicNode gyp is especially annoying because ignores npm CA file setting which is already annoying because that ignores the system ca information. 

Having python 2 along side python 3 is annoying too. Leave py3 as default and set the python path to 2 in npmrc. The Rant is well deserved I just picked this crap up and it is beyond annoying.I have never seen a piece of software which embodies the ""Works On My Machine!"" principle better than node-gyp

I've seen people get everything working in two minutes, while the person sitting next to them spent a day of Googling and trying random crap until it magically worked.The problem manifests itself in node-gyp, but node-gyp isn't the core problem.

The problem is that there are deep dependencies that require **compiling.** IOW, Node and it's default libraries aren't good enough... someone decided to go write a  module in a foreign compiled language to go along side the standard node/language binaries.

***Why? Why is this necessary?*** 

Maybe I'm missing something here, but it seems to me that allowing package manager distribution of foreign source code is a bad idea on many many levels.Might I suggest: https://golang.org/ ?

Antivirus (especially what I have, Avast), distrusts terminal apps and runs higher levels of scrutiny on them before letting them launch.Look for an issue on npm or Node repos.

Also make sure you are using the latest Node and npm.
Also can try `pnpm` which does symlinks.

Also make sure your disk is performing in terms of random reads/writes.

There is also cygwin.

But yeah I just installed Lubuntu on Virtual Box last night (download ISO via torrent).

Easier is to use putty with a cheap VPS like Linode or Digital Ocean or EC2 reserved (don't get the cheapest it gets throttled).  I usually just use that with vim and fish shell which means I just type one character and fish recalls the build command or whatever based on the dir I am in.You could also try the Linux Subsystem.There are a few things you can try:

1 - If you can upgrade to node V6 (which is the new LTS release) this should also upgrade your npm. Naturally though when upgrading to a new major version in SemVer there will be breaking changes so some troubleshooting may be involved however the good news is because it's LTS you shouldnt have to worry too much about it again till 2018.

If you really can't upgrade to nodeV6, keep your nodeV4 and try to upgrade NPM to version 3 manually as it should still have a noticable difference due to the fact V3 implements package leveraging (i.e. if 2 or more packages have the same dependency instead of installing it twice it's moved to the root and the original packages just reference it).

2 - This is a recent [presentation from JSconf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWEU8kNKi3Q) which outlines a few things, in particular configuration options, which should be of interest of you -

a. Use `--save-bundle` when you construct your projects.

b. Config `--cache-min 999999`

3 - I suggest this as a last option as it involves changing some of the core of NPM itself, furthermore it may not be necessary if you can upgrade to node V6 (note the date was a few months prior to its release), but in the interest of being thorough.

Now from here you have a few options:

1. You can tell bunyan to log JSON or whatever to stdout/stderr for journald to pick up and then forward on to logstash directly
2. Have bunyan log to stdout/stderr and submit JSON to logstash directly.

Personally, Id go with option 1 as journald can output logs as a JSON blob which can then be easily parsed by logstash directly (see [this github discussion](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/1729)).

Might want to check https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken/issues/111 which in part addresses your concern.The fastest result for a single operation is not always the highest priority.

Making the method support both sync and async signatures gives the consuming code the option to choose.

2016-07-09 19:13:46;Why NOT Koa?;"Koa is great because it's so tiny, that any reasonable Node dev can wrap his or her head around it's implementation. koa@2 is built around async/await instead of generators https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/533I've been using it for around 2 years, it's great.  It's very lightweight, has a good amount of useful middleware, and the generator flow is much better (in my opinion).

A few things:

* Even though the ""error handling"" is better, it's not perfect.  You regain try/catch over async operations, but the stack traces usually dead end in the corresponding promise library.
* You would best to get familiar with co.js.  Many libraries are not yet promise based, so you'll have to be conscious of promisifying libraries when needed.
* Streams are a little bit more painful in a generator based framework.  You *can* pipe a stream to the response body, but it gets more complicated to do transformation streams.  At any rate, none of this has stopped me, just had to learn more.

I recommend it.  It's hard to go back once you've started using the generator workflow, and it paves the way for ES7 async/await, which hopefully addresses the issues above.I think mostly it's just that people haven't started using it all that much.

If it fits your needs, isn't too hard to maintain, and doesn't have any drawbacks, you should totally use it.

I'm actually curious, since I'm in the same boat if I should switch.  (I probably will)it's more about the ecosystem, for example you can use passport.js in express _directly_ while for KOA you can not, many things like that so express can still win as a whole I assume.Don't use async.

2016-07-15 16:31:12;What is the proper way to learn how to use databases in Node?;"do you already know sql?  IMO things like Sequelize are for those that don't know how to make schemas, or just don't want to for whatever reasons.

you're certainly free to just exec the queries direct using a library for the DB you want to use.  there's not really a ""proper"" node way to do data storage.It depends on the library you're using. Also what's your specific problem?  

Also srry for rambling after this point I'm on mobile and can't easily format my response. Or even see more than four lines at a time so if it's unclear what I'm talking about let me know and I'll try to clarify.

I'm looking at the sequilize docs and I don't use SQL databases yet I feel like I could craft quite the database using that documentation. Heck it even creates new tables when they don't exist!! I dont event have to mess with the DB. 

The big thing that I found helped when hitting an odd problem is doing what you just did ask for help, you might be looking at the problem incorrectly or googling the wrong keywords. <-- TRUST ME knowing what keywords to search can help tremendously. 

But even before asking for help online I find it easiest to get on github and read the docs. It's all in one place instead of in snippets like on most websites. You can find the index file see how it initializes how it handles arguments and what arguments it's looking for. Then you can see how the different modules/methods handle those arguments. 

Lastly the best way to learn is to dregd through the difficult times, remember take a break, take a walk, you might just need a little separation from the screen so instead of typing away and failing you're forced to say okay, when I execute `sequilize.define({userData})` it does this then my next line of code creates a row on my DB table. Then the callback returns an error or success. Then I can return that object to the client by attaching it to the req.body or some req.customSubObjectHolder so that when you write next(); in that middleware your next middleware will have access to the req.customSubObjectHolder and can send to the client or manipulate it further.

Because remember your database is not the backend it's the DB and node is the applications backend. So they're on different servers. Hence the callback to node saying error or success. I always use the callback option when interacting with the DB even if it only returns errors so that I know oh it was the DB server and not my code. Or if there's an error on the DB (maybe: incorrect types of data or malformed object) the database might have a wrote error but you wouldn't know it was your node code causing the error unless you had the callback/promises letting you know. 

Also remember if youre using a library like sequilize then most likely any DB errors are because you wrote something wrong in your node app and the malformed object is trying to interact with the DB causing the error.

I use [Restify Model](https://github.com/baseprime/restify-model) for a lot of my projects. It's like Sails or Django Rest Framework (for node). However, it doesn't support database migrations by default.I have been trying out feathersjs, and it's pretty sweet how fast it is to get started, and with very little code.Not a single mention of hapi or [Nodal](https://github.com/keithwhor/nodal)... two pretty big API players to leave out.Holy moley, these are the most unimaginative picks possible. ""Magnificent?"". API's, MVC, templating, all of them doing the same thing the others are doing.

Not saying they're not quality frameworks, but at best I'll use them in my projects just to get that stuff out of the way - I have zero desire to work on them.Wow, you shamelessly steal [this simple image](https://www.google.ca/search?q=nodejs+frameworks&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjP6ITZuIDPAhVKVh4KHTLuBI4Q_AUICCgB&biw=1280&bih=699#imgrc=W8bEWmN2G3DmmM%3A) from [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOVmr6CjgNw) and don't even mention **Strongloop** framework, which is quite amazing btw. Strongloop is one of the few NodeJS platforms that has strong convention, awesome scaffolding tool and well documented API. Plus its not going anywhere, since this company was acquired by IBM and continues the development.  ";"Might worth mentioning that Sails is slowing down releases and a lot of Sails eco-system packages are now halted in favour of [Trails](https://github.com/trailsjs/trails)
Nevertheless, a great framework to work with, very easy to get started.

2017-01-24 02:05:41;"How to send an HTTP response (for example using Express), when a ""unhandledRejection"" promise error occures?";"Just don't let things get to the global exception handler. 

The idea of the global handler is that things have gotten to a point where something has gotten out of control. You are now in a situation that your code doesn't know how to handle. You should log the exception that occurred. If it's serious enough, maybe you need to consider calling process.exit and letting your process manger start up a new process (you are using a process manager right. Pm2, docker, cloudfoundry, something). 

The purpose of the exception handler is for you to log out the exception somewhere and then not let that happen again. Just make sure the rejection doesn't bubble back up out of the request. It's easy if you use async/await:

    app.get('/xyz', (req, res, next) => {
      Promise.resolve().then(async () => {
        const x = await y(req.query.something);

        res.status(200).send({
          x,
        });
      }).catch(error => next(error)); // or do something else to handle the rejection...
    });You might want to use [express' error handler](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html) instead of `process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)`

    app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
      console.error(""Unhandled Rejection"", err.stack);
      res.send(500).send(""Unknown Error"");
    });This was sort of the what node domains: https://nodejs.org/api/domain.html and ""zones"" were trying to solve with async code.

RethinkDB the company failed and so they moved the project from being supported by a ""mother"" company to being supported by the OSS community. I have used it for every project I could do from scratch in the past 2-3 years and it is pretty awesome. Soon they will release a next version. Also I don't think that people don't use it because of their needs. I think it's more of a standard-thingy. Just as MySQL did for SQL - MongoDB did get the standard for NoSQL. People just don't know about it. But I am pretty certain that if MongoDB continues just like they do right now it will change ;)This is a post mortem why they failed
http://www.defstartup.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html

As for why it is not used....
I guess people prefer to go with MongoDb which has a bigger community.  Easier to get answers + ""nobody was fired for buying IBM"".Because for me it kind of sucked. It couldn't ingest more than 10,000 records (or some relatively low number) at a time. It timed out during the ingestion phase, and it couldn't handle many connections at once.

I switched to MongoDB with little code change and saw all of these problems go away.All of the cursor book keeping is a price that must be paid 

I think rethink is great but what advantage is it over Postgres and redid pub/sub for any real time subscribing you'd need?   Just inject your own hooks to your software rather than let the database book keep them

Your code might be slightly less elegant but lots more scalable.  And also if you have other disparate events, they'll run through this a lot easier.  After seeing so many complex projects fail I'd rather go for simpler building blocks like Postgres and redis.[deleted]The change feeds feature looks pretty interesting. Is it possible to turn off the ""old_val"" ? In my usecase, old_val is irrelevant...

Also, would this scale well if I use web sockets and have thousands of potential changefeed observers?

I'm looking into making widgets similar to espn.com/nba game score widgets that update when the score changes.

Can I just use Rethinkdb handle this alone, or do I need to throw redis on top of it and then use redis for handling pub/subs? That would be disappointing. :[I use it, its so much better then mongodb... the things you can do, oh baby...

2017-05-15 12:56:06;Objection.js ORM;"[deleted]Now that's how you write proper documentation that includes examples and common use-cases. Usually you have to go through an awful lot of trickery to get relations working in ORMs but with this one it's literally the first example after defining a model. Great job, will definitely use this. As a side note; Objection.js is quite different compared to a traditional ORM. Actually, the creators themselves communicate it as:

> knex.js on steroids
*(knex being the query builder objection.js builds upon)*

It leverages pure SQL. As an example it doesn't have the common `Model#save()` method. Instead relies on an extended `objection.QueryBuilder#insert()`which accepts a model object but in practice works much like the regular `knex.QueryBuilder#insert()`.

I myself used Sequelize and bookshelf.js and while both have their strengths neither compares to objection.js when it comes to malleability *(I personally dislike both Sequelize and bookshelf.js for other subjective reasons)*. If you're an ""out-of-the-box"" application, or utilising PostgreSQL JSONB data types heavily - objection.js is the way to go IMHO. I've been using objection.js for a production application recently and have been very impressed, coming from experience with Sequelize and Loopback ORMs.

My main gripe with Loopback was that the ORM doesn't let you [filter on related properties](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/683), which is a *huge* omission and results in quite a bit of working around the framework to get what you need.

The ability to drop down to knex when required is a huge help, especially when dealing with something that's slightly out of the scope of an ORM.Now you have no excuse for defaulting to MongoDB when starting a new Node project

2017-06-18 02:48:13;nodejs, yo, Docker local dev container issue;"It appears `yo` *really* doesn't like being run as root.  

It attempts to change the current user of the running process to some other uid - but it doesn't change the home directory, so when the command runs it is run as non-root and attempts to read files in `/root`, and you get permission defined.

Seems like a half-measure intended to save people from potential security flaws of generators - which is admirable, who knows what those generators include and what they run as.... but the end result is if you run as root in a docker container, it blows up.

Kind of funny, it will always attempt to downgrade root

https://github.com/sindresorhus/root-check/blob/v1.0.0/index.js#L7

Which changes the user and the group:

https://github.com/sindresorhus/downgrade-root/blob/v1.2.2/index.js#L8-L19

But it won't kill your process, or tell you something is wrong if you are running in Docker... it will however blow up with an EACCES exception due to the change in user and reading files from `/root`, that's nice of them:

https://github.com/sindresorhus/sudo-block/blob/master/index.js#L9

...Unrelated, but that is some next-level module abstraction.  How many npm modules does it take to screw in a lightbulb?  I've listed 3 in those links, didn't need to link `is-root`, `is-docker` or `is-sudo`.

Anyway, the easiest way to get around this is.... don't run as root.  

Set up a user at the top of the dockerfile with a home directory and shell of `/bin/false`, update the npm prefix to point at that user's home directory and switch to that user when running the global install commands.

Occasionally, the YCM daemon (ycmd) is updated and YCM needs to be rebuilt (YCM informs you when this needs to be done):

    $ cd ~/.vim/plugins/YouCompleteMe
    $ ./install.py --tern-completerYou should already have [omni-completion](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Omni_completion) by clicking the menu key. It's mostly just a completion that matches within the file itself and usually works well for most of my needs.You might try TypeScript's language service.  It works with plain JS - I'm not trying to force you to change your code at all - and I'm pretty sure it has a Vim integration.the best completion i've gotten so far has been from [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) with a [tern source](https://github.com/carlitux/deoplete-ternjs)

caveat: requires switching to neovimAfter a trying out a lot of plugins I simply like the built-in the best (simply start typing a word and press CTRL-N or CTRL-P).

or CTRL-X + CTRL+L for Line completion

or CTRL-X + CTRL-F for File completion

For API's I use sth like https://devdocs.io (or local equivalent through CMD+Space on Mac)

For larger projects I use ripgrep (it's like awk and grep but combined, faster and better) and/or ctags from within vim to jump around code/patterns/function names/etc (using vim's built-in quickfix)";"I use [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) + [Tern](https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim) and they work perfectly for me. With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

    Plug 'ternjs/tern_for_vim', { 'for': 'javascript' }
    Plug 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'

Then enable it for JavaScript files:

    "" enhance YCM JS completion with tern's smarts
    autocmd FileType javascript setlocal omnifunc=tern#Complete

I also disable the YCM preview window:

    set completeopt-=preview
    
Then add a [`.tern-project`](https://github.com/ternjs/tern/issues/759) file at the root of each project (and/or in a parent directory) e.g.:

    {
        ""libs"": [

            ""jquery""

2017-08-28 06:57:06;Multiple CoC violations by Node.js board member Ashley Williams;"Locking this post, too much bad behavior and too many reports.Here and elsewhere, it's become more and more clear that what's happening is motivated by a Hegelian/Marxian ideology of thesis-antithesis power struggle.

One of the interesting results of this is that while a Code of Conduct regulates the speech and behavior of a community *explicitly*, behind that there is an *implicit* assumption of the power and worth of statements based upon which group the speaker belongs to: the thesis or the antithesis, that is, the dominant ideology or the secondary ideology.

A clear result of this, as we see illustrated here, is that an action or statement out of the mouth of speaker A is *not* weighed equally with the action or statement out of the mouth of speaker B.  This is why statements that are flipped to be equal and opposite are actually thought of to CoC enforcers as wildly different magnitudes of offense.  *What becomes acceptable and unacceptable according to the Code of Conduct becomes not so much what the actor says or how they act, but what group they belong to.*

For instance, if a member of the secondary ideology acts completely outrageously, they are treated with kid gloves because they are from the secondary/submissive ideology.  It's assumed that they are historically repressed - and that they haven't been able to have their say, so we should give them a pass, no matter how outrageous their conduct is.

Conversely, if a member of the dominant ideology acts even the least bit against the grain or even the least bit politically incorrect, the hammer comes down on them.  Through no choice of their own, they have been born into the dominant ideology and should tread as lightly as possible, so as to give others a chance.  The very smallest transgressions are seen as attempts to stifle the secondary ideology.

If you want to think of it kind of mathematically, you can think of it as a multiplying factor.

""How great is the offense of speaker A?"".  Because they're a member of the dominant ideology, the offense is the weight of the action/statement itself multiplied by 10.

""How great is the offense of speaker B?"".  Because they're a member of the secondary/submissive ideology, the offense is the weight of the action/statement itself multiplied by 0.1

EDIT: Thanks so much for the reddit gold!  First time I got it, in almost nine years.I'm a member of a protected class, and if Ashley's comments are any indication, I feel pretty unwelcome in the node/npm community right now.

In fact, my protected class is one that is notoriously discriminated against in the software industry.

I'm an Old Programmer.

It's funny, I see people asking, ""I just turned 30. Will I ever be able to get another job in the software business?""

Try being 65! ;-)

My work has created billions of dollars of value for multiple companies. But what's the good in that? I'm not young and hip.

And worse, I'm a white male.

Wait a minute... I'm not white, I'm Italian! (With a bit of Irish and French.)

Did you know that Italians used to be considered practically another race, like ""George Bailey's garlic eaters"" from [_It's a Wonderful Life_](http://www.italiansrus.com/articles/subs/wonderful_life_part3.htm)?

But never mind that, I'm still male, which obviously rules me out from ever speaking at one of these conferences. Which I don't want to anyway, so I guess we're good.

And anyway, who wants an old ""white"" guy like me around?

It even gets worse... I use **TABS**.It's truly sad that the platform that I once loved has turned out like this. It almost feels like a religious war with the CoC rules. I genuinely thought that programming was all about solving problems with code with no barrier to any race, gender, caste, culture, ethnicity, tribe or even a sentient being (machines come to mind). Clearly, that's not the case now and I'm just saddened that we've limited ourselves to CoC rules.

 Irony of ironies. Social justice advocates are fanning themselves silly [over this thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ohhoe/status/902258609911762944). People here aren't buying your double standards and damseling, socjus.

""This is what happens when a woman tries to...""

See, they can't stop doing it. Everything must be viewed through the lens of how your gender makes you a victim. But it's the _other_ people who are sexists, you know, the ones who don't act like women need to be treated with kid gloves, and who judge a woman by her output. Remember that catch phrase of theirs? ""Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences."" Not when it's these consequences, apparently.Ms. Williams sentiments and hate seem clear. She should have no part in Node JS moving forward, and neither should anyone else that publicly stands for racism or sexism of any kind.Here is a GitHub discussion thread regarding the board meeting that will be occurring on the Rod Vagg issue this afternoon:

https://github.com/nodejs/board/issues/69#issuecomment-325410716

And here is a respectful comment I submitted regarding the concerns that are outlined here concerning fellow board member Ashley Williams:

http://bitcubby.com/files/skitch/questions_to_the_board__following_yesterday_s_board_statement_·_Issue__69_·_nodejs_board_1F548F48.png

Hopefully they allow this message to remain visible.These comments are extremely unprofessional. This should definitely be addressed.if only these assholes would spend this time and mental energy making node better.

And I'm baffled by the fork to ayo.  Don't these people have clients and jobs with dependencies that require Node anyways?  Are they now forcing ayo on all of their future developers?I'm glad someone filed a CoC complaint on this matter. I realized from reading this Node.js Board of Director's (and NPM core commiter's) comments through the ayo.js thing that she couldn't care less if what she says affects me negatively, but the fact is that it does. I'm male and white. I grew up in foster care and group homes and have never felt like I fit in with professional / upper middle class people (of any race, orientation, or anything else). Not because they aren't nice people, or anything; I'm just excluded from the worries and experiences they share. I really struggle with thinking that I belong in a decent job doing software development, because I feel like such an outsider to the people around me. You don't know really what someone else's experience is, and people tend to assume a lot about others and their backgrounds.

I don't discriminate against others and I feel like I have a lot of empathy towards others. I am very generous to others, even to the point of my own detriment.

My escape from this world is tech. I started in ASM and C, and I've been infatuated with node the past couple of years because I enjoy some of the problems it's good at solving. But I *don't* at all have to stick around a community that's led by a bunch of asshats who think I'm not good enough to join their little party and who make a point of airing it publicly constantly, because I don't have the privileges they do; the world is real and unforgiving of mistakes in my life. It's also obvious to me that a lot of this is very manipulative and about furthering commercial interests of some of the people involved, or securing power in a project outside of the normal ways to do that (contribute good code!).

I'm watching how this plays out to decide if I want to spend much time around the node ecosystem going forward. It's enough taking shit from people badmouthing Javascript constantly without getting it from the inside too. There's enough work elsewhere, and maybe it's better work anyway.[deleted]This is a brilliant example of black knighting. Nothing is going to happen to Ashley. That's not the point. The point is this exposes CoCs for what they really are: a weapon for certain people to use against their enemies. It assists in ideological purges of undesirables but doesn't apply to those with the appropriate ideology. CoCs are a fraud, in other words.[deleted]Can someone show me where on a Pull Request, I can specify my weight, sexual orientation and religion?She sounds like a terrible person but I don't believe any action will be taken against her.No way action is taken here.  It includes actual citations.I'll be interested to see how this one plays out. Everything she's done seem like cheap, immature stunts to impress teenagers and ""totally like blow the minds of these old guys"". It's good to have someone outspoken about supporting women in tech but can't we get someone who's not just swinging blindly at anyone for publicity and spouting childish crap all over twitter? 

Where did they find this muppet?The report was received! https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/324This is giving me a sad, very sad smile :(

It just tells me that if you want to find something on someone you will find it.
And, if you want to enforce something that is important to you for a full 100% things will get hurt in the process.

At this moment the entire drama around Rod is not good for NodeJS and our community.
For me the hardest part is that I cannot find any real evidence (in the format as shown above) of what he is actually accused of.
It seems like i'm not alone in this according to [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15101668)

However, if 60% of the board has made a decision and you cannot live with it go ahead and make the fork and create your own playground. Maybe the NodeJS community is better of without them (once again not sure due to lack of evidence).
I hope the drama will end here and we can all do what we like to do most: Write code and make stuff better.

I'm all about inclusiveness and I really do believe toxic people should be removed from any community, but:

* Show structural evidence of toxic behavior
* Show any amount of forgiveness because I'm sure everyone has typed something that could be interpreted differently if you read it with a different mindset.

I hope this report will made people think about accusations and will help improve the process of reported CoC violations.

(edit: typos)
I sent the following email to report@nodejs.org:

I was subsequently banned.As a front end dev who subbed like a week ago. Damn, get your shit together Node community. Are they going to do anything because of this? Has anyone been actually removed from a leadership position in any open source foundation or project because of what they said on twitter?

Has she made such remarks in official node.js community spaces or events? Having an example of that would make a much stronger case. However unlike many others she doesn't specify that the tweets or opinions are her own and do not represent her employers/organizations and the same excuse was pushed in the attempt to remove Rod Vagg from his position.She is completely toxic to the community and need to removed completely. I quote RT'd something she tweeted (and later deleted). Her first instinct was to call me a dingdong. Exchanged some tweets where I remained about as polite as I could after that kind of initial response, ended up getting blocked.

Just to share my experience with this person, as some don't seem to be convinced about the issue yet.

p.p.s. this thread is transparent as fuck and we're literally all laughing at your sorry asses behind the scenes. Yes, Node folks are doing this.I wonder what would happen if people's concerns over the CoC is taken based on how much they have contributed to Node using some quality benchmark.

Would we even be having this conversation then?CoCs are utterly stupid. Live by the sword, die by the sword.I do agree that there is a pattern of infractions - and more importantly, a pattern of stereotyping and condescending comments towards men in general.

Though i would love to see more women participate in open source projects, and would love to see them in positions of influence, that can only come about if we choose participants based on the quality of their contributions and not on the loudness of their views.Ugghhh.

You're going to have to push hard to get any traction on this. They'll try to lump it in to the same timeframe/discussion and dismiss it based on this unilaterally written, yet reasonable sounding rule.This drama shit is why node will struggle to be taken seriously in enterprise. I wish this was posted somewhere public so I could share itHaha haha. Ha!


Haha haha!This structure is very reminiscent of CCP destabilizing and shaming tactics. No way you're a national is there? I'm going to make it clear that I don't find views against power dominant demographics to be ""racist"" or ""sexist,"" as those terms refer to actions that support larger societal biases. However, a ton of these messages are intentionally incendiary and not at all becoming of someone of her role. I'm a proud intersectional feminist, but there's a difference between bringing attention to social issues facing marginalized people and being an edgelord.

________

Also, I just want to highlight that a couple of these examples are pretty thin and I think distract from what I consider to be your focal argument:

> ""i get mad almost every day about how we sterilize male animals in the wild, but insist that human women take birth control not human men""

This doesn't read as a desire to sterilize men at all. She's talking about social expectation of women being responsible for birth control, which I think is a reasonable position to hold. The message regarding sterilization is only pointing out the dichotomy of having the expectation that male animals be sterilized, whereas female humans should take precautions for being effectively ""sterilized."" And trying to tie that to compulsory sterilization of POC is ridiculous and actually pretty fucked up. I would ditch that complaint.

> ""i am tired of and angry with @nodejs leadership. inclusive spaces are within your reach. at this point, it is clear you dont want them.""

How is this relevant to your CoC violations? There's nothing wrong with a board member questioning the leadership of the organization they're involved in and there's nothing really incendiary in here at all.A code of conduct was not designed for this kind of witch hunt and this is a witch hunt.

As a white tech dude, I do not feel horribly offended or threatened by this person's tweets.

In the current context of things, what I'm picking is basically a pissing contest.

Let 'em downvotes start.This is like fighting stupid with stupid.  It doesn't matter if she hates men or dogs or tuna casserole, people are allowed to have opinions.  But when a person becomes a problem in the workplace, like when they publicly go after a coworker because of some personal grudge, they need to be dealt with.This thread is a joke, right? You've searched for ""abuse"" and come up with this? 

Also, most of her recent comments regarding the TSC have been made by other white male peers who you haven't picked on. 

As a white man I'm truly embarrassed by most of the top comments in this thread. I wish those dudes were called Rod Wiggum and Ralph Vagg instead.Free speech should have some limits, but nobody should be restricted from making harmless comments such as the above. 

This ""Political Correctness"" nonsense has gone way too far.

> ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it""Feeling insecure as a white dudeI'm gonna be the dissenting voice here. This is literally the first time I've seen any of this drama, and my takeaway from these quotes is that this is about a billion times less bad than the misogynistic shit that real misogynists spout. A lot of this could be construed as sarcasm or hyperbole because it seems mixed in with a lot of shit that really isn't that bad.

Again, just an outsiders opinion.ah the old pointing out sexism & racism==sex & racism trope. Let me guess none of you even see color?From a fellow node-contributor and NPM author, and a non-whiny white dude, I stand by Ashely. These are baseless allegations,

> ""never underestimate the wrath of a mildly inconvenienced white dude (and yes it is all dudes complaining)""

You know how many white dudes left node because of that statement? 0. Precisely 0. She's exactly right and this post is evidence of it. You're mildly irritated; in the mean time, transfolks and women in software engineering are sexually harassed and belittled. The climate is made so unwelcoming that they just leave FOSS entirely.

> remember how you thought that white dudes conflating their opportunity with merit in tech was awful? literally the same thing in capitalism

That's also true. I'm a programmer because my dad struck gold moving to Texas and opening up a stereo store. It's privilege to start at a young age, not skill; and, it's a game that requires early admission. That's why India, Brazil, and China has emerged as a software powerhouse, their middle class can now afford to equip their children with computers.

All this whiny nonsense from other white guys that have no perspective on wordly problems. And, most of it is the predictable outcome of the failed attempt to get Rod Vagg removed.""Additionally, it is likely Ashley will be participating in an override vote on August 28, 2017 regarding the complaints filed against Rod Vagg.""

""Unfortunately, this is submitted anonymously due to the risk of becoming the target of dishonest slander, mis-characterization and harassment.""

Imagine how awful it is to have anecdotal tweets taken out of context and then posted online to discredit your position. Imagine when the purpose is to remove your right to vote out someone who violated the CoC on a heinous level.If you start off by claiming ""never underestimate the wrath of a mildly inconvenienced white dude (and yes it is all dudes complaining)"" is ""hateful speech towards 'white dudes'"" I'm gonna have a hard time taking your grievances seriously.

I mean, it's almost like you're proving your point for her, actually... seriously, just go back and re-read your assertion and you'll probably see the painful irony.

Speaking as a white dude, I'm always kind of ashamed by how we, as a group, behave in online spaces. We still dominate these spaces, and until we learn to make room for others it's pretty natural we catch some flak for it - that's not racism/sexism, that's not even ""reverse racism/sexism"" (which is not a thing, anymore than self-defense against an attacker is ""reverse murder""). It's just as preposterous as Trump's ""many sides"" gaffe - equating those who fight for white male supremacy and those who fight against it for ""both being racist/sexist"" is ridiculous. You can find more inflammatory comments in MLK's writings, for crying out loud!

Fellow white dudes, please, I'm begging you: let's be better than this. Let's recognize we're cheating others and ourselves by keeping up the big ""girlz keep out!"" sign on the treehouse door. We need to grow up, already! There's plenty of tech jobs for everyone, and our industry will be better with a fairer playing field. People always claim women in tech who don't like sexist harassment just need to ""toughen up"" or ""grow thicker skin"" - maybe it's the other way 'round, and it's us who needs to stop crying about ""reverse sexism"" just because we get called out for our fragility/defensiveness/complicity on sexism. It's not asking too much, is it?[deleted]This is fairly well trod ground at this point, but the reason Ashley can say these things is because they're completely harmless. We (I'm a white dude too), don't have our identity/demographic used against us. If you're being practical about this, what she's expressing in these tweets is only mildly socially unpleasant. By contrast, the monolith of presumption that women face *on an hourly basis* rules their entire lives, and their entire careers. This kind of eye-for-an-eye reasoning doesn't work because, realistically, the stakes are overwhelmingly asymmetric.

Yes, I think this kind of overt anger and frustration is counterproductive, but again, I'm a white guy and I have the privilege of being objective by virtue of being personally unaffected by the issues Ashley is reacting against.No such thing as sexism against men, what is wrong with all of you> trying to have a dialectic

tl;dr The TSC needs to vote again on whether to evict Rod Vagg and if the right result is not reached, the board will transfer CoC enforcement to someone else, possibly themselves.I would rather you just evict the SJW people and keep writing code.

I do not care about their politics and no one else should.

And mind my own business I did, until I heard this: “we use Yarn because it’s more deterministic than npm”. I gasped, but luckily was able to cover my mouth in time so I don’t think they noticed.

And then goes on to talk about how you don't need yarn.  The thing is, he's using npm5 to justify this position, but npm5 wasn't around for those ""months"" that rolled by.

npm5 attempts to address some of the issues that yarn fixed, but it took a long time getting here and that's why people were excited about yarn during those ""months.""

Having switched to yarn I'm not going to switch back, especially since it's still significantly faster for every project I have measured.I experienced many random issues over time. Then I personally switched to yarn when faced an issue with npm 5.3, see this https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/18340

Then when you start using yarn, you find out that's much more fast and reliable than npm.I love the YAT unit of measurement described in this article. That warrants its own post. A fun experiment would be to take apart popular open source projects and measure their YAT score.I'm having so many issues with npm 5 that it's unusable. I can't even get just a regular `npm install [packagename]` to work half the time. NPM 5 is completely broken right now. And fails to install on a lot of our projects. NPM 3 and Yarn work perfectly fine. Anecdotal evidence, I know. But this is why we still use Yarn.I must be using npm all wrong, because I never had any problems with it, including 5.x. It sure isn't very fast, but it kind of just works for me.Some things to remember about NPM at the time yarn came out.

* It was SLOOOOW. If you turned off progress bars it was slightly faster. But yarn was significantly faster.
* Shrinkwrap (the lockfile format at the time) was not intuitive and was not deterministic. If packages were listed in package.json and not in shrinkwrap.json it would install the extra packages.
* npm install would put dependencies in different locations depending on if you were initially adding the dependency (with an already existing node_modules folder) or doing a fresh install.
* Lifecycle scripts were broken almost the entire major version 3. Preinstall fired AFTER install, for instance.

There is less of a ""need"" to move to yarn nowadays with npm 5 but I think a lot of people moved to yarn and have not looked back. Yarn, in my experience, has introduced far less breaking changes since v0.16.0 (first lts release) than NPM. Early versions of NPM 5 simply did not work for me on many occasions, but that's just personal experience.

Yarn has recently added workspaces so there is potential for much nicer mono-repo support. There is also yarn create which allows you to build tooling similar to create-react-app.

But again if all you need to do is install dependencies reliably and quickly you are perfectly fine with either solution!

Competition has definitely helped both projects to continuously improve.";"I experienced many random issues over time. Then I personally switched to yarn when faced an issue with npm 5.3, see this https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/18340

2016-11-18 19:10:35;Vuex - why have mutations AND actions?;"You can call the mutation directly from a method in a Vue component.

`this.$store.commit('SOME_MUTATATION, options)`

Actions allow you to share async (remember, mutations have to be synchronous) methods throughout the app. This could include committing multiple mutations or pulling data from an ajax call.IMO it's mostly for readability, [Evan discusses it here.](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/236) Both actions and mutations indicate that the state will be changed, but you are making it explicitly clear to anyone reading your code that it is synchronous (commit) or asynchronous (dispatch).

It may feel clunky while writing, but code is read more often than it is written.Actions are only to be used for async things that affect your store (actions handle your AJAX calls and then use mutations to affect the state). This is very helpful when using the Vue DevTools as well because each commit on there has all necessary data (and doesn't have to make any AJAX requests to get the app to the proper state). 

If you are using actions as wrappers around mutations without the action doing an async job, then you're not using them properly and you should just use mutations.";"IMO it's mostly for readability, [Evan discusses it here.](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/236) Both actions and mutations indicate that the state will be changed, but you are making it explicitly clear to anyone reading your code that it is synchronous (commit) or asynchronous (dispatch).

Why don't you want to use nodejs for server side rendering, though? Just want to make sure you're aware of putting node in front of Laravel to solve this problem.
