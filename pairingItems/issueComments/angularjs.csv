2014-03-01 11:45:06;Who's broken, Chrome or Angular;"You're trying to do DOM manipulation in the post-linking function which won't work. By the time the post-link function runs, the DOM has already been constructed by Angular's compile phase. There's nothing wrong with manipulating the DOM in a directive, that's what they're explicitly for, actually. But to do that, you have to use the compile function instead of the link function. 

compile: function(tElement, tAttrs){
    angular.element(tElement).addClass('class');

return {
   link: //link code goes here
   };
};

Compile always returns an object of the link function and you no longer use the separate link function like in your example (Angular will just ignore it). If you need to access scope in the compile function (say to set a dynamic class based on controller data) you can't do that in compile, so instead you have to use a pre-link function in the returned object. Pre-link has access to scope and runs before the linkage phase, so it effectively works like compile. 

return {
   pre-link: function(scope, element, attrs){
     //you can manipulate DOM here with scope properties
    },
    post-link: function(scope, element, attrs){
    //mostly for attaching event listeners and things like that
    };

[This](http://www.sitepoint.com/practical-guide-angularjs-directives/) blog post helped me wrap my head around it. Sorry for the lack of formatting. I'm on my phone. 

Edit: I shouldn't say you can't manipulate the DOM in the post-link phase. You can, but it's mostly done on events like click and you have to run $apply to make sure that Angular passes the change out to the DOM. 
More likely you. :) Toss a default case into that switch (with a console.warn), or step debug it.I've just cloned your project, an immediate issue seems to be that the result variable is empty when I try to console.log it. 

Asides from that, the method you're employing isn't a particularly ""angular"" approach - it would be nicer to assign these classes to the elements via your markup, rather than in the directive itself.
Insert 4 whitespaces at the front of a line to format like code.

    angular.module('myApp') .directive('myBackground', function () {             
        return { restrict: 'A', link: function (scope, element, attrs) { 
            var result = getComputedStyle(element[0], ':after').content;
            result = result.replace(/""/g,''); //Because Firefox keeps quotes from content 

            switch (result) { 
                case ""phone"" : element.addClass(""bg-small""); 
                     break; 

                case ""tablet"" : element.addClass(""bg-medium""); 
                     break;
                
                case ""small-desktop"" : element.addClass(""bg-small-desktop"");
                     break; 

                case ""large-desktop"" : element.addClass(""bg-large-desktop""); 
                     break;
             }
        } 
    }; });**Solved!**

I found confirmation of my theory, a Chrome bug. Chrome is handling `getComputedStyle()` with considerable difficulty. If your pseudo-element is set to `display:none`, Chrome 33 Stable soils itself.

2014-09-18 20:28:36;[Help] How are you guys handling CSS/LESS when modularizing your code?;"This might sound crazy, but I think **module-specific CSS should not be coupled to the module**. A base framework CSS file (like Bootstrap, Foundation, or your own) should cover all basic styling for every app you build, and then you should write custom CSS (I keep mine in a public/scss/ folder, which I watch and compile with Grunt) for each app, which is kept separately from the Angular code, so that someone doesn't have to understand Angular architecture to work on the stylesheets.

The point here is to keep structural CSS (Bootstrap/Foundation) away from site-specific CSS which often expresses a specific brand or aesthetic style.

There are cases where re-usable components will need specific structural CSS — a calendar, a music player, etc. These should be implemented as **private bower components** that come with a base stylesheet (as minimal as possible, so you can override in your app-specific CSS).

So basically:

1. Most modules shouldn't need specific styling to function. Thus, keep the modules truly portable by not coupling them with CSS at all.

2. Any modules that _do_ need styling to function (usually related to positioning) you should implement as bower components. 

3. Any set-in-stone modules that you want to implement across projects should be turned into bower components anyway.I put a _foo.scss file in each module directory. Unfortunately, there's no good way to put it all together, so we just have a main.scss file that does @import ""foo/foo"" and so forth. The big issue is that if you have generics you're extending (e.g., compass etc) they'd get multiply imported if you had a lot of different sass files. Sass / Less both could use something similar to a linker, where you compile against a library but the libraries are lazy-loaded at runtime. But I digress.

So I end up with a top, application-level css file that contains all the child sass stuff. This helps with code organization more than anything else, because namespacing css isn't particularly easy anyway. Someday, webcomponents and shadow DOM will fix this.I include <link> elements inside my main templates. I then have a build process which inlines my templates and then inlines the CSS inside the template. It means that I occasionally get a flash of unstyled content when  testing but it doesn't happen after everything has been inlined. The build script isn't complicated, it's about 100 lines of JS.

That is how http://explore.plunker.co is built I think you would like atomify. It covers that and it's very simple. Don't use LESS but with SASS I just write it as a separate SCSS file and then include it in the main compile sheet.If you are following the ng-boilerplate style of bundling you LESS files together with your modules, rather than all in one central LESS directory, you can use the grunt plugin [grunt-less-imports](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/grunt-less-imports) to automatically compile all the LESS files.

I discovered this when I had the exact same question as the one you asked.

The build system is Grunt, so not necessarily ""really complex"", although I do think the ng-boilerplate gruntfile in particular is not the easiest to get your head around.If this doesn't quite make sense, think of something like Bootstrap's LESS file organize and the Angular adaptation - UI-Boostrap. There's no real association between the two. If you want any part of UI-Bootstrap you have to pull in the whole Boostrap CSS set. (That's just an example, not trying to start a discussion on Bootstrap/ui-bootstrap organization).

2015-05-22 06:33:46;This AngularJS modules/dependencies thing is a lie;"I've known this for so long now, that I've sort of forgotten that it can nail new people in the ass.

The last one registered with the name wins - which means you have to be mindful about how you name things, or prefix/namespace them.

The other issue that can happen, is once something is defined as a dependency somehow in your app - every other module can use it, even if it was not an explicit dependency.

    angular.module('a',['b','c'];
    angular.module('b',[]).factory('bFactory',function(cFactory) { });
    angular.module('c',[]).factory('cFactory',function() { });

When you run your app, module b can access cFactory, even though you never defined it as a module dependency.

However, when writing my unit tests - I'll only do a beforeEach(module('b')) - in which case, the unit test would blow up and fail about not knowing about cFactoryProvider. Helps keep me honest about keeping my module dependencies in check and being mindful about where I'm getting things from, even if when running as an app - that sort of goes out the window.


Well it will be gone soon anyway and we can do this:

    import {hello as hello1} from 'thirdParty1';
    import {hello as hello2} from 'thirdParty2';

and then just use hello1() hello2() without any DI

You can even do this now if you are using angular 1.4, you are transpiling your ES6 code and if each of the modules exports in the common fashion.We just realized this recently as well. As much as the title sounds click baity, I kind of agree. 

The whole module DI concept really leads one to feel like there is a scope provided for all objects but the reality seems that it is more of a global type of situation. My team recently ran into this issue with a couple popular libraries: https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/issues/521

2015-07-21 09:52:38;How do you handle SPA from a UI perspective?;"[deleted]I assume you are talking about having route ""resolve"" taking time and therefore causing the noticable delay. 

You could hook up on route changing/changed events and add some sort of minimally disruptive wait animation if the route change takes longer than about 160ms (what feels like instentaneous change). 

We've taken the road of not disabling input and not using wait animation, but instead adding transitions so we buy ourselves a little more time on resolves. Also we try to put as little as possible in resolves, and instead load data ""async"".

Hope it makes senseThis issue has a few solutions to show a loading bar during ui-router's resolve. This can probably be implemented using ngRouter aswell.

2.0 is way too bleeding edge atm to be used in production IMHO.hi.
if you choose to go with ng1 > 1.5, consider using ES6/ES2015 - thus, making the code almost ready for a move to ng2.

https://github.com/orizens/angular-es2015-styleguideI get asked this a lot and finally put an AMA up with some thoughts: https://github.com/toddmotto/ama/issues/8

Hope these help! :)I would lean strongly towards angular 2.

If this software needs to be enterprise-grade from the start, or you have more than just a few people working in it, or if the rest of your team isn't keen on using the cutting edge, then for sure you should stick to 1.5.

If none of the above applies, then angular 2 is right now capable of being the core of a large project and you shouldn't feel too wary of it. I've converted an app to 2 already and am pretty satisfied with it. I'd recommend trying it out. It's pretty decent for beta. As long as you have time to keep upgrading it through the release.It depends on your launch timescale and how critical it is if things are delayed due to hiccups.

I've been ""kicking the tires"" of Angular 2 and even though there are still some rough spots and pain points you can see the promise of it. It's forward looking and embracing the future of client-side development rather than sticking with the past. There are plans for server-side rendering, web-workers etc...

Sometimes there are some frustrations not least because the documentation and know-how hasn't been built up yet but given time that will come. I already feel more productive with v2 despite the learning curve and having used v1 for quite a while.

If you have no Angular know-how at all then I think it's a no-brainer - learn Angular 2 ... when did any old-version framework ever outlive the new version? (apart from Python 2 vs 3).";"I get asked this a lot and finally put an AMA up with some thoughts: https://github.com/toddmotto/ama/issues/8

2016-01-24 21:33:33;UI-Router 0.2.16 released;"Stay tuned.  We're excited about the future of UI-Router.  

We've re-architected and rewritten the guts of UI-Router.  The core code has been divorced from angular, and will be moving to a new repository.  

The angular1 platform specific code (an adapter) will continue to live at angular-ui/ui-router.  

We prototyped an angular2 adapter in less than a day!  We hope to release a preview of ui-router-ng2 within a month, and intend for a production release on or before Angular 2's production release.


We're actively working on getting another 1.0.0 alpha out the door for ng1.  In case you missed it, [1.0.0-alpha0](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/1.0.0alpha0) landed on new years day.


With the new UI-Router 1.0 architecture, creating adapters for other platforms (React, anyone?) should be fairly easy.  Long awaited and long overdue.

Try mapping another domain to it in your hosts file or using a public DNS -> localhost mapping like xip.io (127.0.0.1.xip.io) and you might find it just works.

You don't need to do anything special with Angular to use CORS - it already handles things correctly although you will read lots of blog posts and stack overflow replies that say otherwise (possibly about older versions).Like others have mentioned, a proxy server is the solution. If the owner of the service isn't going to enable CORS you need to set up a proxy server of your own that injects those headers in the response. 

You can set one up in node without too much difficulty. Others may know of an even simpler solution. You'll point your app to your proxy server instead of directly at the remote end points. You need to allow CORS on the server: [http://enable-cors.org/server.html](http://enable-cors.org/server.html)This isn't a client side issue, it can only be resolved through the server header configuration.

When profiling with the chrome devtools timeline I get

Version | JS time | Layout time
-------|-------|-----------
[Angular 1](http://plnkr.co/edit/PlN72d?p=preview) | 65 ms | 75 ms
[Angular 2 original](http://plnkr.co/edit/mJyjcH?p=preview) | 210 ms | 60 ms
[Angular 2 trackBy](http://plnkr.co/edit/mJw0dO?p=info) | 27 ms | 45 ms
Just a couple things:

Where have you heard that Angular 2 is Production ready? I'm not sure that's the case.

Also, you mention the most recent version being beta 3, but at the time of your positing the writing it's actually beta 6. In fact, you're using beta 6 in your example. Just simple corrections.

But I am really curious about that production thing. I haven't heard anywhere say that it's seriously ready for production.

edit: Here's the same scheme using RXJS Observables: http://pastebin.com/Vrrj25SN .. I'm not a pro, just working off what they teach you in the tutorials/guides + a simple observables tutorial. I have no means of testing it (crappy comp).Is it just me or should this code really have used the async pipe in combination with an observable that just keeps emitting new values?

That might provide preformance improvementsThis was proven the other day when it was pasted to the FB page the reason it's slower in this case is because the developer coded it wrong.. 

https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/7088I would love to see some commentary on this! Maybe its an Angular 2 problem, or the code could have been written in a more optimized way (for angular 2). 

Also have you tried bench marking each piece to see where the slow down occurs? 

Wonderful work by the way!I have an app currently in use in production that proved to be significantly faster in all ways. When I converted, I had to remove dozens of performance workarounds that were literally required for angular 1 to function with the amount of data I've got. After converting, I require none of the workarounds at all and it's actually still faster.

I suspect you've found a bug potentially, but I wouldn't call this some indication of overall performance loss.What do you think the results would have been had you utilized RxJS vs. setInterval, which I believe is the preferred way to handle these types of periodic events. 

Also, just thinking about the test scenario you propose.  10000 iterations in 50ms with random getting called 3 times, per iteration. That's a shit ton of operations. Honestly, I don't think that either of them are keeping up with that frequently a UI gets updated.  My guess is that Angular 2 is throttling this to keep things more efficient and lower burden on the UI.  

Some JS benchmarks would be helpful as well.  
Yes it is https://auth0.com/blog/2016/01/07/more-benchmarks-virtual-dom-vs-angular-12-vs-mithril-js-vs-the-rest/I am not that surprised.

I was blown away at the improvements.
I guess that VScode has a comparable autocomplete, but the one in WS is awesome. 

What also is fantastic is the auto import! You start writing the name of the object, and WS suggests all exported objects (first the local ones, then the node_modules). If you accept a suggestion it automatically adds an import line at the beginning of the file.

It also minimizes all the imports section to one line.Visual Studio is good in terms of feature, but if you are writing full javascript app (ex: nodejs/angular) using typescript, I found Visual Studio Code doing amazing job. I don't really find myself in need of these extra features the regular VS has and I love how light VSC is.I'm still a Sublime Text user. It requires some manual plugins (not different from VSC), but once setup it can be complete tool.Anyone been using WebStorm 2016.1 for TypeScript development? What has your experience been? New features look pretty nice, though I've not had a chance to play with it myself. Here's a couple of stats: 

VSCode 127Mb installed, project opens in 3seconds, 58 first level menu options

WebStorm 476Mb installed, project opens in 6 seconds, 179 first level menu options

I suppose that WebStorm does a lot more than VSCode, but VSCode seems to do everything that I want it to. I think Microsoft really nailed it when they decided what to have in out-of-the-box and what could be left to extensions. 

Personally, beyond editing the code itself most of my development activities are handled by a gulp file, so as long as my editor is gulp aware that makes it an IDE as far as I'm concerned.

WebStorm, in comparison, is carrying a lot of things that  I just don't need, for example : 'Toggle Temporary Line Breakpoint  Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F8'.

(context: express/angular, there's no way I'd use VSCode for .NET)You said VSC is an editor as opposed to a full-blown IDE like WebStorm; why is that?If you are not using Visual Studio Community 2015, you are doing it wrong. It has full angular and typescript support.

This release checkpoints the continued development of the 1.0 codebase, as we approach final release.  

### Notable additions in this release:

#### Packages

We are now publishing three separate packages using a new publishing architecture:

  - `ui-router-core`  (npm) framework agnostic core
  - `angular-ui-router` (npm and bower) angular 1
  - `ui-router-ng2` (npm; coming soon!) angular 2

The `ui-router-core` package is framework-agnostic.  Both ng1 and ng2 packages share the code in `ui-router-core` and provide viewport adapters to implement the `<ui-view>`.  Third parties could potentially depend on `ui-router-core` to implement ui-router adapter for any other framework.

#### Route to component

We now support routing to angular 1.5+ `.component()`s in two different ways.  We now put the resolved data on `$scope.$resolve` (or `$scope[controllerAs]$resolve`), so you can use [Components as route templates](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component#components-as-route-templates) in the same way as ngRoute.

We also now allow a state's view to be specified using `component: 'MyComponent'` in lieu of a controller+template.  We will map resolve data to the component's `bindings:` by name.

See the [component](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#component) and [bindings](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#bindings) for more information. 

We also support angular 1.3+ `.component()` with Todd Motto's [polyfill](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-component), and even support old school angular 1.2 directives (instead of `bindings: { foo: '<' }`, we will map to `scope: { foo: '=' }`).

#### View hooks (component/controller hooks)

For a long time, we've advocated using the state machine to manage application lifecycle.  However, using callbacks such as `onExit` can be challenging, since the answer to ""can I exit this state?"" often lives in the view.  We've introduced some view-level callbacks that can be used to integrate controller code with the transition pipeline.

The first view hook we've implemented is `uiCanExit()`.  This hook can be used much the same as the component router's `routerCanDeactivate`.  See  the [Ng1Controller docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uicanexit) for more information.  The `uiCanExit` view hook is simply  sugar for [adding a transition onBefore hook](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/blob/1.0.0-alpha.1/src/ng1/viewDirective.ts#L424-L427).

#### Dynamic params

Dynamic parameters (the replacement for `reloadOnSearch`) can be declared in a [params block in a state definition](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1statedeclaration.html#params) like so: `params; { fooParam: { dynamic: true } }`.  When a dynamic parameter changes, it does not cause the state to be reloaded.  A controller/component callback `uiOnParamsChanged` may be used to be notified of parameter changes.

See the [Ng1Controller docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uionparamsupdated) for details on the new callback.

#### Expose internal state object's API

We're now exposing the internal state objects via an undocumented API.  This can be useful for other library authors who need access to things like `.parent` or `.includes`.  This internal API is subject to change (it hasn't changed much so far), so be careful.  The internal api of an arbitrary state can be fetched like so:

    var normalState = $state.get('foo'); 
    var internalStateObject = normalState.$$state();  
    console.log(internalStateObject.parent.name);


### We will maintain a list of [Known BC from 0.2.x to 1.0 final](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2219) to help you upgrade to the 1.0 release.
Finally. We are using 1.5 components and getting the resolve to work was kinda awkward. 

Working on a ~4 month old application with Angular 1.5.x. I would like to upgrade from UI Router 0.2.15 to 1.0.0A but a bit concerned that this is ... well alpha. The app hasn't launched yet so I could do the upgrade without breaking production code but I'm not sure about bringing an alpha release into an app that will see release soon.

Dynamic parameters (the replacement for `reloadOnSearch`) can be declared in a [params block in a state definition](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1statedeclaration.html#params) like so: `params; { fooParam: { dynamic: true } }`.  When a dynamic parameter changes, it does not cause the state to be reloaded.  A controller/component callback `uiOnParamsChanged` may be used to be notified of parameter changes.

See the [Ng1Controller docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/1.0.0-alpha.1/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uionparamsupdated) for details on the new callback.

#### Expose internal state object's API

We're now exposing the internal state objects via an undocumented API.  This can be useful for other library authors who need access to things like `.parent` or `.includes`.  This internal API is subject to change (it hasn't changed much so far), so be careful.  The internal api of an arbitrary state can be fetched like so:

    var normalState = $state.get('foo'); 
    var internalStateObject = normalState.$$state();  
    console.log(internalStateObject.parent.name);


### We will maintain a list of [Known BC from 0.2.x to 1.0 final](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2219) to help you upgrade to the 1.0 release.

2016-03-27 15:17:45;ui-router update - Added support to routable components (Route a view to a directive using `component`);"That's great news! But how is it done? I read a [post by you](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2627) a few days ago and you had multiple options in mind. Which option did you settle for?So now I should refactor my standalone controllers to components and route to them instead?Here is my personal project (work in progress), that's already using it. New $state component definition is working as expected :)

https://github.com/PabloHidalgo/angularjs-1.5-components-showcase

Besides new component feature in state definition already working, you can check a full component based angular app architecture, based on dumb/smart components, data service communication, etc...any contribution is well received!Just started learning Angular. Somehow ended up using ui-router. Still not clear on features.

is there an ELI5 for Angular noobs?

2016-07-22 13:20:13;How do I wait for a modal dialog using Protractor?;"Hiii, Protractor works with promises you should write :

    it('Test modal dialog', function () {
        browser.get(mainPage);
        element(by.id(""addNewClient"")).click().then(function(){
            browser.wait(element(by.id(""newClientModal"")).isDisplayed, 5000);
        }).then(function(){
            element(by.id(""clientLastName"")).sendKeys('Smith');
        }).then(function(){
            ...
        });  
    });

wait, click, sendkeys are promises trust me you should wait them ;) else you gonna have fake fails.

If you are using a modal try to wait the backdrop ;)I'm not at home right now but when i get back i'll send you my solution. I had the same problem and i used this solution

    this.clickWhenClickable = function(element) {
        return browser.wait(function() {
        return element.click().then(
            function() {
                return true;
            },

            console.log('not clickable');
            return false;
        });
      });
    };

https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/1555If you're using ui.bootstrap or other similar libraries to generate the modal, there's an invisible ""backdrop"" div that's probably blocking your select input call. Try hiding that first before accessing content in the modal. ";"I'm not at home right now but when i get back i'll send you my solution. I had the same problem and i used this solution

We've got some additional features in ui-router 1.0.0-rc.1 (coming soon) that make route-to-component even better.

### & bindings

We are adding support for ""&"" bindings for component callbacks.  See https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/3111

    .state('foo', {
      component: 'foo',
      resolve: {

### wire bindings from parent state component

We are also adding the ability to wire bindings down from the parent state component to the child (using the ui-view).  See https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/3239

    .state('foo', { component: 'foo' })
    .state('foo.bar', { component: 'bar' })

2017-01-11 22:40:11;UI-Router 1.0.0-rc.1 released;"### The following list highlights the most notable changes in this release:

- Route-to-component
  - Now supports binding to a *child state component from the parent state's component* through the `ui-view` tag (for handling events from dumb components, etc)
  - Now supports `""&""` callback bindings to functions returned by resolves
- Url Rules subsystem overhauled
  - Now, the most relevant URL is matched, instead of the rule that was registered first https://github.com/ui-router/core/issues/15
- Query parameters no longer encode slashes as `~2F`
  - New param types: `path`, `query`, `hash`
- Hash parameter is cleared out on subsequent transitions (it is no longer an inherited param) 
- Use `{ location: 'replace' }` when a URL redirect occurs.  This eliminates the extra entry in the browser history.
- Create a new `UrlService` (`$urlService` and `$urlServiceProvider`).  This service is a facade which consolidates the most commonly used URL APIs.  The other URL apis still exist, but are marked as deprecated for public use.
- Typescript definitions (`.d.ts`) are now compatible with Typescript 1.8.x
- Implemented `NOWAIT` resolve policy (do not wait for promises; do not unwrap promises)
- `ui-sref`/`-active` 
  - Links update when states are added/removed
  - Params-only srefs work properly (only change params on the current state)
- ui-view
  - States without any views (template or component) get a template of `<ui-view></ui-view>` allowing easier creation of `abstract` states
- Use `$templateRequest` by default to fetch templates
- Lazy Load
  - More flexible lazy loading (lazy load anything: states, components, services -- whatever you need)
  - Imperative lazy loading (can be used to pre-load lazy states)
  - Bugfixes

2017-03-04 23:42:28;Lazy Loading with Webpack and Angular 1.x;"Unfortunately no. Once your app is bootstrapped there's no official support for registering a module with Angular in 1.x. ocLazyLoad works around this by registering all the components, services, etc. with the proper angular providers (e.g, a component with the $compileProvider), then running the config/run blocks of a module. This is very similar to what Angular does in the bootstrap phase. Future compiles and service injections will work as expected. I think it puts some wrappers around the angular window objects as well. 

If you want 1.x support, I'd recommend using ocLazyLoad. Lazy loading was [proposed](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/11015), but never completed for 1.x. Angular 2 has this ability [built in](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/modules/lazy-loading-module.html). I built a large app in Angular 1.x several years ago and had Lazy Loading in it. I don't have the code anymore (it was for a company), but I believe I derived it from [this post](http://ify.io/lazy-loading-in-angularjs/). I was not using Webpack, but it does use RequireJS, which you should be able to get working with Webpack.

Things to note about this way of lazy loading (and Angular2's lazy load, as well) is that they load code into memory and attach the new stuff to the existing app, but there is no way to UN-load those things. So, if you have a large app, it will take up more and more memory as things are lazy loaded.We are using it with out much headache. ";"Unfortunately no.
