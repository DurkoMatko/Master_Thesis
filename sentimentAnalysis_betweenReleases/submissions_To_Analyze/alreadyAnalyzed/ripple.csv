2013-09-04 16:58:13;Is there a place to spend ripples? what do you do with them?;"Anywhere you can spend bitcoins, you can spend XRP too (they are automatically traded to Bitstamp.BTC and then sent to the specified bitcoin address by Bitstamp atm).

I personally just keep the ones I got for free and wait, Ripple anyways is much more than its currency/asset XRP.You save most and use like 1% of your stash to seed other people duh :-)"
2013-09-16 17:43:12;Bitstamp's new verification requirements - How does this affect ripple withdrawals & btc payment?;"True, and neither is buying ripple XRP with USD or Bitcoin already in your Bitstamp account, or buying/selling from within the Ripple client (which is much cheaper for buying XRP).
However, getting the necessary documents to get verified is annoying. It shouldn't be hard to get a copy of your passport/ID card, but providing a proof of residence is difficult for me. I have a rent contract from 2009 which is still valid, and I don't get bills for this; I just send the sum of my rent money every month by bank transfer. But the proof of residence should be no more than 3 months old.
I also don't have any type of utility bill on my name as the house owner takes care of all this. I only have a mobile phone contract but it's probably not legally valid as a proof of residence. I've contacted customer support, hopefully we can get to an agreement, but right now I can't access my funds on Bitstamp which really sucks.Withdrawal from bitstamp to ripple needs verification. That's what customer support says. I don't think the bitcoin outbound bridge implemented by bitstamp (which allow you to send BTC to bitcoin address from ripple) will be affected in anyway though."

2013-10-08 14:22:18;Ripple Labs now taking cash payments following deal with ZipZap and SnapSwap;"Would be interesting to see, what the typical fee ends up being, if you use this to buy bitcoins. If I understand it correctly, you should be able to do this:

Get a Ripple wallet, open an account at SnapSwap (only US customers I believe), trust SnapSwapUSD for some amount. Use ZipZap to turn cash into SnapSwapUSD and have that sent to your Ripple wallet. Use the Ripple wallet to send SnapSwapUSD to a Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin bridge is currently provided by Bitstamp, which means this should automatically find a way to exchange SnapSwapUSD for BitstampBTC within Ripple (maybe going through XRP or a direct exchange) and then Bitstamp sends that out as actual bitcoins.

Looking at what is involved here, it is probably fairly expensive. But it's kind of a Ripple version of Bitinstant, I guess.

I imagine though, that the Bitstamp Bitcoin bridge will probably not be operating for much longer. With Bitstamp starting to require verification, it will soon prevent random people from acquiring BitstampBTC (not until they are verified with them), which means you can only use that Bridge, if you have a verified account at Bitstamp as well.This is badly worded. Ripple Labs in *not* taking cash payments at all. This is a deal between ZipZap and SnapSwap and they're using the Ripple payment system. (Although it's possible that Ripple Labs encouraged the deal or otherwise brought the companies together).Why is this getting downvotedZipzap and Snapswap? Come on! How can I take this seriously? Those sound like names created with the web 2.0 company name generator ( http://www.dotomator.com/web20.html ) . This whole thing (ripple) reeks of a scam. Not scamming the little guy, but milking VC for as much as it can."

2013-11-23 20:58:13;Just registered at ripple.com, any kind person out there who can spare me some XRPs?;I believe Bitstamp will still sell you XRP for USD. So if you deposit USD (or deposit BTC and sell it for USD) at Bitstamp, you can get your initial XRP from there.

2013-11-19 22:41:47;I know these are basic questions, but I haven't found clear answers, so please...;Basically, you must 'TRUST' a intermediary 'GATEWAY', you can then, deposit money into the gateway, then withdrawl money from the gateway to your ripple account.. you can then use ripple to trade that gateways 'TRUSTED Euro IOU' for a 'Trusted BTC IOU', then send the BTC to an external wallet.. hope that helps :-) Once you realize that your bank balance is nothing but an IOU ( unlike cash or coin ) AND you imagine that Ripple gateways are uninsured banks that use an open source payment network instead of some proprietary cartel network AND the payment network happens to have a non-IOU ie cash like digital asset called XRP through which all IOUs are inter-exchangeable THEN you'll begin to see the light :-)

2013-12-01 21:10:08;Question regarding converting usd to xrp in ripple.;"at the moment xrp-prices are going up and down madly. i guess it's because the bitcoin-price is doing so too.I don't know how that site merges the different USD:XRP order books in Ripple (or even if it does) how often they update or even what USD balance you actually had (USD/Bitstamp, USD/SnapSwap, etc) so it's hard to give you an exact answer.

However, for sake of discussion, lets assume that you have/had USD/SnapSwap.

Right now on the USD/SnapSwap:XRP order book you could get ~14.75 per USD/ss (or ~0.0678). On the USD/Bitstamp:XRP order book you could get ~16.51 XRP per USD/bs (or ~0.0605).

If you traded on the trade page you'd get just 147.5 for 10 USD/ss. On the convert page you also get *at least* that much. However, if the system can find any liquidity from USD/ss to USD/bs at <~11% then the convert page will find it and make a payment path like so:

    USD/you -> USD/ss -> USD/someone -> USD/bs -> XRP

If the USD/ss:USD/bs liquidity was 1:1 you could get as much as 165 XRP. However, last I looked the liquidity was at a cost of 3-8% so you might only get 157 XRP or so. Of course other paths could be found and used as well. That's why if you just want to take whatever the current best price is, you're better off checking the convert (or send) page in the client first.

You can use the [Ripple Info Tool](https://ripple.com/tools/info/) to find out what paths were used/tried on your payment transactions.Gotcha. Yeah I see the price just increased on coinmarketcap to .051. Another questions if anyone knows the answer. I'm trying to edit or add a trust to snapswap in xrp so I can get my bonus xrp but I keep getting this message: Sorry, an error occurred while granting. Make sure you are connected to the Internet and try again later. . Anyone know what gives?"

2013-11-30 18:17:09;How to buy XRPs (for newbies);"What do I do if I can't get verified by Bitstamp? Is there an easier way to get bitcoins into ripple?How can i get started with Ripple if I am from Singapore ? Coinbase only accepts US residents..The Bitstamp link you provided says, ""We have no Ripples available at the moment. Please try again later."" Are there any other places?Honest question here - a lot of what I've read about ripple says that it facilitates currency exchange (i.e. so that we don't have to go through 10 steps to convert USD to XRP).  What's the point of ripple if it's really working the way you describe?

Could some early Rippler start trusting XRP purchasers and make a new way to convert BTC to XRP with many fewer steps?

2013-11-30 04:43:34;Wtb - XRP for BTC. Or open to suggestions!;"If you have a working Ripple account, the easiest way is to trade for them directly through Ripple, by depositing BTC with a gateway then trading those for XRP. To get a Ripple account set up, you might need to buy a few XRP through Bitstamp or from somewhere else first.0. Sign up for Ripple
1. Sign up for Bitstamp
2. Sign up for Coinbase
3. Buy coin at Coinbase and transfer to your Bitstamp account
4. Seed your Ripple account by buying 72 XRPs https://www.bitstamp.net/market/xrp/
5. Withdraw coins into your Ripple account from your Bitstamp account
6. Use Convert tab to convert your BTC into XRP (best market rate guaranteed)
7. Use Trade tab to set up limit buy/sell orders (advanced)
8. Redeem coins or USD back into Bitstamp by doing Deposit -> Ripple in Bitstampfor whatever reason... i got nothing at all from running BOINC all day today. Like zero's on all the stats. I definitely  was running for about 20 hours so I should have hit at least giveaway mark (they run every 12 hours)if you have BTC, you can do it pretty easily at Kraken.

1.  Create a Kraken account (5 seconds)
2.  Verify at least to Tier1 (5 seconds)
3.  Deposit Bitcoin (6 confirmations)
4.  Buy XBT/XRP (1 second)
5.  Withdraw XRP, or leave it there. (1 second)Thanks for all the help, I ended up using RippleWise and bought some with a bit of BTC. I only bought about 300, and am hoping to buy the rest within Ripple (to avoid the markup of RippleWise).

Are these my next steps?:
-Send some BTC to my Ripple Wallet.
-Transfer BTC to Ripple.

Do I need to know someone who has Ripple to sell? Or is there a marketplace there?

Thanks!"
2013-12-08 07:28:49;Anyone gotten SnapSwap xrp giveaway to work?;"Literally was going to post the same thing.  Deposited $10 earlier this week, the $10 came through into my ripple wallet no problems (after I added trust to SnapSwap).  But the 500 xrp never came through.

UPDATE: According to their [twitter] (https://twitter.com/SnapSwap) the XRP giveaway should come through by Monday 12/09, supposedly.They are feeling VERY scammy at this point.
It's been 3 weeks since I should have my bonus.
They probably could have manually paid out everyone's bonus by now.
I will NOT putting anymore money into Ripple if SnapSwap is how I have to do it... bonus or not.I just got my 500xrp from SnapSwap. I also haven't gotten the bonus yet. Emailed support no response so I called the number listed on the web site and was told that there was a problem with the bonus giveaway system but would get it not to worry. I was told my bonus would be given on Monday as they had issues with their bonus system. It's been since before Thanksgiving that I first added money.I did a ""top up"" of $20 USD about three weeks ago and got my 500 xrp a few days later, and then the 20 USD the next day. Same problem here. Got 800 bonus xrps to receive from them and nothing yet. I sent them an email, they didn't even read it and just sent me this generic form with stuff that had nothing to do with my problem.I still haven't gotten my bonus. Has anyone else?I got my 500 XRP from them 1 day after I got my $10 transferred over from them. I did email them in advance and right after I saw the $10 transfer. They said it could take up to 2 weeks, but like I wrote above, I received my 500 XRP the next day. 

It did seem kind of ""scammy"" since I had to open up my Ripple wallet to them as a trusted source, but I got my XRP."

2013-12-06 01:09:02;Do ripple wallets have 2 factor authentication?;"2FA is absolutely critical to prevent key loggers in malware etc. In many ways it's a complete joke this hasn't been prioritised. How do you think many have lost many BTC from those wallets. Also, isn't Payward who host the client the same Payward as in run the Kraken exchange that has very nicely done 2FA??Client side JavaScript can probably neutralize vast majority of key loggers by emulating and remembering to forget random keystrokesThis has been addressed multiple times on the forums. In essence:   
2FA does not make much sense right now, as you are the only person in posession of your key.

It is a popular gimmic to make people feel more safe though, so they said they'll add it to the client somehow (I am still not sure how to do this in a meaningful way, maybe with something like ""multisig"" in the bitcoin world?). No timeframe given.Also, you can't even change your password in the ripple client- you have to open a new client account and then transfer all your funds/ contacts/ ious to that minus the minimum XRP amount you have to loose for the privilege Peercover now has 2 factor and hosts wallets."
2013-12-05 16:19:48;Do I understand Ripple correctly?;"Kind of, sort of but not really. ;-)

XRP is the native (crypto) currency on the Ripple network, which is used for securing the network against spam transactions. XRP is the only currency in the Ripple network that has no counter-party risk; if you want to transact with someone and you can't agree on a currency (dollars, euros, pesos, whatever), you can always transact in XRP.

Also, you can send and recieve XRP from anyone without a pre-existing trust relationship.

BTW, XRP aren't worthless; they've increased in value quite a lot; so much that Ripple Labs is suggesting a [reduction in the amount of XRP required to activate an account and to create trust lines and offers](https://ripple.com/blog/proposed-change-to-ripple-reserve-requirement-2/). As I write this, 1 XRP is worth $0.0769 on SnapSwap and $0.0511 on Bitstamp. Two months ago, 1 XRP was worth $0.0125.

There are two gateways (Bitstamp and SnapSwap) that you can create accounts on and extend trust to that can hold IOUs denominated in USD for you.

Ripple also has a distributed currency exchange built-in—if you have XRP, you can convert it to BTC by essentially making a payment to yourself—you'll get the best price availabe at that time.

Or you can trade currencies and get access to the order book on the Ripple network."

2013-12-14 04:15:09;Why do you people think Ripple can be more widely used than BTC?;"One thing worth pointing out is that Ripple's consensus mechanism is ""better"" than Bitcoin's proof-of-work. Transactions are confirmed and irreversible in seconds, and there's no need to burn electricity for it. Bitcoin actually feels a little slow and clunky compared to Ripple.

(However, Ripple hasn't been as thoroughly tested as Bitcoin, so it's not quite certain that it provides the same level of security and irreversibility.)

(And the greater efficiency has a real effect, because it means the network is cheaper to support: transaction costs are much cheaper than Bitcoin, and there's no XRP supply inflation comparable to the inflation by block rewards.)[deleted]I'm not sure it will. The current service-providers/gateways seem to me like more or less hobby-projects - no credit history, regulation or reputation - and i don't want to be an unsecured creditor of some random llc. Unless some established financial institutions get involved, i'm not willing to use it for more than lunch-money. 

The recent patent-filing of JP Morgan may be a hint that they will do something of their own rather than rely on grassroots-projects like Ripple or Bitcoins. Historically, industry-wide initatives such as foreign exchange trading systems, or CLS Bank for currency netting and settlement, have often been started as bank consortiums, some of which are now privately held. I would guess if the industry comes to the conclusion that something like Ripple is needed, they would do the same - in a way compatible with current banking regulation (anti money laundring, know-your-client rules, client money trust rules and so on). Just acting as a Ripple-gateway right now would be too much regulatory and reputational risk for them.Beats me, it's a premined, centralized, built by a business to make a few early developers rich, scam.Ripple has some great features but I think with all the different exchanging going on it will run into more legal problems than even bitcoin would. Maybe?[deleted]Ripple has no future with SnapSwap running their exchange. It's been 3 weeks since I was promised a signup bonus. They are a joke."
2013-12-12 17:36:34;Different gateways provide different prices for XRP. Anyone know the best one? or why Bitstamp prices are so high?;"It's usually cheaper to buy using Ripple's internal trading system. If you buy directly from the gateways they charge a premium.

If you can't use Ripple's internal trading system because you don't have an activated account, you should probably only get enough to activate your account, and then trade internally for the rest.http://xrpvalue.com

This shows the value of XRP in USD/Bitstamp and USD/SnapSwap on the internal market – these can differ because IOUs from different issuers can't be directly interchanged. It's probably fair to treat this as an estimate of how the market values USD/Bitstamp and USD/SnapSwap relative to one another. The values when I checked gave an implied value of 1 USD/SnapSwap at between 0.836 and 0.963 USD/Bitstamp. I believe this is where the discrepancy between your first three numbers comes from.

The final number is because Bitstamp.com is a broker for XRP instead of an exchange – they will quote whatever price is convenient for them, which is typically worse than the best deal you can find elsewhere. I hadn't realized their prices were so much higher than market, though..."

2013-12-27 23:15:34;Can someone please inform me of the differences between ripple, bitcoin, and dogecoin?;"Bitcoin and Dogecoin are essentially the same – Dogecoin changes the branding and tweaks the parameters of bitcoin a little.

Ripple has many differences. Both Ripple and Bitcoin use a global ledger of all balances (in Bitcoin this is called the blockchain). Bitcoin ensures that this is trustworthy using a mechanism called proof of work, and Ripple uses consensus. Consensus is a much faster, more efficient system: transactions are irreversible in seconds, and transaction costs are much, much lower. (Ripple is thus suitable for micropayments.)

While Bitcoin consists only of a currency, Ripple has three parts: a currency called ripples or XRP which has a lot in common with bitcoins (fixed supply, no counterparty risk, etc.), a system for tracking balances between accounts (denominated however you like), and a distributed exchange.

The system for tracking balances or debts between accounts is flexible and has a lot of possibilities, but the use that's promoted the most is the ""gateway"" model. In this model, you form a relationship with an entity called a gateway which holds real world currency for you, and issues you corresponding transferrable Ripple balances. Using these as a substitute for cash lets you use the Ripple network to send and receive payments in any currency you wish.

Finally, the exchange allows you to trade XRP and any sort of Ripple balance. This gives something the Bitcoin community has wanted for a long time – a distributed Bitcoin exchange – and also is used behind the scenes in Ripple to make transactions currency agnostic. When you make a payment of 5 USD to somebody in Ripple, Ripple will give you the option to pay with any currency you have in your Ripple account – USD, XRP, BTC, whatever – and will trade that for the destination currency automatically.

It's also good at integrating with other payment systems. You can use the Bitcoin bridge operated by Bitstamp to make payments to Bitcoin addresses directly from the Ripple client, in the same currency agnostic way. (Your Ripple balances will be traded for bitcoins, then sent to the destination.)Bitcoin is the first decentralised virtual crypto currency. Dogecoin is just a copy of bitcoin created as a parody for all the other bitcoin copies (Litecoin, feathercoin etc).

Ripple is a centralised system with its own currency XRP. XRP is not mined like bitcoin and is only hard to obtain because its creators keep most for themselves. 

Ripple is faster, can handle multiple currencies, does automatic exchange between currencies (Bitcoin, Dollars, XRP etc.). And XRP is mainly used as an anti-spam measurement for the ripple network. Some XRP gets destroyed for every transaction. 

But Ripple is not as open as they claim. The server side source code still hasn't been released. (Edit:) And ripple is based upon trust, lots of trust. Gateways can screw you and actually disappear with your money. Unlike Bitcoin which doesn't need any real life trust on people/businesses to work by itself. You only need to trust the software which is actually open source. 

The short answer is that dogecoin is a joke in more ways than one, bitcoin's got great traction but it can be slow (by design), and ripple is really a protocol that just so happens to have a currency along for the ride.

To put it into a sentence, you can use ripple to trade in bitcoins while laughing at dogecoin.  You can also use ripple to trade in XRP, but they don't have traction yet as a currency... and as I'm learning they're not trivial to get a hold ofYou can read about Ripple [here](https://ripple.com/guide-to-getting-xrp-and-activating-your-ripple-account/).

2014-01-04 11:55:50;How profitable is WCG and Ripple?;"I only started mining at the end of November so keep that in mind.

I have an i7 860 running at 2.8ghz nearly 24/7 only off when I'm using my CPU heavily elsewhere (gaming, lots of multitasking, etc.) My settings in BOINC: 75% of processors, 50% CPU time. Average CPU temperature of about 80C (seems rather high, I know, but this CPU has a higher temp threshold than most. I could probably knock 5C off that if I redid my heatsink and fans but I'm not too concerned.)

I had some days, especially when I first started, that I'd get upwards of 150 XRP but now only 40-60 per day. I believe it's because so many more people are getting into this. :)

I've always had my computer running anyways so the extra electricity from a loaded CPU is small enough ($4 or 5 more a month) that I'm able to make a profit even at current prices. 

Hope that helped!there's [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Au0H1GyGhfkWdG0ybDQ0OGViZEFzeUFfTHo1MXFhdUE&amp;amp;output=html) that shows the WCG/XRP ratio, but has a 24hr delay. 

if i'm not mistaking they take the numbers from [here](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=0QGNJ4D832) and [here](http://www.computingforgood.org/) [deleted]You can use your GPU if there are projects that support it, but the last project to support it stopped new GPU work so there isn't anything for your GPU to do.

Just CPU for the time being.With my i lame ass Core2Duo CPU i got like 0.7 XRP per hour. I guess the energy used did easily outweigh the XRP gain at current prices.iMac 21' 2010 100% CPU 24/7 earned only 35 XRP today. It used to earn about 70 XRP per day.The income from BOINC and WCG is a tiny fraction above your cost of power, at least in California.  I've tried cloud computing and building cheap rigs; neither of which really yielded well.  I tried pitching to a friend who's currently mining EarthCoin (EAC) and he said he was making much more mining EAC than he was diverting *just his CPU power* to WCG.  I've even tried making bargain-basement rigs with high compute/ram and nothing else, but the repayment rate was far too high to be worthwhile.

Doing BOINC work with spare cycles is ok but anything else just isn't worth it.  Seems like the Ripple Team could really make a splash if they paid out enough to be competitive with Scrypt mining.Yes you can use your GPU with WCG, it *crunches* (we don't use the word *mining* in the BOINC community) much faster than CPUs.

You won't generate a lot of XRP with just a few tasks. I'm willing to trade BTC or LTC against my XRP with you to get you started with Ripple if you need.

As in investing in the company itself?I use ripple fairly regularly as a way of exchanging between different cryptocurrencies, but I don't have much XRP. Is that what you mean?Ripple is an Open Source software system and distributed ledger - you maybe can invest in RippleLabs, the company that builds this software, though their business model seems (at least from an external viewpoint, haven't seen their investor's pitch) to rely heavily on XRP as well however.

I doubt that they are looking for someone who wants to throw 100 USD at them, if you are a serious investor though, maybe get in contact with them.The Ripple system and XRP are inextricably linked.  [(See ripple primer for background on XRP)](https://ripple.com/ripple_primer.pdf)

You can find differing opinions on this, but I believe there's no way for Ripple (the system) to gain widespread adoption without XRP rising in value.  

As the number of users grows, even if people don't want to use XRP to transact, there will be demand for XRP through [reserve requirements](https://ripple.com/wiki/Reserves).

Investing in ripple and investing in xrp are the same. Ripple gets paid when xrp appreciates. "

2014-01-18 07:52:27;Ripple vs litecoin;"That is indeed the *advertised* purpose of Litecoin, believe what you may. Ripple is strongest as a federated debt-based payment system, which is perfect if you have trust, it is regulated, and large institutions back it, not so much otherwise. Ripple is a perfect example of government 2.0, the way it should be done. It could replace SWIFT, not bitcoin.

No matter how useful Ripple becomes in its own right, value-based coins like Bitcoin and Litecoin will always have their following. It is through that competition that decentralization gets its value. More altcoins, more federated payment methods.since a lot of the litecoin community is there just because there were no scrypt-asic until now, i think a lot of them will move again to some other coin, maybe ripple? idk

i dislike the centrality of ripple and that the infrastructure is held by a big company, but since you can mine ripple and change them instant to another crypto currency, maybe a lot of the LTC miners will switch once the asic's kicked the gpu's out of the game there? ;P"

2014-01-26 12:15:33;Can someone convince me...;"Ripple was my first dabble into cryptocurrencies. I ""bought in"" at the end of November by devoting CPU power to the World Community Grid, a project run on the BOINC client (http://boinc.berkeley.edu/). Since then I've earned about 2100 XRP, the native currency of Ripple. I have yet to put in a dime of my own money yet, although there are more and more options for doing so popping up that are entering the realm of ""consumer friendly"" and I certainly intend to do so in the future. I have done some trading on the market built into the Ripple wallet and been able to profit, but more on that later.

Now, you're gonna hear people calling Ripple a scam and most of that accusation comes from XRP being ""pre-mined"" and that seems to hold a bad connotation in most Bitcoin based mindsets. XRP is not a mined currency like bitcoin though; it is math based. Yes, you can currently ""mine"" XRP like I was saying earlier, but it's not mining in the traditional sense. Ripple Labs will be giving away 50 billion XRP (50% of total) to the public in a myriad of ways, one of which is Computing for Good (https://www.computingforgood.org/) which rewards people XRP for donating CPU power to good causes. Ripple Labs has already given away about 57 million XRP since November 28th in this way alone. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Au0H1GyGhfkWdG0ybDQ0OGViZEFzeUFfTHo1MXFhdUE&amp;amp;output=html)

XRP, as designed, is intended solely as an anti ledger spam measure that might have some other cool purposes if the price is able to stay steady and consistent. Each time you change the ledger (effectively every time you do almost anything on the Ripple network) a ""dust"" amount of XRP are destroyed. We're talking .0001 of a ripple right now though which is miniscule, but effective enough to make ledger spam too costly to be dangerous to the network.  There were 100 billion XRP created in the original ledger by the founding company OpenCoin who in turn gave 80 billion XRP to Ripple Labs. Ripple Labs intends to distribute 50 billion of those XRP to the public like I was saying earlier with giveaways and keep 30 billion for themselves to fund their own projects like expanding the network, and funding investors to get started, etc. (https://ripple.com/wiki/Introduction_to_Ripple_for_Bitcoiners)

This whole concept can indeed seem like a scam at a glance. You can say it's shady that the founding company held 20% of the original XRP, but they did start it all, which was a massive undertaking spanning several years back before Bitcoin was even a thing and costing millions. Doesn't that merit some sort of compensation?

You might think it's a scam because Ripple Labs could just sell its holdings at any time leaving the whole system shattered. But why would they? If Ripple Labs does as it says it will, the system could work wonderfully and it's easy to trust these companies if you believe in the Ripple system itself and what it can do. It doesn't make sense for them to ""sell out"" for a quick buck when they have something as innovative as they do. The potential is just too fantastic.

XRP will never replace bitcoin by any means, because it's not intended to! But I do believe the Ripple system will find a place amongst top cryptocurrencies for the long run and you should at least read up more on how it all works and keep an eye on it. 

In the short run, XRP will be used like every other coin currently to speculate so the price will continue to be driven around until hopefully it stabilizes out sometime in the not too distant future and can become something of a ""central currency"" to exchange any currency into anything else at equal rates as well as an anti ledger spam measure.

Lastly, back to the built in Orderbook on Ripple. I really like it so far. It's fairly simple to use and was my introduction to the realm of exchanges. There's a latency floor of 2-5 seconds, so high frequency trading is all but abolished making it easier for ""casual"" speculators to profit. There's been funny moments where you could cross market trade, for example USD/XRP/BTC, and make a profit, but in the grand scheme of things that isn't how the Orderbook should work. It's intended to be a way to trade any one currency into any other currency for nominal fees quickly and with great versatility through decentralized gateways. But right now speculation is rampant and the market is great for day trading due to the constant waves of really small up and downs in price. So if that's your thing check it out.

Well I wrote a novel, sorry about that, and I haven't even really gotten into what the Ripple system could DO in the future so you're gonna have to read up on your own if you want. I really believe the Ripple network will be a positive thing for the future of all cryptocurrencies.

P.S. Also keep a lookout for OpenTransactions, a protocol similar to Ripple with great potential but much further behind in terms of development. If Ripple Labs keeps on chugging along as it's been though and becomes widely accepted first, it'll be hard to overtake. It sounds like you just want something to speculate in. If so XRP is probably not for you (IMO). Speculation can be done with Ripple but that's not what Ripple is for. Ripple is not XRP.Hey Doge,

I'm not sure how that can happen without you sending DOGs out.  
If you did send some, but not too him, that implies some ""rippling"" took place, where the ripple servers decided that since that guy trusted you, it was completely okay to silently swap some of his DOG:peercover for your DOGs.It means some random strangers have given you a generous gift. It's as if someone gave you $10 with a note that says ""hold this for me"". They did so by accident, however, and hopefully they will fix it on their end.

2014-02-16 05:44:02;Have some newbie questions about ripple!;"1. XRP as a currency isn't too spectacular (it is pretty cool though), the really big thing is the Ripple protocol itself. Ripple and ripples (XRP) are different things. At a very basic level you can think of XRP as tokens to operate the Ripple system. That being said you're asking the wrong question. It should be ""What does Ripple bring to the table that hasn't been done before?"" They've created a distributed database based on trust and capable of handling complex scripts. It's overall potential still hasn't been fully realized, but right now the payment system is pretty remarkable and new. It allows anything of value to be traded near instantly, including Bitcoin or any other coin that comes along. It can also be used even in its current state as a really smart payment processor that's able to accept any currency for any other currency with very small fees (like fractions of an XRP.)

2. I might have to have someone comb this answer and correct me if need be, but the market cap is so big because 100 billion XRP were created with the original ledger. No more will ever be created. People call this ""premined"" but in reality it's not a blockchain based currency and isn't intended to be mined. Ripple Labs is giving away XRP fairly (so far this is true but people are still worried Ripple Labs will sell out for a quick buck leaving us all high and dry. I don't believe this and I'll explain at the end.) Because all XRP are already in existence it inflates the market cap. Like I said though, if someone has a better explanation, I'd love to hear it too. I haven't really looked much into this.

3. Inflated market cap from before? It's true it seems Ripple has really low volume compared to the big exchanges, I figure it's just low adoption rate right now, but again I'd love a detailed explanation here too. :) I use Ripple almost exclusively besides Coinbase.

4. Here's a cool part. The Bitcoin Bridge, which is run by Bitstamp, allows you to buy anything you can buy BTC with with any currency in your Ripple wallet, without a trust line, and with one click. It doesn't really make sense right now for places to accept XRP itself. Maybe that'll change, but XRP isn't really considered a currency. More a commodity.

5. Let's see, Ripple so far has been my only venture into digital currency. It's pretty much been all I need besides cold wallets and Coinbase. I started with computingforgood.org which allows you to dedicate CPU time to the World Community Grid project on the BOINC client in exchange for XRP. It's not mining in the traditional sense, it's a giveaway run by a third party. I like knowing my CPU is helping scientists do good work and I probably never would have even heard of BOINC without Ripple. Since I've started I've learned as much as I can about Ripple and I'm learning more every day. I've been treating it as an educational experience and so far haven't put any of my own money into it, but even so I've managed to take the XRP I got over about 2 months and diversify into 6 different currencies, including bitcoin of course, and I even purchased my first stock ever yesterday using just the Ripple client itself. In the future, we'll see smart contracts which will enable a myriad of awesome things like auctions, escrow, etc. Who knows? Ripple has the potential to replace Ebay and Paypal in one fell swoop. I'm sure anything like that is still far off if it ever does happen.

I can really see a bright, profitable future for Ripple, and I think Ripple Labs does too. That's enough reason for me to trust that they'll keep to their word instead of selling out. It's still wise to be wary of anyone in this new age of currency especially a corporation, but so far Ripple Labs has done nothing to set off alarms for me and I don't mind that they are trying to make money. This is capitalism after all. Eventually Ripple Labs will have as much control over Ripple as you or me.

Any other questions? :)"
2014-02-15 14:17:18;Paypal AND eBay could be replaced using Ripple;It really is awesome to imagine just what Ripple might become in the future if it succeeds. I just bought my first stock ever on Peercover today. It's the only stock available so far and it's for Peercover itself, but still it's a first for a digital currency platform. I could easily see an eBay type situation occurring after auction functionality is added.
2014-02-15 11:54:29;Hey, I'm new here! Best places to buy Ripple with BTC?;"You seem to confuse ""Ripple"" (the decentralized marketplace) with ""ripples"" (XRP, the native asset on Ripple).

You need less than 0.001 BTC worth of the latter at current prices to use Ripple and you can trade anything there really.

That being said, if you are still more interested in buying XRP, you need someone to hold your BTC for you (on Cryptsy that would be Cryptsy themselves). This is called ""gateway"" in Ripple. Some that are already relatively established and accept BTC deposits/withdrawals as well as having relatively large order books against XRP are DividendRippler, Bitstamp and Peercover.

Start by reading https://ripple.com/how-ripple-works/ and then move on exploring the few things that are unique to Ripple - gateways, trust lines and rippling. These 3 are key concepts not found in other cryptos, so make sure you understand them very well

If you are technical, here's a great video on how the distributed consensus works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1QVb1vlC0

Finally if you can read source code, visit https://github.com/ripple and nock yourself out. IMHO Ripple is the most open source crypto to date. On only are their wallet & server open source but so are their websites. For example you can see the implementation of http://www.ripplecharts.com at https://github.com/ripple/ripplecharts-frontend

Edit: and please make sure you backup your account key (not just the wallet's username/password). If you lose your crypto settings store (which is possible, however unlikely, and could happen entirely on server side)m the account key is your only recourse of getting your funds backThe neatness kicked in when someone created JED coin on XRPTalk.org and I trusted to receive them and boom!

In the meantime though.. that's a good question.  I guess you could create a new Ripple account & send your funds to the new account, in the case you no longer trust the security of your current account?

Some of this lax security bothers me too, seems like any sort of malware capturing your keystrokes would easily get your non-changeable Ripple pw with the current implementation.  Or possibly copying the browser instance (though hopefully the Ripple wallet is safe against that attack vector?).http://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/1z6ord/guys_i_like_this_ripple_wallet/cfr8jmi

Once that's in place, you would set up a new account key, then disable the master key, and make sure the new key was only stored with a new username/password, and never the old.

> If my account is compromised, doesn't that mean, the accounts of everyone who trust me are too..

Not exactly, but yes. Someone who controls your account can issue themselves unlimited IOUs in your name, and then take every trade offer for your IOUs (and use up any rippling liquidity). At that point you would likely be unable to honor all your IOUs. But the attacker couldn't do anything more serious to the accounts of those who trust you, so they're not exactly ""compromised"".

The situation is very much like holding money with any third party. You are not only trusting them to be honest, but trusting their security."

2014-03-16 18:50:25;A little rant on IOUs;"To summarize your points:
-Anyone can create an IOU denominated in any currency (eg BTC) in Ripple. 
-This is objectionable because the IOU may not represent an actual asset. 

My comments:
This is true except for the ""objectionable"" part since an IOU will not always be I backed. 

A good analogy is Starbucks coupons:
Starbucks may give you a $5 coupon for your next order. You expect Starbucks to honor this value. If Starbucks doesn't, it will be reducing your trust in Starbucks. This is why Starbucks honors these IOUs. 

This is called counterparty risk, whereby Starbucks is the counterparty expected to honor these IOUs (like a bank is expected to give you cash where you draw from your checking account). 

Same on ripple: you are expected to know and trust the counterparties who issue you IOUs / balances that the balance is backed by a real asset. 

Remember when MTGOX said it had the assets when it didn't? Obviously the block chain didn't help prevent this. 

That said, the reality of counterparty risk when dealing with balances on ripple is the same as bitcoin, Starbucks, Citibank, whatever: you as the balance-holder are responsible for estimating this risk, and are always susceptible to bad actors. Ok, to make it clear. I want the CLEAR separation of IOUs generated inside ripple by a ripple user from those generated by a gateway. ANY user can generate and IOU and call it a coin, you only need a couple of wallets to do that, it is all explained on the wiki. Most new to ripple do not understand that and when they see a new 'coin' they think of it as a crypto coin that is new and they think they can 'invest' on the ground level. 

Calling a wallet generated IOU a coin is deceiving to new users and even to some experienced ones. They cannot see the difference and that those 'coins' were never mined and can be printed to infinity with just a few key strokes.

Is that more clear now? I am not ranting about gateways reliability but about scams within the ripple system."
2014-03-16 17:34:24;My Opinion on Ripple (XRP);"Ripple is most decidedly *not* centralized.  Yes, the majority of it is still held by Ripple Labs, but when they distribute it, they no longer have any control over it.

Anyone can run a server, and nobody can freeze, or place arbitrary restrictions on your account.  You can't get that out of a centraized system.

Also, it cannot be mined.  The whole computing for good thing is different from mining, in that there's an organization that holds a bunch of XRP, and they distribute it in exchange for people lending their computing power.Yes, I understand that Ripple cannot be mined.  I'll make it more clear in the post that by ""mine"" I meant on the general basis that you give up your computers CPU in exchange for a currency.  That's why I said ""technically"" but I'll make the change accordingly because it was a bad choice of words.

You can do a withdrawal through DividendRippler, though (which also means you'll save a little bit because you won't need to convert BTC/DR to BTC/Bitstamp). Go to dividendrippler.com and enter your ripple address in the search box. (If the processing system is offline, you'll have to wait for it to be back up.) Enter a Bitcoin address as your withdrawal address, and follow the instructions to confirm the change – it involves sending 1 XRP to Dividend Rippler (make sure to get the destination tag right – I believe you use dt=1 for this step). Then, once you've checked that it updated, follow the steps to redeem the BTC IOUs by sending them to DividendRippler's address (again, check the destination tag – it'll be a different one unique to your address).

Circonference.caI think part of it is just the anti-ripple bias out there, but there are a number of places to buy it now. JustCoin and bitstamp are 2 big exchanges that deal in it. One other reason might be that Ripple has their own server + client, while it is easy to use just the n-th ripoff of the bitcoin-Core daemon and have the same interface all over again, adding Ripple's API to your backend needs more effort than just copy paste and changing the name.one part of the answer might also be the fact that ripple (as in the system not as in XRP) is a marketplace by itself. so everything one needs is a relatively small amount of XRPs to get started, after this one can trade in the ripple-client.Thanks for the info! I guess a follow on question would be that; surely it is in line to go on other exchanges soon?.. Seems a safe bet? And if/when it does that should increase the price?

2014-03-28 10:54:33;Please someone ELI5 why ripple is different/good;"While most Xcoins can be described as ""digital gold"", ripple is better described as a payment system or a trust network. It's basically ""modern"" banking done right.

You can have ripples (XRP) just as you can have bitcoin, but in addition to that you can lend trust to other users, such as kraken or one day maybe your bank. What this means is that kraken can hold any asset for you that they are willing to hold, and have this registered in the ripple network as an IOU. So you deposit say USD, then withdraw kraken-USD or maybe kraken-EUR on ripple. Note that the actual USD is still held by kraken, but the ripple network has registered that they owe you some amount of USD. IOU's can be issued arbitrarily provided a trust line has been made, so if you trusted me I could easily issue you an IOU for a trillion BTC just because. Hence you'd be a fool to trust me. :)

If you have your kraken-USD and I then have my bitstamp-USD or why not bitstamp-EUR or bitstamp-BTC, we can trade these with each other over ripple provided that theres a third user involved called a market maker. What they do is to lend trust to both kraken and bitstamp in this case, then offer to exchange value between these gateways as they're called in ripple-lingo. And here's where the ripple native currency XRP really comes in to play, because bitstamp want none of those kraken-USD, they want an asset they trust, and that's XRP.

I may have derailed into details. This is super new to me but quite exciting. Note however that ripple is not a cryptocurrency in the same sense that bitcoin is, it's more of a payment network, and you should evaluate it as any other such. That is, today it's basically a better paypal, but you need to trust paypal. In the future, maybe you won't have to trust ripple labs.

No ELI5, but I hope it's something.Ripple provides three fundamental elements in my mind.

1. XRP. The least interesting one. They're a tiny part of what ripple brings to the table. They are similar to altcoins in that they behave as a ""money as an asset"", and their primary use is to ""grease up"" ripple transactions with tiny fees and small reserves.  
It's the bit that bitcoin folks recognize immediately and therefore project the value of ripple onto it, but that's missing the bigger picture.

2. Debt ( / IOUs). Ripple is about a ""money as debt"" model. Take a second to take that in, because it's pretty much the polar opposite of bitcoin.    
Anybody on the ripple network can issue debt, the value of which is very strongly tied to the trust people place in the issuer.  
For example, I've issued myself a million dollars of debt. It's not worth much. I've also traded a few XRPs for 25 cents of debt issued by bitstamp. That's worth 25 cents. That value is primarily guaranteed by bitstamp, and can be converted into other debts (like bitcoin debt) or into XRP.

3. Trading. Baked into the core Ripple protocol is a full-featured exchange. Anybody can place trades between two IOUs, or between an IOU and XRP, at the exchange rate and the quantity they want.  
The ripple network will automatically resolve trades, settling results into the proper accounts.  
This is not a small thing, as it provides a distributed exchange mechanism that can work with XRPs, altcoin IOUs or fiat IOUs.

Note that I said ""distributed"" rather than ""decentralized."" The wording is not accidental, as every ripple consensus server is controlled by Ripple Labs. It's been said that this may change when Ripple becomes production-ready. We'll see.  
However, gateway servers such as bitstamp or kraken's operate independently from Rippple Labs, although their purpose is limited to issuing, trading and repaying debt.The fastest, shortest version is that Ripple is not an alt coin.  Think of it as a marketplace and exchange protocol.  For example, Ripple (theoretically) could be a competitor to Cryptsy; you can buy/sell/trade currencies on it.  But even then Cryptsy could use Ripple as a back-end for its trades so it doesn't have to maintain its own marketplace.

Once you're able to separate Ripple the network from XRP the ""intermediate currency"", you'll see what Ripple is about and how it works in tandem (rather than against) bitcoin and other alt coins.
"
2014-03-27 12:01:45;A bitcoiner's first impression of ripple;"> part of which is to keep transaction fees low, implying a cheap XRP.

This seems like a fundamental misconception. Transaction fees and account reserves are decided by the consensus process, so even with a high price per XRP, the transaction fee can be set low. (There's a caveat, because the granularity of XRP comes into play, but it's not a big deal – for transactions to be less than a tenth of a cent, the price of XRP can grow to $1000 each. This corresponds to a market cap of around $100 trillion, in the ""world currency"" range, so there's *plenty* of room for XRP to grow without making transactions expensive. If absolutely necessary, a change to the protocol can further subdivide XRP, removing this cap.)

> Ripples exist, afaik, for the sole purpose of preventing spam of transactions on the network.

> Then suddenly the intended XRP-users have the ripples they need, and now what do you do with yours? Who would buy them, other than the bigger fool?

There's also a subtle misconception at play here. While spam prevention makes them necessary (and I don't know how you'd make a Ripple clone without them), that's not the only reason you might hold them. They're the only currency in Ripple which is not an IOU, so there's no counterparty risk to holding them. (Although currently you need to factor the actions of Ripple Labs into evaluating the exchange rate risk.) There are also no additional fees to transacting with them, unlike most gateway IOUs. They are also useful as a ""bridge"" currency – as long as there is a liquid market between a given IOU and XRP, it can be traded with other IOUs even if there aren't people trading directly between the two.

Basically, as long as people are using Ripple, it makes sense that they would also be using XRP as a currency. It's certainly not the point of Ripple, but I'd say its speculative value is still pretty closely tied with the overall success of Ripple.

Also, Ripple Labs' holdings' effect on the speculative value of XRP won't last forever. They don't have the ability to print unlimited XRP, and not all of what they hold is earmarked for giveaways. Once they're through that, they'll presumably be selling it at market rates in order to maximize their profit. Certainly the position of Ripple Labs is something you should think about carefully before investing in XRP, but I don't think it's clear that investing in it is a sucker's game. And if you do think that – don't invest.[deleted]With ripple trust networks, it gives individuals all the 'power' that banks originally held. The individual becomes the issuer of trust and spending power is based on your p2p reputation.. http://weboftrust.netHere's the reason bitcoiners have such a hard time wrapping their head around Ripple: like you said, bitcoin is a currency, but ripple is more of a distributed exchange/payment network.

I do not treat XRP as a currency. Some people do. I think this is a silly thing to do, but to each their own. That said, I do have a bunch of it, because I'm running a gateway, and we're using it to activate new accounts for our customers.I find it interesting that people who have been [""Primed""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology) by their awareness and affinity for Bitcoin seem to come the the same ""first glance"" conclusions. When they learn more this changes. 

*Just my opinion* When I first came across Bitcoin (2009/10) I immediately understood what it was, but it never made me excited. What surprised me was the speed of acceptance. My guess is that in the throws of a DEEP recession people have an innate desire to point the finger and say ""it's your fault"" and that finger pointed at the Fed and the Banks. The spirit of the finger pointing was ""Anti"" and Bitcoin got positioned as an alternative, then built a cult following. For the non-finance minded people out there, when they learned about Bitcoin, they actually learned something new about currency, so they felt smart and went all ""bazonkers"".  I am not prone to things which are ""Anti"" and never saw a long-term need for a new currency, we have plenty. 

If you want to make the inflationary argument read this (if not skip this paragraph). The ""Anti"" feelings were fueled by fear of inflation resulting from the Fed's actions. I understand this fear and it is based on fundamentals. Bitcoin is said ""not to be Inflationary"" because there is a fixed number of coins that will ever exist, I also fundamentally get that. BUT Bitcoins can be sliced into smaller and smaller pieces (currently set at 8 decimal places) this is exactly the same as ""inflation"" it just occurs on the other side of the decimal point. When the Fed is ""printing"" the supply increases and the theoretical value decreases. When Bitcoins get sliced into smaller and smaller pieces (maybe a future 10 decimal places) the supply is effectively increased. The nominal price of Bitcoins is increased, just like the nominal price of dollars increases with inflation. The gamble of owning Bitcoins is in the spread between the inflation rate of Bitcoins (idk what it has been but it's Huge) and your chosen ""base"" currency's inflation rate. OK, ready, set, go ""start arguing""... This is why Bitcoin never excited me, I don't see it solving any long-term problem other than to make someone who is ""Anti"" inflation, Fed, Banks feel better, & make a pile of profit on speculation.  
Bitcoiner's Cons about Ripple:

* It is centrally controlled by the implied evil people at Ripple Labs - AKA ""Anti"".
* Why do we need another cryptocurrency anyway - This applies to Bitcoin also
* I cant mine XRP and I want to - WorldCommunity Grid project lets you accomplish this
* The transaction network part is cool, Ripple is different, so this is not like Bitcoin. Phew, I dont have to worry, I am safe with my Bitcoin. 

When I first came across Ripple I was almost instantly blown away. Here was an application of cryptocurrency that actually solved a huge problem, & it's opensource! The cost of transactions goes to nil, opening up the bottom 2 billion to be serviced profitably by the financial sector. The Ledger operates on a P2P global network. The cost of maintaining the system is a fraction of the electricity required to maintain the Bitcoin system. The Consensus process seems to mimic the existing process of clearing transactions used by the financial institutions to prevent the double spend problem. ie: the two banks agree the money has moved from this account to that account (the more things change the more they stay the same). 

Regarding XRP's roll in the Ripple network (I also really like networks) is two part. First there are some security features to prevent Spam and Scam. Second, and more importantly XRP acts as a ""bridge"" currency for payments by using Market Makers on each side of a trade to grease the wheels of international commerce. Again this mimics the existing financial infrastructure with market makers who work in currency trading (the more things change the more they stay the same). There are reasons things are done the way they are currently done, and those reasons will not disappear just because we are talking cryptocurrency. The final Con of Bitcoiner's aginst Ripple is the existing discrepancy in the size of the community of Bitcoin -vs- Ripple. To that I say, Just wait till the existing financial services companies begin to adopt the Ripple network. If you thought Bitcoin got pervasive fast my guess is you aint seen nothing yet. 

Please notice that I have no opinion or care to speculate on either Bitcoin or Ripple's XRP future value. I do however believe that Ripple is a very significant financial innovation, with long-term positive implications on global society. I just cant say the same thing about Bitcoin.  Thanks for your comments.

The China news will affect XRP price in that BTC and XRP prices are somewhat intertwined at the moment. The cool thing is Ripple, the system, works no matter what the price of XRP is.

You've really just got to remember that Ripple is still in beta. One major bank on the system would be pretty big for this year and if it happened you can bet we'd get a spike in adoption.https://xrptalk.org/topic/2125-ripples-progress-in-the-last-few-months-by-bibbit/?p=25639I expect that adoption will continue to suffer as long as Ripple remains a de-facto centralized system, because there's simply not enough meaningful differentiation from a traditional crypto-exchange, and a lot more peculiarities to learn and adjust to.

I have heard the line: ""RL is keeping the network centralized while in beta to facilitate development"", and I'm not sure I buy it. It's a matter of priorities. There are other networks that are in beta and have managed to do significant changes to their network while being decentralized from day one.  

One big uncertainty in the back of my mind (other perhaps others') is that I don't really know how decentralized Ripple will ever be, even if it comes out of its beta state. There's something about a ""consensus"" process that isn't vulnerable to 51% attacks, and provides no positive incentives for anyone to set up a consensus server of their own that doesn't really seem amenable to decentralization. But it's entirely possible I've missed something, and that RL has solved the byzantine thingy in yet another wonderful new way. Maybe.

Until that happens, the Ripple network remains essentially an over-complicated exchange mechanism, and I predict you won't see the exponential growth everybody is waiting for.

Adding new and exciting features on top of it is unlikely to change that. There's one feature that's purposefully being held back, which in turn is holding back growth.
> I expect that adoption will continue to suffer as long as Ripple remains a de-facto centralized system

How is Ripple a de-facto centralized system? Their website, Wiki and Forum openly explain that Ripple Labs is the managing company behind Ripple, the protocol and XRP etc. By de facto, do you mean they are not a legal entity? 8-\

I'd like to point out something you aren't considering. One of the biggest advantages that Ripple has over Bitcoin is its speed, but more than this, it is actually the fact that they are one company managing the protocol. Like Google, the Android operating system has become the dominant mobile OS precisely because it's one good company guiding the development, API platform, processes etc. Without a central company guiding overall development, Bitcoin will become a hot mess of startups trying to build their own jagged forks, while mining pools will become one massive weight dragging down the entire system left unmanaged.

See this GigaOm article that highlights my point further: ""So what will it take to get bitcoin to go from techie fetish to common currency? Allaire said that cryptocurrencies, recently dubbed a “fifth protocol” for the internet, require better standard systems and a company akin to Red Hat – a corporation that packages open-source software into practical commercial products."" [source](http://gigaom.com/2014/04/07/bitcoin-will-be-part-of-the-global-banking-order-says-circle-ceo/)"
2014-04-09 02:13:32;Ripple is ‘Bitcoin without the libertarian agenda’;"Ripple allows regular businesses to create trust and issue their own IOUs on the network - allowing market making and instant liquidity depending on a companies' reputation.  For example, if JP Morgan Chase issued an IOU on Ripple that was backed by some financial product/service, you can bet people would want to participate.

If the Ice Cream man issued his own IOUs he wouldn't have the same credibility as JP Morgan chase -- but at least has has equal access to the network.

So Ripple is a system that rewards credibility and transparency.  Cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin 1.0 are just tokens traded between anonymous people that they used their computers to discover.  They only have value because some other anonymous people are willing to speculate that it might be worth more in the future.  There's no company backing them and no guarantee that the developers won't just move onto the next ""great coin"".

Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin have first mover advantages and they have transparent development teams.  They don't really offer anything unique in terms of commerce other than different confirmation times.  But none of them can compete with Ripple's 3-5 second transactions and 1000's of transactions per second while also providing a free IOU exchange built into the protocol as well as smart contracts.  All the while still offering the benefits of Bitcoin through XRP.

I know there are always other ideas in the works... but Ripple is doing this now and has some serious advantages.Ok I'll play.  As a legitimate middle ground what peace does rippling bring.  To me it doesn't cancel out these 2 extremes,  just exaggerates a west-east follow that we assume to be untideable.  P2P2TM"

2014-04-14 16:31:33;Interview with Co-founder and CEO of Ripple;">That is our business model. We’re keeping 25% of those XRP, and using the rest of it to incent market makers, gateways, consumers to come onto the protocol. We use the 25% to cover the bills here. We’ve been successful at that, we’re cash flow positive, and it has worked out well.

This part I don't understand.  Why use XRP to cover the bills and simultaneously telling people not to buy it?

It's just basic economics that if supply increases and demand does not increase to meet that supply, the price will fall.

2014-04-25 12:44:14;Confused Ripple Noob;"Ok, so your confusion seems to stem from thinking that XRP is what people mean when they say ""Ripple"".  XRP on Ripple was created to serve several purposes (antispam, etc), but you can understand everything that happens on the network without ever touching XRP.

Ripple is a distributed debt-tracking system.  Users tell the system what other accounts they trust to borrow money from them, and what size of debt they trust that account to hold for them.  Users can then put in offers to trade debt from one account (denominated in some currency) for the debt from another account (denominated in the same or another currency) at some price.  (Trust lines also by default act as similar liquidity between debt held in the same currency.)

So, in your specific case, you get someone who is highly trusted (like Bitstamp) to owe you USD (by ""depositing"" USD with them) and then you can send that debt to other users and it will move either to someone else who also trusts Bitstamp, or through trust lines and trade orders to convert to a sort of debt that whoever you are paying wants to accept.

The ""actual USD"" get back out when someone redeems their debt, according to whatever agreement they have with the entity that owes them money.Also I forgot to ask. It seems xrp is neither proof of stake of proof of work, so how do xrp confirmations get made and what is it called?

Is there such thing as a 51% attack (or something similar) in the ripple network?The learning curve for Ripple is high right now, so don't feel noobish! Ripple works a lot like existing banking institutions. Simply put, it's a decentralized p2p settlement system. So you on the right track.

We'll use USD as the thing of value in this example. With USD in hand, a balance is issued in Ripple for the equivalent amount of USD. They you do whatever you want with the USD. Send it, exchange it, buy something with it, whatever. 

If you issued the balance yourself, the only people willing to take it will be people that trust you will settle it. Meaning, when they want that USD out of Ripple, they trust that they can give you back the USD balance in Ripple and you will give them the USD outside of Ripple.

In practice today, you will likely deposit your USD with a gateway that issues USD balances in Ripple. Like Bitstamp. Then, with BitstampUSD in hand, you do whatever you want with it; let's say you trade it. When the new owner of the BitstampUSD wants to receive USD outside of Ripple, they go through Bitstamp's settlement procedure and they are done. Same goes for yourself; if you had traded you BitstampUSD for some JustcoinBTC, you could settle your BTC balance with Justcoin. 

Settlement procedures for gateways vary but are approaching a standard. 

Notice I said ""thing of value"" in the beginning of the USD example. That's because almost anything could be traded on Ripple. Right now, Ripple is like early caveman magically discovering an iPhone. So far, the caveman has found the iPhone to be useful for some stuff like banging on things. It turned on, so it looks really cool. It seems to make sounds, which is really cool to cavemen at the time. But the iPhone can do a whole lot more that the caveman and his friends are barely starting to realize.
your USD value is independent from the value of XRP.  If XRP goes down, your USD stays the same.

this is why holding XRP is risky compared to holding USD in terms of value stability.

but XRP is also completely counter-party risk free, in the future, it is likely that many people will hold XRP and hedge with IOUsGuys I'd just like to say thanks all for the replies. I tried submitting a reply before but for some reason it didn't seem to go through. I'm amazed by all the responses I got. It says wonders about how much you all believe in this system. 

I've spent the day trying to work out ripple, and with your help, I think I'm nearly there. I'm still confused about one thing however. 

Firstly, does a gateway business have to accept xrp in the form of payment for them to issue their credit or can they receive payment from external sources outside of the ripple network and then issue to debt. 

Secondly, can anybody talk honestly and openly about the centralized nature of the ripple network. To be more specific, the obviously centralized monopoly over xrp and secondly about what I may be wrong about, but the centralized nature of the consensus network. More specifically, the weaknesses of these centralization problems and why they may or may not matter. 

Also it would seem that the trust system of the ripple consensus network could be easily broken? Or am I missing the point. Is the consensus network not like one big bitcoin blockchain, but rather many individual small blockchains that are started by the people who trust the gateway? Does this mean a 51% attack is possible within a trust network?

2014-05-02 17:48:49;How will ripple solve these issues?;"> One solution might be for you to specify a fee that you charge between different IOU sources.

This has been supported ever since the first public release of the implementation from Ripple Labs -- it's called ""quality"".  Hopefully there will eventually be widgets to set it in the reference client, but right now you have to use the API to set it.> As far as I know, there are no repayment terms associated with IOUs in Ripple

Never issue a trust line to someone unless you understand what conditions govern that trust line -- including repayment terms.That first solution can be more or less modeled by placing an open order between USD:barclay and USD:buddy for $50, or perhaps two open orders with a tiny price delta going in both directions.

As it stands now, there's seemingly very little to gain, and quite a bit to lose by enabling ""rippling"" on trust lines, and until someone can make a compelling case otherwise, I'd strongly recommend you never enable it.
(1)   When you create a trust line, the default setting in Ripple is ""no rippling"", meaning this will not happen.   If you choose to allow rippling, i.e. one-to-one swapping of the same currency between two gateways, it is your option to do so, but it is not the default.   (This change in default setting is relatively new.  This was a source of user confusion and has since been corrected).  

(2)  Repayment terms are specified by the gateway that's holding your deposits, not by the protocol itself.   Just like your relationship with your bank, you should ensure that your Ripple gateway has clear repayment terms.   

I wouldn't suggest you use Ripple to casually track debts between friends, as in your example, precisely because the lack of repayment terms could get messy/ugly.   

As long as you and I both ""trust"" Citibank, which has clear repayment terms, then the two of us can still transact.  I can send you Citibank USD balances.  We don't need to run debts between each other.  "

I think you guys are missing one point.  A coin is worth what people will pay for it.  XNF is proof of this.  GBC is book-building at a higher price, but it has 1/10th OZ of gold as a price floor, meaning that GBC guarantees it will buy back at that price. 

It might not be explained well, but GBC is not an IOU for 1/10th an ounce of gold, rather it is a trading instrument that has a buy-back value as well as speculative value.

It's sad that such ignorance claims to be journalism."
2014-05-25 08:29:22;Response to recent Ripple drama;"""20% amongst founders is standard. ""

i think you are making a mistake here. Jed already got an (unknown) share of the Ripple Labs company, that's the startup fueling the project and nobody argues it's 100% ok that he gets a large share of it

the point is that XRP currency is not the same thing as Ripple Labs company. So on top of whatever their share of the company is, the founders allocated themselves an EXTRA 20% of the total XRP that there will ever be. 

So that's the heart of the matter here.Your conclusion that Jed is trying to cripple RL seems to be the only explanation for his action but he might actually just be an altruist who thinks he is doing the right. It is really hard to tell because crashing XRP was violent and dramatic. It was either done out of ignorance or nefariousness.

The motivation does not appear to be money but ideology. Jed seems to be leveraging the fact he was given ""founder XRP"" to force the other holders to defend their allotment. He is exploiting the fundamental nature of XRP's creation to undermine the market value. XRP were premined and BTC is not.

Announcing an intent to sell a large block of shares is met with front-running. This is market fundamentals 101. The result of this announcement was obvious before it was made.Subduction

These posts do serve a purpose. They motivate the Board to quickly resolve what they should have done months ago.You're really not helping with posts like this.

If you want to brag about what an awesome insider you are about something try to find a topic that isn't so important.Le Tanque,

I do not think you understand developers or creators... I believe I do...

Developers create 'systems' because:

1: they can

2: they enjoy the intellectual and disciplinary challenge to build a team that can change the status quo

3: they are not motivated by money. 
Sure, money pays the personal bills, the employees, but it is not the prime driver. The second string of CEOs and management people from the investor community are certainly motivated by money. No problem with that, but it is important to recognize that the creative and operational/company growth people are very different.

4: when there is a transition from the creative team to the operational/growth team - it is best to make a clean break. The developers should be cut loose and paid for their original work. Disputes should be understood and dealt with before the transition.

5: Open source operational CEOs are easily replaced and they understand that.

6: It would appear that Jed, feels that the RL company's focus on the existing financial community (aka banks) is not what he intended for the Ripple tech. Rather it would appear that he believes that individuals (not corporations) should grow the emergent peer-to-peer Internet of value systems. This is fair. Furthermore, he appears willing to cut loose his investment in XRP to make the point. I do not see a problem with that, as we can all see that the Ripple tech is effectively BitCoin 2.0 technology, that is, it is more than just money (which is what BitCoin 1.0 is focused on). Ripple tech is powerful and will be adopted by the banks, as they do not have a choice. The banks must either engage or be bypassed. [by the way - BitCoin 1.0 has a 10 minute problem which is actually a 60 minute problem in reality, as it usually takes 6 confirmations for an Exchange to validate a BitCoin 1.0 transaction. Light years too long! Ripple does not have this problem]

7: The ~20 Billion XRP allocations are a problem for the RL Board to deal with, and they have not. It would appear to me, that the investors should now ensure that the Board resolves this matter soon.

8: I would expect that the new Secret Project by Jed will be effectively BitCoin 2.5. He will need to build on the existing BitCoin currency and embrace the BitCoin developer community. This is a big problem for Ripple in the medium term, as the banks will need to evaluate Ripple networking/exchanges vs BitCoin community releases, momentum and announcements. Ripple has not managed its public image at all. News has been non-existent. Eco-system extensions to the Ripple network have been non-existant. No news is not good news. This is the CEOs responsibility.

-

Le Tanque, I could find nothing in your comments to suggest that you understand the issues.

-

I expect that Ripple Labs will continue with the banks and this will reinforce the emergence of the BitCoin transactions as the defacto standard for a global digital currency. Furthermore, I expect, that Jed's Secret Project will be a cause for concern for Ethereum and MasterCoin.

In tech... the best idea wins.

I gotta side with Ripple on this one. You were a board member of a company. That role you accepted comes with responsibilities that don't magically go away once you decide to quit.

Building a company that has disruptive technologies is difficult. Boards are meant to mediate and help navigate the company in times of prosper AND in times of difficult and internal disagreements.

You can totally bail on your role and let others take over, but airing dirty laundry, especially now that you've left, only hurts the company and I think you're well aware of what that effect would be.

one thing that transpires through your letter is the question of what different people mean by ""return"". This term seems somehow entangled with the notion of ""lockup"". If i understand correctly

1) According to this letter it seems that Chris consider a ""return"" the process by which his XRP allocation would be effectively ""locked up"" for a certain portion of time

2) On the other hand you consider that ""return"" means ""change of ownership"" and therefore a transfer of XRP can be considered a return only if it is permanent.

As a consequence of this various people start accusing others of false claims, lies etc... but you pinned down the source of the ambiguity. 

It would appear to me that the outcome of all of this hinges on the accusation that Chris and Jed stole their allotments of XRP from company resources.  I would assume that there are board minutes where this decision was authorized.  As for the timings of the transactions that provided the founders with their huge XRP allotments, they should be relatively easy to identify and corroborate.

If there was theft involved, everyone involved is going to be lawyering up pretty soon.  It's a shame really.SF crypto dude here. Much respect. I saw/heard you speak at a 20Mission meetup and the Ripple developers summit. You've always struck me as a very level-headed like-minded individual. Two things you said have really stuck with me (paraphrasing): 

1 ) Don't have access to your customers' keys and/or money. Too much can go wrong.

2) Ripple is a great technology.

I keep both of those in mind as I architect my startup's backend. Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks and keep on keepin it real on the crypto scene. Good luck through all this drama.Jesse,

Wow, lawyers, bad move.

Quick question: Were the missing ledgers from 0 to 32,570 and the chances of their recovery ever discussed at board level? It's a horrible and probably coincidental fact that the transactions that detail these huge allocations are unavailable in the ledger and probably never will be.Jesse, you have balls of steel. Good luck.
1: Jesse makes excellent points about the allocation of XRP without company consent and early OpenCoin investor consent.

2: The Lawyer, George Frost - will be looking for a new job on Monday morning. [what a disaster! his letter has caused. If Chris Larsen authorized this letter, his position/role in the company should be reviewed.

3: Social networking and corporate disputes may actually work in the future. If this 'original sin' of privately awarding individuals in the company, with company assets had been buried, then we in the XRP/BitCoin would not have understood, the essence of the BitCoin Internet meme that opposes Ripple.

I would like to see Ripple succeed. This issue needs to be cleaned up - real soon, else, it will take on a larger than life network effect...Wait -- you said in your post that Chris declined to return his share and was hostile, but now you are saying it ""was your understanding that"" and asking for a clarification of his position?

That's a very big distinction, and if the statements were not exactly as you initially described them then they are easily libelous.

If you don't have an attorney I would get one right now.  The court of public opinion is not the same as a court of law, and by my reading you may well be in serious and expensive trouble.

Seriously.  Don't be stupid.  Get a lawyer, stop publishing public responses to grave legal documents, and shut the fuck up so your attornies can do their work."

2014-05-27 20:36:57;Ripple Price Rebounds After CEO Pledges 7 Billion XRP Donation;"One question, as someone who is looking to invest in Ripple:  Won't this lead to 14 billion Ripple hitting the market eventually?  Isn't that donation going to eventually be converted to fiat?Hmm... no details...

Item #1:
SamS in an previous comment, on another thread, made some good points about 'foundations' controlled by 'special interests'. SamS cited some seven issues, but the one that I thought was most relevant is - Does Chris Larsen, the individual receive tax break or reduction for from his foundations gifts of XRP?

Item #2
Is there a special relationship between Ripple Labs and Chris Larsen, in that does Chris Larsen receive any benefit from Ripple Labs relating to how the 'foundation' awards XRP to developing markets, in the future. I could imagine scenarios where this could happen.

Item #3
Does Chris Larsen actually own the ~7 Billion XRP, in question. Jesse Powell suggests that this is a question that needs a technical answer.

It would seem to me that Jed McCaleb's suggestion to simply return (as in really return) the XRP to Ripple Labs, is the cleanest solution.

Who is dragging their feet on this and why?
This is a good move indeed.
I also want to see public's reaction when Mr. McCaleb makes ""his dump"" right into faces of thousands of people who support and invested in Ripple technology.Long live the king!""Rebounds""Insiders... are stabilizing XRP.
..
Question remains what happens on June 4?"
2014-05-27 01:11:40;An open letter to Ripple Labs' Board;"This letter is succinct and addresses the issue exactly.Meh. The real issue is that this kind of things can be an issue in the first place.

Crypto-currencies' raison d'etre is to remove any reliance on central financial institutions.

If you're not sold by that, you don't need crypto-currencies. You can just have whatever system you want running on your little servers, and ask your users to trust you to do the right thing.  

If you paint your system as a crypto-currency despite a complete reliance on a central institution, you're doing something weird. Some would say you're deceiving your users, others that you're deceiving yourself. Either way, you are straying from the path.

Indeed, in the design of Ripple, we keep seeing a number of hints that the system can be decentralized. Yet it is not.  

Ripple Labs are at the center of the Ripple universe, and as of right now, it is impossible to use Ripple without Ripple Labs.

And so we now have impotent open letters, that beg Ripple Labs to do the Right Thing, because the control that ought to be have been decentralized by a crypto-currency was kept tightly in the palm of one corporations and its founders.

If things had been done properly, none of this latest crisis should have been possible.

Can things be fixed? I don't know. How eloquently can you beg?
Update: One of the XRPTalk.org members has passed this letter along to Ripple Labs with a request that it gets shared with the board members.Why all this fuss over the advertised not competing with bitcoin, self-described ""stamps"" for the Ripple system?> This letter is on behalf of the Ripple community

Extremely arrogant and presumptuous. Who elected you the spoke-person?"
2014-05-27 00:32:55;"Should one make sure to stay away from the next ""Big Secret Bitcoin Project"" by Mr Jed McCaleb?";"Here's the thing about this latest fiasco: I literally do not care about the price of XRP. It's, in my humble opinion, the absolute least interesting aspect of the ripple protocol.

To me, the thing that makes ripple interesting is the whole social credit aspect, and the ability to send IOUs between people who don't necessarily know or trust eachother (you know, the actual ""rippling"" part).

If I want a cryptocurrency, I'll use bitcoin. I've never thought of the two as being even remotely the same thing.

What the community needs most right now is to get more independent validators up and running, so that the network isn't so reliant upon Ripple Labs.How could ANY legitimate organization work with him in the future without thinking in the back of their head... ""this guy is gonna scorch the earth if he feels like it...and he HAS.""Lol, my thoughts exactly. The funniest thing is McCaleb posted to xrp owners - conned by his friends and associated, who have been selling for about 5 weeks, knowing about Jed's incoming fire sale - to ""compensate"" them by offering them to invest in his new project. That he will most likely abandon soon and maybe even attempt to kill, like ripple. The guy seems a bit delusional.Blaming the Great Goxxing on Jed makes little sense, unless you have any indication that the root of the problems that destroyed MtGox in 2014 could be found in what was sold back in March 2011. Do you?  

There's a fair amount of he-said-she-said between Chris, Jed and Jesse, so good luck asserting with certainty what the motivation of each player really might be here. unless you have some really good insider info.    
I'll just note that Jed's announcement provides a great object lesson on the problems of having a few entities holding a huge rib-eye steak of a given crypto-currency.  
It might be coincidental that the existence and control of those large holdings seems central to the dispute here. It might not.

You've made up your mind, and Betteridge's law of headlines be damned, you're going to stay away from the next Jed project.  
That's fine. I had no idea he even had a next project until this whole mess happened, and I doubt I'm alone in this.

I for one intend to judge whatever comes next on its own merits, one of which will be its reliance on trusted third parties (or hopefully lack thereof.)

I'm kind of out of the loop; where and how did this person get a billion XRP?"
2014-06-06 03:31:28;Ripple? what is ripple? Brick and Mortar would like to know.;"So, I think ripple wouldn't necessarily be a crypto that you would want to 'accept', rather, it's a protocol / system that you would use to power your POS / payment system which would allow you to accept all fiat types (USD, Euro, Yen, etc.) as well as Cryptos (Doge, BTC, LTC, etc.).

It also allows for the seamless and instant conversion between these different stores of value with almost no cost. So, if you accepted a payment in LTC, but weren't particularly fond of holding LTC, you could convert it to USD or BTC, all within ripple. 

Let me know if you have any other questions -- I saw that your spot is across the street from Cheebo. My office is like two blocks down haha, I'll try and swing by :)nice.. thanks for the explanation, and stop by anytime, i'm kinda intrigued tho. I'll dip more into it see if there are any personal and business benefits. Comparing Bitcoin to Ripple is a bit like comparing cars to roads. Both are designed to enable you to get from A to B, but they're very different.

Edit: actually, Bitcoin is more like an ATV, in that it doesn't need roads.As said here.  XRP is not useful for you mrfjdominguez, but Ripple could be useful to you in the future if your bank is on the network, ie: Fidor Bank."

NACHA, previously the National Automated Clearing House Association, is a not-for-profit industry body of financial institutions that serves as trustee for the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, the backbone for electronic payments and movement of money and financial data in the US.

The ACH Network is similar to the SWIFT network that facilitates international money movements.

Although Ripple Labs is a software company rather than a financial institution per se, it provides an open-source base platform “that resides at the bottom of the payment stack” for others to build upon.

Ideally, the company sees itself as replacing some of the most basic infrastructure functions of the ACH network: 22 Billion Thats a lot of transactions!

""About NACHA
NACHA represents over 11,000 US financial institutions who fund the organization either directly or via regional associations. The ACH Network itself, which is separate, moves about 22 billion transactions and $39tn (yes, trillion) annually.""

Instead: Send your fiat cash into your Ripple wallet where you'll trade it for XRP. 

As unethical as it is, Bitstamp claims they charge what seems like a reasonable fee (1 - 3% or something like that), but what they do not disclose is that they are skimming by using a ""retail price"".

2014-07-22 17:23:17;Freeze proposal might fundamentally alter ripple IOUs: no longer fungible;"I do not like the direction that Ripple is taking. First they push rippletrade (wallet with compulsory verification -- email at least), now freeze, server decentralization remains delayed.

I can imagine that Bitstamp will soon require verification ""in order to protect law-abiding customers"" for every Ripple user holding their IOUs or see them frozen if they fail to do so. Also, the legacy anonymous client will be made incompatible with a protocol update. They will give up the decentralized server idea too, saying that they would need control of the protocol.

After that, Ripple Labs will realize that they have not built more than another Paypal (not anonymous, freezable and centralized), but smaller and without any of its network effects. Come on, this is not the Ripple I fell in love with!

**Ripple is supposed to be a Bitcoin 2.0, not another OkPay**In real life, tradable IOUs (those of a same issuance at least) are all equal.

This used to be the case in Ripple also, but not anymore once account_freeze is implemented. If some IOUs can be arbitrarily frozen by the issuer, then all of them become much less valuable and the Ripple network as a whole loses utility.

Freeze seems unnecessary at best and dangerous at worst:

- Fraud and money laundering can already be prevented at the gateway level; the ledger is public. Once a user want to redeem IOUs, she may be required to disclose how she obtained them and verify it against the public transactions.

- Saying that it is required ""to be compliant with regulations"" is nonsense. Regulations may be void if unenforceable (e.g., the bit-license proposal). Modifying the protocol to make them enforceable at the network level will not make ripple ""more legal""; all anti-money laundering could and should be done at the gateway level (as it is currently done).

- It is not really an optional feature in practice. Regulators will *require* it. Also, it will be enabled by default unless the no_freeze flag is set.""might""?

It already did, they are now _all_ freezable by default, something that was not the case before today.Insurance of what.. Self insured is best"

2014-08-21 09:02:44;Is it cheaper to trade of BTC/USD on ripple or on an exchange (such as Bitstamp)? (x-post from /r/Bitcoin);"Ripple has the following fee schedule:

 - You need to have XRP reserves for every offer you have outstanding. You do not have to pay these, as when the offer is fulfilled, the XRP is available again, but make sure you have enough XRP if you wanna place offers on different markets.

 - You pay a small fee for every offer you place or every offer you change. This fee is very low and mostly negligible. This fee does not scale with the volume of your offer, it's just a fee to place the offer. However, if you are margin trading, you will have to change your offer fairly frequently. And that's when you should watch out.

This transaction fee (placing/changing an offer is considered a transaction in Ripple) is currently set at 10 drops or 0.00001 XRP. That's almost nothing, but it can change. For now, would you f.e. use an arbitrage bot that automatically adjusts your offer every second, it would still only costs you 0.864 XRP a day, that;s only something like 0.004 USD.

So basically, for now, Ripple trading is almost free. Your only cost will be your initial 30-40 XRP for your reserves.It's much cheaper to send your fiat into your Ripple wallet, then trade your USD (or other currency) into XRP. I've seen Bitstamp's quote on average around 30% higher than the market value. Do this by pretending to buy XRP within Bitstamp, and it will display their quote for you. After some simple math, you can estimate what you'll [get](http://www.ripplecharts.com/#/) by trading within your R-wallet.

2014-09-06 08:38:48;Highlights of Ripple;"Ripple allows it's users to own and use the currencies it knows and wants to use. When a merchants wants to receive Bitcoin, but you only have Bitcoin, the purchase price will automatically be shown and calculated in Euro and the Ripple system will find a way to automatically exchange your euros to bitcoins along the way.

This can happen across borders and with minimal fees. The actual fees will lower the more people use Ripple.

The other side of the story is that Ripple is a platform for arbitrage trading. Market makers can continually make and adjust offers for exchange between two currencies. These offers will be used to find a ""path"" between two currencies when a payment needs to be made.

A native currency (XRP) is also introduced to make it easier for two currencies to be exchanged. When, f.e. there are only few people exchanging Korean Won and Madagascar Ariary, fees can be high to pay someone in Won while you only have Ariary. But as more people adopt Ripple, in both countries market makers will be trading Won for XRP and Ariary for XRP (making money on the margin fee) so that when you want to pay Wons with your Ariary, Ripple will find the cheapest path from Won -> XRP -> Ariary automatically.Ripple is a platform for issuing, redeeming, holding, transferring, and trading arbitrary assets. You don't need anyone's permission to use Ripple and transaction fees are much, much less than a penny.

Because Ripple payments are atomic and either succeed completely or fail completely, you can safely use other people's liquidity to facilitate your payments to mutual benefit. So if you hold gold and need to pay someone a Bitcoin, you can atomically sell your gold to get US dollars and use those US dollars to buy the Bitcoins, delivering them to their destination with no fear that you will get stuck with dollars you didn't want.

Ripple Labs is working to attract gateways and market makers to Ripple to form a pool of liquidity that will make cross-currency and cross-issuer payments cheap, fast, and reliable.

The vision is a ""value web"" that moves funds over the Internet as easily, quickly, and powerfully as information moves today."

Also, I'm happy to help you out personally if you write into support@ripple.com.

Cheers,
AnnaThis is Denis from SnapSwap. Due to increasing traffic we have rebuilt our BTC processing engine. The new system will process incoming and outgoing BTC transactions as fast as the Bitcoin protocol will allow. We have been testing the new system over last week,  monitoring performance and security. Some transactions were delayed. Occasional delays may still occur over the next week. 

You can check the status of any transaction here:

Contact support@btc2ripple.com if you need assistance.Did you set up a trustline to Snapswap from your ripple account?   If you don't have a trustline big enough to hold your Bitcoin balance, I think that could be your issue.A friend of mined had to wait for 22 confirmations. I'm sure it'll arrive, just stick around. But yes, SnapSwap is very slow.

I received some XRP for them to activate my account I guess?

"" ~snapswap-xrp-hot sent you 26.000 XRP""

It's the same code as rippletrade.com, since they both run wholly client-sideBTC2Ripple service has become slow over the past weeks. It was pretty much 1hr (6 confirmations) before. I guess this is due to increased traffic. I have been using it before it starting slowing down. You would not be receiving XRPs but BTC.snapswap IOUs instead. When you get the BTC IOUs, you would then need to trade it for XRP.I use snapswap and Ive transferred successfully from bank to snapswap to ripple usually clears in 4 days. Ive never withdrew from ripple to snapswap though, has anyone here?I've had much better luck with [Dividend Rippler](https://dividendrippler.com) for dealing with bitcoin.SnapSwap is a *little* slow from time to time, but maybe that's a sign of competence. It's a lot better to be slow but accurate, than fast but unreliable. I experienced quite a delay in depositing USD to SnapSwap b/c I sent them a paper check via online billpay, rather than a wire or ACH (not a feature offered by my online checking acct). I was rude to the SnapSwap customer service lady, but in retrospect, they are doing an amazing job at dealing with this volume. SnapSwap is quickly becoming THE Ripple gateway, and that without any famous VC backing or other hype. I would not be surprised if SnapSwap becomes a more valuable company than Ripple Labs over time.I am having problem on how to open SnapSwap account i send my identification to them still yet they refuse to open account for me any one can advice why thisYou didn't get scammed by anyone.

2014-11-17 04:26:34;On Ripple Charts, why are orders unfilled when bid and ask match?;"It's usually a rounding/precision issue.   I was confused by this as well.  

It'll look like the orderbook is 0.00851 - 0.00851, but it's really just cutting off digits from showing 0.0085115 - 0.0085121 or something like that.

If you click on a number in the order book, it will auto-populate an order ticket with the price listed to a lot more significant figures.   Perhaps there is some lag on the orderbook update. When an Offer is created that can fulfill another existing open offer, they fulfill each other by automatically.

Short answer, no, not always. If it did, then how could you peg one asset to another? Say you have a ""dollars"" assets and a ""cents"" asset that you issue. You want to place 100-to-1 offers in one direction and 1-to-100 offers in the other direction to maintain the peg. How would that work if the offers always cancelled each other out when the rates matched?

But it's unlikely passive offers are the issue you're seeing. Most likely, it's precision as kakkaww said."

2014-11-27 02:41:35;Why is Ripple exploding in value under heavy volume?;"To answer the OP's question, it works like this:

Anyone who wants to can introduce an asset in Ripple, in any amount and in any denomination. You can think of this as an IOU. Because such an asset could be worthless, Ripple requires people to agree to hold an asset before they can hold it. So if you agree to hold USD assets issued by me, I can pay 1 USD to you. Ripple will then reflect that I owe you $1.

That alone isn't very useful until you add gateways. Gateways are businesses who make it their practice to enter into issue and redeem on demand agreements with their customers. Bitstamp, for example, is a Bitcoin gateway. If Ripple says Bitstamp owes you 1 Bitcoin, you can ""redeem"" that IOU with Bitstamp and get a Bitcoin. If you send 1 Bitcoin to Bitstamp, they will create a Ripple entry saying they owe you 1 Bitcoin.

Because Bitstamp is reliable and trustworthy, many people value their IOUs at face value. True they should have some risk discount because Bitstamp could go out of business or something could go wrong in the redemption process, but they should also have some premium because you can do some things with them that you can't do with a Bitcoin. To make the system work, most of us pretend these cancel out. (Just as people didn't weigh every silver dime and just accepted any basically intact dimes as worth the same.)

Now, this alone wouldn't be all that useful except for three things. First, Ripple can hold not only these IOUs but also offers. That is, a person who holds one asset may be willing to trade it for another asset. Second, Ripple can support atomic operations that exchange currencies and make payments that either succeed or fail as a unit. Third, Ripple has a pathfinding system that will act like a matchmaker to find the way to use the asset of your choice to pay someone else the asset of their choice using all the liquidity available in the system.

So, essentially, if I want to get money from country/currency/system A to country/currency/system B, Ripple can match me with someone who is willing to move from B to A (or some combination of people that has the same effect) to make my payment work.

Ripple is a currency-agnostic platform for issuing, redeeming, holding, transferring, or exchanging arbitrary assets. Assets are issued and held by cryptographic identities and the system does not require any central authorities to function.

Ripple also has an internal crypto-currrency (called XRP or Ripples) that is a counterparty-free asset that can be exchanged between any two Ripple accounts.anyone buying ripples now, this is a very dangerous game you are playing. XRP is being pumped on cryptsy and the reason behind all of this is becasue people like me who now want to sell xrp for btc have no liquid way to do so.... crytsy is very cleverly blocking all xrp deposits , meaning people can only buy coins , nooone can deposit and sell XRP at the moment , this seems to be pushing the prices upValue in Ripple can be in the form of balances with third parties (""IOUs"") denominated in any currency, or it can be in the currency ""native"" to Ripple, called ripples or XRP. The latter is not a debt and is not subject to counterparty risk. Because they're abstract like bitcoins, their value floats and is determined by the market. As with all such markets, it is very difficult to say exactly what is driving any change in value, other than ""people want it"".This is a part of overall move to crypto 2.0. Look at http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/views/all/, from the top 10 currencies only 4 are old versions( BTC, LTC, DOGE & DARK). Everyone else is a 2.0 chain with features above & beyond payments.So what exactly arey ou purchasing then on the exchange? XRP?

If i bought 10,000 XRP what exactly can i do with these XRP? I can't seem to get my head around Ripple!Hyper-simple explanation: anything that can be a digital 'unit' can go into Ripple and be exchanged for other units representing stuff. This is by nature an IOU since the unit of account is not the thing itself. If I have two pineapples, I could float two Pineapple IOUs onto Ripple. Each unit means 'I owe you' whatever amount of something. The single exception to this rule is XRP (or 'ripples'), which are not an IOU for anything else, but are digital units intrinsic to the Ripple network's functionality. There are a finite 100 billion of them.This is a 100% pump. 

Think about it. Where can you use XRP?If you go on ripple charts right now everyone and their mothers are buying xrp left and right

2014-12-14 16:12:20;Question: Can Ripple replace the current Bitcoin exchanges if banks start working with Ripple?;"Yes.All you need is an entity acting as a bitcoin gateway (issuing and redeeming bitcoin balances on Ripple) and an entity acting as a USD gateway. Then users holding USD balances will be able to trade them through Ripple with other users for BTC balances and vice versa.It will be able to fill that same function..  It will probably be simpler for most folks to go to the bitcoin brokers though, than to learn how to use ripple, and Bitcoin bridges etc..  

Ripple doesn't appear to be trying to tackle the consumer market --  They are after commercial business.Ripple-enabled Banks vs. Bitcoin exchanges: 
It's unlikely banks will provide Bitcoin-related financial services to their customers. A possible exception is Fidor: http://about.all4btc.com/fidor-dream-bank-bitcoin/

Ripple-enabled gateways vs. Bitcoin exchanges:
It's also unlikely Ripple will replace Bitcoin exchanges. Rather, Bitcoin exchanges can integrate with Ripple to become more competitive. LakeBTC is a good example: http://www.coindesk.com/lakebtc-users-bypass-bank-transfers-ripple/. Bitstamp is also integrated with Ripple."

This is a strong premise to start out with that I still can't completely reconcile, even if I agree with many of the points made. Perhaps of most importance from this article is his ""post mortem"" analysis of Quark. Security should be the number one feature of the ""next generation"" of cryptocurrencies. 

[Most interestingly is this website featured here. It shows the prospective price of killing Bitcoin. Forever. There are quite a few powerful people that have the kind of capital to make that move.](http://www.coinometrics.com/bitcoin/brix)"
2014-12-13 10:17:48;How decentralised is Ripple?;"Ripple is not decentralized. It is centralized. Basically that created a shitload of coins and gave the public a portion and can flood the market with their reserve any time they want.  The ripple protocol is genius though if you view at them as a company.  I have a few and their ability to send any currency and commodity instantly is badass.Ripple the protocol is decentralized..  You can run validation software on your machines if you would like.  There is no incentive to do so aside from your kindness however..  

So, theoretically Ripple labs doesn't control the network, but in reality, they probably do.   The company and it's founder do have significant holding of XRP and do have the power to dump them onto the market - and this is a real concern particularly since the founders have moved on to other ventures..   They probably have no capacity to raise the price however..  

Ripple is powerful and cool.   The distribution of the currency is probably the biggest talking point against it --  But for the most part XRP isn't a speculative instrument, so it really shouldn't matter..  The point of ripple it to transmit value from one currency to another and from one gateway to another -- and it does that well no matter what the price or politics.."

The protocol is not centralized, it's distributed (consensus). You can run your own rippled and gatewayd. Ripple Labs does run the majority of 'validators' although you can run one yourself as well.
Does anyone know if you can also run a desktop client for Stellar?Ripple is semi-centralized, similar to how DNS works.

At the root is set of well known validators, all owned by Ripple Labs (or their partners)

Beneath are the caching and relay servers ( I run one for example), which help the network scale.

The true test would be when (if) a rift opens between the community and RL resulting is several competing sets of validators. The network will most likely fork, proving a cheap source of endless fun for all parties involved."

The guy on the other side of the planet (B) needs to trust you (GW) for up to the amount that he is receiving from your friend (A). If B doesn't trust you (GW), there is no way he can receive your IOUs.

Example: Some guy in Pakistan says he wants to pay you in USD.PakiGateway. You want to be paid in USD, but you have no clue who PakiGateway is and therefore will not set a trustline to receive USD.PakiGateway. You tell the guy in Pakistan,""Please pay me in XRP or USD.bitstamp or USD.snapswap only. Thank you.""I would also like to add on that in a real case scenario, that conversation wouldn't likely be taking place. You would be able to still get your USD.bitstamp or USD.snapswap through bridging via XRP, or rippling through market-making functions.[deleted]You know a dollar is a real dollar because you only agree to accept dollars issued by someone with whom you have a ""redeem on demand"" agreement. Ripple's network rules ensure an asset can only be held by someone who agreed to hold it. There is no way to give someone an asset they do not want.

When he tries to send money to a friend on the other side of the planet, pathfinding attempts to find a way to trade some asset he holds for an asset his friend is willing to accept. If he doesn't hold any asset that's sufficiently liquid, then the payment won't be possible. Payments atomically succeed or fail, so you can't get stuck with an intermediary asset."
2014-12-26 22:09:06;"Stuck at ""Scanning accepted currencies""";"There's no way you can send XRP to Bitstamp. 
You just can send BTC.Bitstamp / USD.Bitstamp (and I guess also EUR.Bitstamp. I didn't try that one)."
2014-12-25 20:08:06;What advantages does ripple have over bitcoin?;"You can put any asset into the ripple network  --  It's strength is that if you want to send USD and have the recipient receive Mexican Peso's or Japanese yen  -- That functionality is more or less built in to the Ripple network - while it is a pretty big job in Bitcoin..

Ripple isn't really a head on competitor with Bitcoin - They are more tangents of one another.   
The ability to send and store fiat means you're insulated from any new kind of exchange rate volatility.* built-in currency exchange
* no need to mine
* alias system (users known by nicknames rather than gibberish numbers)
* ability to issue your own IOU (aka colored coins)

And if this ain't enough for you - check out NXT :-) (which also does private messaging, stock / asset issuance, digital goods marketplace, and very soon voting and side-chains (they call it MS) ) The primary use of Ripple is to trade debt.   Some party (Snapswap for example) owes me  100 USD - and I trade that 100 USD of debt for a different debt of 100 USD worth of Bitcoin at Bitstamp for example.  

That is substantially different than Bitcoin -- Where I am just passing my bitcoin to you and there are no third party entities at all..  XRP itself works a lot more like Bitcoin  - but it tends to be used primarily as an underlying currency that can pass debits and credits like AC current via various members of the trustline to exchange this debt for that debt..  

I think the main advantage is probably the existence of atomic, cross-currency payments with a built in, provably fair offer/trading system. This is what makes it possible for Ripple to federate payment systems.
https://wiki.ripple.com/Federation_protocolSaying that Bitcoin is 'HTTP for money' is like saying that using the Internet requires everyone in the world to use a 1995 Toshiba desktop and to browse only in Esperanto. 

Ripple is actually closer to this concept of a protocol layer for the Internet of value. Ripple doesn't restrict you to a clumsy technology or restrict you to a single medium.

Here's an example:

Bitcoin doesn't work with the current financial ecosystem - it makes it worse: Unless BTC replaces every single store of value, it will never succeed. If this doesn't happen, Bitcoin - whether 'the currency' or 'the blockchain' - will always add costs to financial transactions. Bitcoin not only makes transactions slower, but adds unnecessary costs and risks to what we have today. Replacing the existing system would undo literally thousands of years of progress.

Ripple does work with the ecosystem - and makes it better: Since Ripple was designed to accommodate existing stores of value, it can work with existing players - including banks and governments. 'Stores of value' include not only currencies, but securities, commodities, and any other asset. 

That said, Ripple and Bitcoin are compatible. Since Ripple is asset-agnostic, one can transfer BTC via Ripple. Not only that, but a BTC transaction via Ripple is cheaper and faster than a BTC transactions via the Blockchain.Ripple also has a rather natural role for the banks --  As Gateways...  The gateway still hold the physical assets-- Be it Gold, or USD or Yen etc..  While bitcoin is more or less bankless in philosophy.   The ripple network trades IOU's held by gateways."

2015-02-01 23:05:45;Is btc2ripple ever going to respond?;"Over the past months I have had BTC2Ripple delayed 50% of the time. Most often on weekends. So that is a norm for them. The longest I had delayed was 2+ days as I made a deposit on Friday and it got stuck. They usually come back to manually clear the transactions on Monday. So far all my transactions went through, even though I was as pissed as you each time it got stuck.

KYC is compulsory. I guess your previous transactions on Snapswap plus your current BTC transaction - combined exceeded 10BTC. If you don't want to send them a copy of your passport, then I guess other I.D of sorts should do. Some gateways also require a proof of address. I believe if you really don't want to go through the KYC process, they would return the BTC to you. You can mail them and wait for a reply this coming work week. There are many people's BTC stuck this superbowl weekend. I see many complaints on forums. You're not alone. =)I remember when I sent a few bits to my btc2ripple account and it never showed up, then I learned that the minimum I could send was 0.001 BTC. I never bothered contacting them about it since it was only like 10 bits. But the 10 BTC limit and withholding your coins is illegal IMO.
Their TOS states ""Before you fully verify your identity with us, your transactions are limited to the total volume of 10 BTC.""  So, they are asking you to comply with the TOS which you agreed to when you registered with btc2ripple.

AML and KYC laws are only going to get stricter.  If it's worth 4.28 btc to you to stand on principal and not comply with AML/KYC, then that's your choice.  You are not a victim.  Quit whining!I agree with the other commenters.  The OP should read the TOS more carefully.  Their AML policy likely requires them to KYC customers above 10BTC.  Last time I used the site, this was pretty clear.  The OP must not have understood the disclosure.

I would encourage the OP to upload their identity info.  It's not that big of a deal.  Basically all financial sites do it. It's funny that he's willing to send $1k, but not give identity data."

2015-02-08 00:34:38;Point of XRP?;"Every Ripple transaction consumes a tiny bit of XRP.  This was designed to reduce spamming transactions.  That might be XRP's only true purpose, to cover transaction fees over the Ripple network.It's essentially a security in the network. The expectation is that it will rise in value as Ripple is used more, just as equity in a company would. It's primary use is fund raising for Ripple Labs.I think I am somewhat accurate in the analogy -- somebody correct me if I am wrong.  

I like to think of the ripple protocol as AC current..  Debits and credits are passed through the network in a manner in which all the intermediaries within a trust line get offsetting debits and credits and the gateway balances are the endpoints - and they get traded from one user to another..  So if my  trusted friend wants Yen and your trusted friend is willing to sell them yen for Bitcoin and you and I trust one another - I we can pass XRP back and forth between us netting to 0 and our friends can trade balances on the ends..  

If this analogy where to hold, XRP would be like the electrons..  Different parts of the network may not trust certain gateways, and we may not deal in certain currencies, but we all use XRP.

The price is what it is.  I don't think the price effects functionality much at all..  XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network—you need some to activate your account and every transaction consumes a tiny bit, as a security measure.


XRP is the only true asset on Ripple; everything else is an IOU issued by gateways. Your deposit of $20 at a gateway means that gateway owes you $20 USD, the same way when you write a check to a friend for $20, you are making your bank owe him $20. Anyone that trusts that particular gateway’s IOU will accept it as if it were actually $20 USD.


Using a gateway requires creating a trustline at that gateway for a particular currency.

While it’s great that every user of Ripple can transact in whatever currency they wish and have it automatically converted to a different currency on the receiving end, no matter what, we can transact using XRP to settle payments. Using XRP doesn’t require gateways or trust lines–you can just send or receive it directly, just like bitcoin."

2015-02-11 15:27:26;Why is bitcoin the only Cxyptocurrency on the Ripple network?;"Yes, ripple can be used to exchange any asset (that is, a gateway-backed IOU that represents any asset).  But ""efficiently"" is another matter.  If there's no liquidity (i.e. other market participants willing to trade the asset), then this greatly impedes asset exchange.    
To bring any asset into the ripple network, including any altcoin, you need 1) a gateway that will issue IOUs (i.e. ripple digital assets)  and 2) user and gateway trust such that users are willing to transfer outside assets into ripple network IOUs via these gateways.  
I would also add a third requirement (related to #2), which is the need for market makers providing consistent, reasonably-priced liquidity.  Although the popularity of a given asset has a big impact on liquidity, even the most liquid assets in the world (e.g. S&P 500, forex EUR/USD, etc...) rely on dedicated market makers whose sole purpose is to facilitate transactions by providing liquidity on both sides (and get paid for their risk exposure and service by collecting fees, usually in the form of spreads).  


For #1, probably many existing gateways have the capability to issue IOUs for altcoins, but there still has to be enough demand/trust for that to take-off.  My guess is there's just not much demand for altcoins, and because of the extreme volatility of altcoins, it's very risky for gateways and market makers to facilitate exchange.  


Demand/liquidity can be a chicken-and-egg problem.  Lack of liquidity results in less interest (spreads are too wide, too much risk of being stuck holding an asset), and less interest means less liquidity.   Ripple Labs has rightly focused a lot of energy on this chicken/egg problem and has had a concerted effort to recruit professional market makers to provide liquidity on the ripple network.  

Out of curiosity, what altcoins do you think would be useful to exchange on the ripple network, and why?  What's the use case?  Trading/Speculation, or something else?  Have you looked at the lists of gateways?  There are quite a few AltCoins available.. If you find the right gateway.  

I exchanged my gifted Stellar on Ripple for XRP...  

Bitcoin is in fact NOT the only Cryptocurrency on Ripple. There are several of them, the problem I have seen is that most all of them have such low volumes they are not attracting new users. The ripple network is a little difficult to wrap your head around at first too. The ripple network is more or less built to convert different currencies and not cryptocurrencies. You could technically send someone in Japan your USD from USA on the ripple network and they could withdraw in JPY  with low to no fees. 
Take a look here at ripplecharts, you can see right away on the drop down menu LTC as well.

2015-02-09 15:46:06;How would CoinBase exchanging XRP effect Ripple?;"If coinbase became a gateway, we would likely have a better gateway than snapswap/btc2ripple for moving bitcoin within ripple.  It would light a major fire under the speculative market for XRP -- we'd see a lot of volatility.

I asked coinsetter's CEO if they had looked into becoming a ripple gateway, and he indicated that they were considering it.

I have sent out a lot of XRPs to noobs, but decided that everyone should get their starters like I did -- by registering with a gateway (e.g: snapswap).Probably it would be even easier to get XRP I guess? RippleLabs is not an exchange by the way, Ripple itself is.

XRP value is mostly a non-issue (unless you want to speculate on them), if you want to buy larger amounts of XRP you'd anyways need a gateway - and they usually offer starter XRP for free or at market rate."
2015-02-18 19:03:26;The rise of fiat-denominated cryptos;"With bitcoin, increasing adoption necessarily implies increasing exchange rate (while the velocity is flexible, it would not be able to grow arbitrarily large). The *worthy* aspect and the *speculative* aspect are merged together, and that is how it can become valuable and it can be used to incentivize its network security.

With those ""shares"" (bitshares or nushares) this is no longer the case: the *valuable* is separated from the speculative *share*. Therefore, *storage of value* and *payments* are done on the fiat-based coin, while the *shares* become practically worthless (indefinitely following speculative pump and dump cycles). In my view, these *shares* are not able to incentivize enough the network security, which seems too much relying on goodwill (either checkpointing/dev centralization or delegating the block generation).

RippleTrade (or Ripple Labs for that matter) can't help you there, the payment already happened (correctly and as you entered it) and Bittrex now has your money. It is up to them to fix this issue and credit your account correctly or to put the blame on you and tell you that you need to check twice in the future...

I'd recommend using at least one to two digits as error detection code in destination tags, lots of gateways don't seem to have very smart policies regarding them (e.g. making them sequential...). This is up to the gateway though.

It is weeked right now, hopefully Bittrex resolves this issue next week. It's not like they have 50 transactions per second coming in anyways, so I hope for you taht everything can be sorted out."

UBI would only work with fiat currency because you can create demand for it by force.

The author seems to give a nod to this idea in the paragraph titled ""alternative savings currency"" and correctly identifies it would have to be a country making policy decisions similar to the way countries choose to inflate and nobody can do anything about it. The argument then just becomes two separate issues of 1) having a country adopt a sensible UBI policy and 2) having a country use crypto for its currency.

My favorite explanation of this concept is given in the analysis of freicoin here:  http://themisescircle.org/blog/2013/08/22/the-problem-with-altcoins/

>  Freicoin is an idea whose time will never come. Since it rebukes buyers, it resists ever having value. Freicoin is thus not so much a scam but more an abortion.

We have more power than any might realize (i.e. bitcoin and ripple sub-reddit voter-aggregate). I can't count how many times a controversial blog post is voted up on /r/technology , then major news networks start picking it up like Reuters and BBC.

A socio-techno-economic consideration: I know IBM has gone through tough times in the last couple of years, but why would IBM go through all the trouble of copy-pasting source code created, maintained and refined by the Bitcoin foundation, then go through testing (inevitable given specific corporate and government client needs), pay for all that development to integrate when Ripple for example is already 90% built?  (Fidor and CBW  banks have announced they'll use Ripple, so its ready for primetime)...all to publicly risk their reputatation. If they are merely forking, alot of people will be pissed as you rightly are. "

2015-03-14 12:56:52;Is there development for a Trezor, btchip and Ledgerwallet like Ripple Multi-Currency HD Hardware Wallet?;Even though Ripple wallets are not ready for mainstream users it would be initially used between financial institutions and they would demand such hardware security.These are really REALLY niche hardware solutions... maybe something like smartcard based private key stores might be useful, or something based on Yubikey (but that seems to be rather focussed on providing an authentification factor, not a key management solution).
2015-03-13 17:44:32;new to ripple, my thoughts so far;"Awesome, welcome Jay Davies!

First backup your data (public and private keys)! Save your secret (and public) keys as well as passwords on multiple drives (HDD, SSD, USB Keys etc), and store them in different locations (God forbid your place burns down). Ideally, drives that you store in a relatively open area are encrypted. You can buy USB Keys that have simple but effective encryption software built in.

Second, enable 2 factor authentication on your RippleTrade wallet. (Click the Gear in your account > Security > Enable 2FA) This means that even when you login using your encrypted password or secret key, there will be a second layer of security, which pings your cellphone with another request for verification. You receive an SMS, and you enter that number into the RippleTrade verify field. (This works better than Bitcoin.info/wallet by the way!) If someone (neighbor or hacker etc) somehow gets your USB key and finds your secret key, tries to log in to RippleTrade, they will ALSO need your cellphone to read the text messaged code, and enter that to complete the login process. 

This also provides a notification system as a bi-product. If you did not try to login to RippleTrade in a day or two, and you get an SMS from ""Verification Code for Ripple"", it's a pretty safe bet someone's trying to login to your wallet. You could then move your funds to another wallet, and import a fresh secret key [etc]. (i.e. It seems your previous wallet has been compromised.)Don't let them change the way their web wallet works or you might lose all 38,000 coins."
2015-03-11 04:39:32;What is the fastest way to fund bitstamp through ripple?;"I believe Americans can deposit USD via SnapSwap and then transfer the money through Ripple to Bitstamp.  However, the SnapSwap website says the deposit limit is $1000 per day, so probably not very helpful to you. Wire  the money to bitstamp or buy bitcoin in bulk from a private party, send them to bitstamp and sell them for USD. 

Shouldn't use snapswap, in addition to the daily limiti, t's no faster than wiring money directly to bitstamp, plus you'll pay a fee and when sending snapswap dollars to bitstamp through ripple there is an ""exchange rate"" between them that could add to the cost. 

Bitstamp was recently hacked for $5M, so don't keep money there longer than required. Dont use ripple.  They'll change the way their wallet works and you'll lose all your coins and they won't be able to fix it.   Pretty weak stuff."
2015-03-19 22:48:26;Is the US Govt. infiltrating Ripple?;"No.Ripple has been forming strategic alliances in a way that those within the crypto-community previously have not. Rather than ""disrupting"" the financial systems and setting themselves directly against governments, Ripple Labs is making the case that they are willing to work with and for an efficient and reliable product that is backed and supported by reputable people and institutions.

2015-03-17 15:02:00;ELI5 how Ripple is better then Bitcoin;"The two platforms overlap, but are fundamentally different.  Ripple is used to buy and sell IOU's of asset, using any currency.  It has markets built into the protocol.  

Ripple requires gateways --  Third parties that hold asset balances..   Bitcoin does not. But most of us have banks - and the fact that you don't need a bank doesn't mean that all banks are useless.      

The trolls always accuse Ripple of being centralized.   The protocol itself is not -- although the reality may be that ripple labs runs most of the servers,  that is only because You or I don't bother to download the client and run our own.  

Yes, anything Ripple can do could be built upon the Bitcoin Blockchain.   But ripple works now.  Using the blockchain for the sake of using the blockchain gets pretty Rube Goldburg pretty fast.. 

   **It is not?**

At least not in its current centralized state. If RL ever decides to decentralize the network (and I do not mean *rippled* nodes, but ledger validators) and distribute the XRP then, maybe, Ripple would become an unwasteful (no mining), quicker alternative to Bitcoin.

It also natively provides *colored* custom assets / IOUs and a decentralized exchange, directly integrated in the base protocol. While in Bitcoin, these are done as higher level applications running on top of it, and this has some disadvantages.

However, as long as Ripple stays centralized, it is nothing more than a fancy PayPal clone with unnecessary crypto overhead (now go downvote me for saying the truth).If you want to transfer 100 USD from Alice to Bob using BTC, you need 100 USD worth of BTC (about 0.35 or so at the moment) and it costs you a few cents in fees (you can get around this by risking that your transaction doesn't go through or takes a VERY long time. This takes about 5 minutes on average.

If you want to transfer 100 USD from Alice to Bob using Ripple, you need far less than a cent worth of XRP for the fee, the transaction clears within seconds and Bob actually receives USD, not a currency that he didn't want and has to sell first.

Then again, this just makes Ripple more useful in some cases, it is not very smart to compare Ripple to Bitcoin - Ripple is a payment system and decentralized exchange, Bitcoin is a currency. If you want to compare something, compare Ripple to Coinbase, BitPay, OKCoin, Kraken, Paypal... If you want to compare Bitcoin to something, compare it to native currency units like cash fiat, gold nuggets or WoW gold.eli5? Was this a question @promet11 ? 

In my opinion, Bitcoin's demise will be its lack of speed to confirm transactions. Most transactions over $100 or so take at least ten minutes to get a couple of confirmations (some take hours and you can NOT maintain a business on ""I give you my product now, and your payment will be confirmed long after you leave""). Ripple is instant, test it out and see for yourself. The online world is really only conducive to the fastest service. Think about what you do if a website takes too long to load, you leave, right? When bitcoin regulars start using RippleTrade, it will be hard for them to go back to lengthy confirmations, especially when late adopters start leaving the bitcoin wallets behind too. 1. Less wasteful: Intelligently designed consensus method eliminates energy consuming Proof of Work mining. By using federated validating nodes with progressive voting rounds Sybil and Finney attacks are eliminated.
2. Speed: 85% Confirmations are <7seconds 100% <10seconds vs 50% in 10 minutes.
3. Permission Gradient: The ""centralization"" bitcoiners whine about is a configuration limitation during beta phase. This is critical for early adoption institutions that prefer 100% permissioned systems which they can use without liability exposure associated with permissionless blockchains. This gradient can be adjusted by configuring validator list in coming versions allowing customized risk/security validator profiles including avoiding politically sensitive or financially driven conflicts of interest.
4. Integrated Exchange with Algorithmic Pathfinding: Ripple is not just a blockchain ledger, it is also a fully functional integrated exchange where any currency represented by a gateway's holdings with an IOU (colored coin) can be offered with any other IOU sharing mutual trustlines or more efficiently, directly to XRP the reference currency of the ledger. A pathway with the most preferable exchange rate between any pair on the network can then be found, allowing a previously unattainable scale of liquidity. This is main utility of the integral currency although it is also used as spam prevention and fee processing for gateways as well as being an investment vehicle for the protocol's developers and speculators.
5. Image not poisoned with criminal activity, rampant fraud, theft and multiple parties with liens on 'tainted' coins.It is really Apples to Oranges if you think about it. Ripple doesn't care if an r/bitcoiner buys ripple. ripple is for the Banks which have more than enough liquidity. [deleted]"

2015-04-22 01:34:20;Insidebitcoins.com: Not-So-Decentralized Ripple Freezes $1m In User Funds;"No different than a Bitcoin exchange freezing your funds (dollars or BTC) because of a pending court action. Even though gateways have the ability to freeze funds, I would consider the fact that Ripple funds are available on the public ledger quite a useful feature, and one that other blockchains are working to implement. If they can do so without allowing funds holders to freeze funds, more power to them. 

I would add that Ripple users are free to hold their funds at gateways that have the freeze flag off (cannot decide to freeze funds even if they wanted to), or in XRP, which cannot be frozen, much like BTC. Ripple supports three types of assets. The asset involved in this case is a type where the Ripple ledger reflects actual legal obligations on the part of the issuer of the asset. That is, if the Ripple ledger says, for example, that Bitstamp owes you 2 Bitcoins, that means Bitstamp believes it has a legal obligation to give you 2 Bitcoins.

For this scheme to work, the issuer must retain control so that they can make sure that the ledger continues to accurately reflect its legal obligations. In this case, the gateway was unsure what its legal obligations were and updated the ledger to reflect that, exactly as they are supposed to. Otherwise, innocent third parties could have traded valuable assets for an asset that didn't reflect an actual legal obligation. It's roughly the equivalent to a bank not letting its customers pay each other in counterfeit bills.

You are free to choose any issuer you like and can seamlessly make payments to, and accept payments from, people who choose other issuers. And if you don't like this asset model, there are two other asset models to choose from, neither of which give anyone the ability to freeze your funds.""not-so-decentralized,"" come on!  Ripple is centralized, and makes no pretense otherwise.  ""Freezing User Funds,"" well, when the User is Jed McCaleb, and if Jed was attempting to violate his agreement to sell his XRPs according to strict limitations -- hell yeah, freeze away!

I posted this so that the bitcoin-is-the-only-crypto-we-need crowd can drop in and reinforce their circlejerk passions.Title is misleading.  Bitstamp froze the funds, not ripple..

2015-05-22 02:34:48;Honest question: Is now a good time to buy Ripple if I'd like to invest in it? [Serious];"Dunno --  Crytpocurrencies are a pretty darn new market --  anyone who pretends to know is full of it...

What you do know is that you can only lose 100 percent of what you invest, and ripple certainly could go up significantly from where it is..  Don't invest more than you care to lose (Because you very well might) but the sky is the limit on the upside..  XRP has a few serious risks to its value. The largest by far is that 7.5-9% of all tokens are held by a former co-founder (Jed McCaleb) now estranged and openly hostile to Ripple Labs succeeding who is developing his own fork with his own design priorities and is trying to fund his new effort by selling his and other family member's XRP. He has been doing so with bots and may have been violating a lockup agreement he signed after he publicly announced he was going to sell it all. 
  
  The dispute has been brought to court and the lawyers are battling it out with motions and restraining orders. Until the dust settles on that situation its probably best not to put a bunch of your money directly into the tokens. However, it probably is a good idea to sign up with Rippletrade to learn how it works, pick a gateway like Snapswap, Gatehub, Ripula or Bitstamp and have a way to get money in in a hurry for when the legal situation gets resolved or the Western Union pilot goes live or the Rabobank rumors come to fruition or a Federal Reserve announces it will be phasing in an implementation.
  
 The bottom line is that Ripple has taken a pragmatic design path with its protocol which is more regulatory compliant and better politically aligned with how banks, wall street and government view and use money. Bitcoin set out with very specific libertarian ideals which it turns out are mostly incompatible with modern money and require offchain bootstrapping, complex workarounds and overly expensive security to function in ways Ripple was designed with from the getgo (currency agnostic, permissioned validation, no blocksize limits). Unrestricted, untrackable digital cash is far more useful for crime and corruption than solving large-scale, complex, global transfers of value - which is where the real money is, not at the anonymous privacy consumer level. The irony, is that if Ripple succeeds in becoming a broadly adopted protocol, compatible with bank and international transfer standards as a low-level settlement rail, it could succeed in becoming a universally accepted token of value, the upside of which ... is absurdly substantial. 
 So my advice: try it out with a deminimus amount (I have played around trading in and out with <1,000$) so that if the avalanche starts you'll be able to catch it on an upside instead of a few days late (KYC and bank account linking still takes 3-5 days)I think Ripple's value comes down to your opinion of the recent FinCEN action.  

I used to believe that Ripple would be ""bitcoin for banks.""  Banks have a real problem with settlement time and cost, especially cross border.  Ripple can solve this technically.  Widespread adoption by banks would likely lead to significant XRP appreciation.  

Unfortunately the action likely means that banks won't adopt Ripple, and that their long-term value is less clear.  I think they're just another altcoin now.

If you believe that it can get enough growth outside the US, then FinCEN likely doesn't matter.  If you believe banks will adopt anyway, then it's probably ok to.  If you believe it'll experience enough growth outside banks, then it's good too.

For me, I just sold all my XRP.  Just my $0.02.Take it from me [serious too], after discovering Bitcoin in early 2010 at $0.05, briefly thinking this is the future of finance, then looking at their website, focusing on my own business, I concluded how can an online currency possibly gain in value [?], I was obviously kicking myself in 2013.

You are much more likely to profit if you invest in something before everyone else catches on and discovers it. If you discover an entire industry before everyone else does... well the rest is history. But wait, the crypto market still has a heck of a lot more room to grow. I believe: Bitcoin is to Friendster, as a yet to be exposed crypto wallet is to Facebook.

I did not do some simple investing math in 2010 after discovering Bitcoin at $0.05 to think about the potential upside versus the potential downside for myself. Hopefully this helps your quandary. **Imagine you bought $1,000 USD worth of XRP**, then what's your worst case scenario and what's your best case scenario? Financially speaking [not psychologically]: **Worst case is that you lose your $1,000 USD**, the best scenario is that you buy now, then sell your XRP when the market hits its highest value as tech bloggers and journalists start writing 'bubble'. The calculation for the former is easy, but it'll take a bit more time for the latter.

**Let's run some numbers**

If you invest $1,000 to buy XRP at today's exchange rate ([0.006675](https://www.ripplecharts.com/#/)), you'd have about $150,000 XRP (International bank wire transfer fees and very ironically [if applicable] your local currency to USD exchange rate not withstanding). What does this mean in a growth scale context? You could run these basic numbers yourself for example if you bought $2,000 worth of XRP or $3,000 etc (don't buy more than what you're willing to lose). So now comes the hard [i.e. speculative] part, Ripple Labs recently started a pilot project with Western Union. The transaction market in the US alone is about $40 trillion dollars [coinbase]. The total XRP market is 676,600,000. or 59,000 times less that of the US transactions market (40 tn / 676.6 million). We know the XRP market will not take over the *entire* US transactions market, so let's be more conservative -- half of the US transactions market is 20 billion:

    20,000,000,000,000 / 676,600,000 = a 29,600 multiple.
    0.006675 (XRP value) X 29,600 (market size multiple) = $193

Keep in mind, there will be group think, and market psychology factored in here when the XRP market becomes widely known (ex: 40% of all US transactions are executed using the Ripple protocol via XRP tokens), so we'd have to give or take 50% of my speculative value here, so we're left with $100 USD, or XRP ends up at $300 USD. Now factor in the holdings example above, you'd have between $15,000,000 - $45,000,000 USD in your RippleTrade wallet.

If I've erred in my math, feel free to correct in a comment. In my mind, the numbers I've run here are the *maximum potential value*, so any valuation higher than this is just gravy.

There's a heck of a lot more to consider, like the speed of the Ripple protocol versus Bitcoin, lack of mining, integration of Ripple with banks, where Bitcoin seems to be more an initial experiment to kick off an industry, and of course Internet of Things: IBM and Samsung have partnered with Ethereum to enable any connected device to send micro payments (imagine your washing machine sends 2 cents to pay for one load of laundry). Crypto and blockchain technology will spawn unimagined industries, so I believe we're looking at many times a $40 trillion market, but that's probably best for a blog website. Ok, I've typed enough, I need to go outside.

[gatehub](https://gatehub.net/signin?goto=/user/home/?welcome=true) is a great gateway to buy XRPs from.  You can also get starter XRPs there (I believe they give you 5 euros just for signing up, and they convert some of those EURs to XRPs to get you activated.

There's also [snapswap](https://snapswap.us/#/signin), another gateway which can get you going.

I believe you may be correct, but, as you know, the biggest issue with ripple has been XRP allocation.. the system with have far more support if btc is the native currency instead of a private premine.. I believe btc is like tcp/ip and everything can/will be built on top of that network.It heavily depends on your definition of ""blockchain"" - Ripple uses nearly the same concept as Bitcoin to store transactions, only improved in some key areas (e.g. you only need the most recent ledger, not full history to know balances of an account).

Then again, yes rippling or markets in general will be very hard in a ""mined"" blockchain, where you have a little dictator for every block since there are monetary incentives beyond fees (which are burned in Ripple anyways) to assembling a block such as controlling transaction ordering. As soon as you don't just enter finalized transactions but also intents to transact/trade some time in the future, you're better off if you can choose ordering or take some of these offers yourself. Leaving this to a randomized single actor with a certain probability is not a good idea.

What would be REALLY interesting would be to extend rippled or other software to accept transactions with different anti-spam measures, such as a Bitcoin transaction taking place. This is probably rather somethign to complement Codius though or would be part of a Sidechain (which are just protocol-native automated gateways)..I know this is one of the prime focuses with the blockstream project."

RippleTrade will never hold your money. Your money is held by any gateway that you choose and trust. RippleTrade just allows you to trade using all currencies in your Ripple account that can be held by various gateways.
Trades happen with anyone on the Ripple network, most of them not even using RippleTrade themselves. This gives you a global reach across the complete Ripple network. When trades are executed, money flows from you to someone else in the network, or vice versa. No one except you can make Ripple transactions with the money in your account, not even RippleTrade itself.

Kraken on the other hand, holds all your money. Trades all happen in-house. When a trade executes, Kraken decreases your balance and increases someone else's. This means that the Kraken system manages all money. If there is a bug or a hack, Kraken can lose money and thus you can.

2. As long as the thief does not gain access to your secret key (e.g. because you encrypted your HDD properly). If someone gets access to that key, they are indistinguishable from you from the network's point of view.

There are no real ""online wallets"" in Ripple that I'm aware of, the client at rippletrade is also just a JavaScript client that only executes code locally and gets public information from servers (e.g. your trade history and balance). The downloadable client just does not run in a browser but in a packaged webkit environment, last time I checked.

4. No browser needed, probably no KYC needed in the future(?) but rarely updated and not as well maintained as rippletrade.

2015-06-02 03:00:08;Does Ripple intend to overshadow Bitcoin? Or coexist with it?;"It seems like a somewhat complicated relationship.

Technically, Ripple is mostly orthogonal to Bitcoin. They generally don't compete for the same use-cases. Bitcoin has a money-as-an-asset model, while Ripple has a money-as-debt model. It makes it possible to carry Bitcoin debt over the Ripple network, while there's no great way (and perhaps no point) to carry Ripple derivatives over the Bitcoin network.

Politically, it's blurrier. Ripple Labs has tried to position itself as an answer to the ""I love the blockchain, just not bitcoin"" types. That has required them to contrast the goodness of a centrally controlled network heavily dependent on trust, and now largely subject to KYC/AML regulations from the wallet down, versus the evil of Bitcoin's morally neutral protocol, its decentralized architecture and trustless design.  

For example, at the bitcoin senate hearings a couple years ago, you had an attorney saying gems such as:

> Bitcoin has also demonstrated a number of weaknesses that the next generation of virtual currency should be careful to address.  

or 

> Bitcoin has built its reputation and structured its virtual currency around being both antigovernment
and anti-establishment.

or

> There's also a virtual currency called Ripple that has started very differently from Bitcoin and started with the premise we are operating in an existing financial ecosystem, and we need to be able to comply with the criminal laws and anti money laundering laws that are in place.

Realistically, Ripple has a fraction of the mindshare Bitcoin gets, so it's not so hard to understand why the folks behind it would try to climb on its shoulders and push it down a bit in the process.

Since technologies don't have intents, Ripple doesn't intend to overshadow anything.  
Ripple Labs however is most certainly trying to become as successful as possible, and given a choice between coexisting nicely or dominating the field completely, I doubt they'd hesitate.

On that note, I've mentioned a few fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ripple, but here's one that's fun to think about a bit more:

Ripple the network is currently under the complete control of Ripple Labs, the young dynamic startup.  
When things don't work out, startups are known to ""pivot"", which means they change their business strategy to try to put themselves on a better path toward growth.

Bitcoin is unlikely to ever change drastically. The core devs agonize for months over changing the value of a single parameter, and even then, whatever they do only matters if enough folks using bitcoin actually decide to use their change.

Ripple in contrast has nothing stopping it from changing technically overnight. No risk of soft or hard fork. No users to convince. Just Ripple Labs and its business objectives.

That means Ripple could theoretically acquire more technical overlap with Bitcoin, and perhaps compete more aggressively as a result.  
(Which honestly seems rather unlikely to me at the moment, but it's not impossible.)
I think ripple is by and large a different beast than Bitcoin.   Both will have their place... 

Ripple is tool for trading debts...   Bitcoin is an asset...   That makes them different animals..  

Certainly banks and the like have more use for ripple than bitcoin -- Mainly because they are in the business of lending and holding assets..  Both , ripple is like MTA in New York City ant btc is like gold for the internet "

They have developed a [decentralized consensus by quorum network](https://twitter.com/stevenzeiler/status/611690465679642624) but kept node participation [permissioned](http://www.ofnumbers.com/2015/04/06/consensus-as-a-service-a-brief-report-on-the-emergence-of-permissioned-distributed-ledger-systems/) as of yet. The consensus protocol is not BFT, instead it heuristically solves the Byzantine generals problem by using a deterministic, append-only ledger (each round of consensus is cryptograpically identified and linked to the one before forming an immutable ledgerchain) and sequential rounds of increasingly stringent majority proportion voting by nodes of each node's Unique Node List. Failure to reach consensus does not fork the singular cryptographically identified ledgerchain, instead it simply fails to progress and is resubmitted until agreement is reached. Perpetual failure indicates a malevolent actor with >20% of nodes of not only a UNL subset but every possible subset and requires manual intervention resulting in a likely downgrade in node reputation. 
The genesis tokens are a centrally-held fixed supply not intended for direct consumer or even business use as a means of exchange for goods, instead chiefly functions as a [reference currency for the internal ledger and for spam control through automated fee controls](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/37270/what-purpose-does-xrp-serve-in-the-ripple-protocol) as well as fee collection for use of the network (must have a minimum amount to hold balances and trustlines, transactions cost a micro fee which escalates should spam attempts be detected). By having a native reference token for use solely on the network, XRP will usually be the shortest, cheapest and most liquid path between any two assets represented by IOUs, which makes it valuable for trimming margins in active Forex trading. That is where its value will be realized, when hedge funds and trading firms desire to hold large sums on a very active value transfer network in order to leverage capital flows.XRP, not much. In a lot of cases it's worse due to the centralised issuance.

Ripple system, however, is quite remarkable. 2 second full confirmation for atomic transactions. Built in incentives for Gateways, front running resistant consensus trading, etc.

> Next on the contender list is the venture-backed and well-marketed Ripple Labs. Whether this platform qualifies as a blockchain is up for debate, as transactions on the Ripple network are subject to the company's own moderation and management instead of network ""mining."" But what's certain is that the Ripple Labs project has turned to the ""centralization"" of its network management as a way to add features to Bitcoin.

> Five Ripple-controlled servers keep the heartbeat of this network in sync, which contrasts starkly with the many thousands of systems managing risk in the Bitcoin network.

Compared to... 3-4 pools having 51% majority in Bitcoinland: https://blockchain.info/en/pools

Full nodes are not ""managing risk"", they are just forwarding transactions and validating incoming blocks while replicating the results of others. Ripple has about 100 reachable full nodes running.

> Ripple Labs has needed to maintain this centralization in order to successfully promote itself as a next-generation competitor to payment clearing systems Swift and ACH. But it's apparent that this technology does not provide much in the way of immutability or settlement risk-reduction when compared to a conventional blockchain design.

Ripple's ledger is immutable, settlement risk is external to the system and (looking at MtGox for example) also abundant in Bitcoinland.

> Ripple throws out the need for traditional mining, by requiring that all actors in their system establish trust relationships with each other as well as trust in the Ripple Labs corporation itself.

This is not required, but reccomendable. Also ""actors in their system"" only would refer to the validation layer, not transactions or markets.

> By centralizing this trust, Ripple has exposed the entire network to risk in the form of an easy point of failure and censorship. This has resulted in the recent and very embarrassing court-ordered freezing of funds for one large digital currency exchange, as well as an anti-money-laundering fine levied by FinCen.

Nope, while Ripple Labs could have used their power over the network to simply deny the transaction that (in their opinion) did something bad, they asked Bitstamp to use their (Bitstamp's) power over their issued assets to freeze funds. This is like getting your account frozen by PayPal - your internet provider has no part in this.

The FinCen fine was for the sale of XRP which are a different can of worms and have nothing to do with Ripple Labs' control over the Ripple system.

> Within a conventional blockchain design, by contrast, value transfers are final. Neither a court order nor the whims of a small number of participants would be able to freeze funds or levy fines.

Ripple does not transfer assets (unless they are XRP), they allow to transfer balances/IOUs/issuances/whateveryoucallthem. This means even if freezing is not possible, the actual assets are still in escrow and can be denied at settlement time. Also freezing can be disclaimed permanently and irrevocably if you want to guarantee that you won't be able to freeze.

There is no way that someone can levy fines on the ledger (again: at settlement time is a different story, but that's external to the network) without a validly signed transaction by the owner of the balance/IOU/issuance/whatever.

> The centralized nature of Ripple highlights the settlement risks incurred by such approaches to blockchain technology. It now appears that any user of the Ripple network who needs to settle value amongst untrusted and/or risky actors will do so by way of … well, a Bitcoin gateway attached to the Ripple network.

Just like Counterparty, hm? Anyways, because the main risk in Ripple is settlement and counterparty risk is the exact reason why Ripple Labs is going after banks and other trusted insttutions that mainly have high trust in the community and relatively low risk values.

> While Ripple may offer some advantages over the incumbent Swift and ACH architectures, Ripple's architecture alone does not settle or route actual value outside the incumbent banking system. Meanwhile, as the Ripple community attempts to bridge its network to Bitcoin, so too has the Bitcoin community added many of Ripple's features straight onto Bitcoin itself.

Many features? Which exactly?"
2015-06-26 15:14:15;Why didn't Ripple protocol use bitcoin as the bridge currency?;"Ripple Labs funds itself primarily through the sale of XRP. Had they made the internal currency something they couldn't control, they wouldn't have had the resources to work as they are doing.Every currency in Ripple can act as a ""bridge"" currency. XRP exists to prevent spam/abuseThen it would be bound to the (relatively low) speed of Bitcoin transactions which additionally can be revoked, if a fork is created (a situation that can't really be created in Ripple).

It is definitely not nonsensical and it might be possible to use Bitcoins natively on Ripple e.g. by using Ripple as a ""side chain"" and the peg to this side chain as an automated, algorithmic gateway."

2015-07-08 01:44:07;How big is the ripple blockchain?;"Ripple does not work with a blockchain. It works fundamentally different.

Ripple nodes keep a ledger instead of a blockchain. The ledger contains the current state of the network, but no history at all. So basically all balances, trust settings and open offers. Every few seconds, nodes jointly construct an update to the ledger and use the consensus algorithm to agree on the correct new ledger. The last ledger agreed upon is called the Last Closed Ledger.

This does mean that ""forks"" are not possible. It is however possible for nodes to not disagree. The consensus algorithm luckily has some features that allows the network to cosntruct a new last closed ledger even when not all nodes agree 100%. Controversial parts will then be left out of the new ledger.

Ripple consensus works somewhat less distributed than Bitcoin block verification does. Every node keeps a list of other nodes it discovered (it's UNL or Unique Node List) and also keep a set of the nodes it trusts. When reaching consensus, whenever a node conflicts too much with your node's proposals, it will just be kicked. So this means that when there f.e. is a division between two groups of nodes that have a different implementation (version) and they fundamentally disagree, they will form two separate pools of nodes performing consensus entirely independently. They will have separate ledgers and there are no standard ways to recover other than just overwriting your ledger with the one from the other pool. As a client that does not participate in the consensus process, the ledger you interact with thus depends on the node you trust and you use to get your Ripple information.

So, to answer your question: Ripple nodes are not required to keep history of previously closed ledgers. They only need the Last Closed Ledger and the newly received transactions in order to participate in the consensus process. However, most Ripple nodes do keep a certain amount of historical ledgers in order to provide transaction data to clients that have been offline for some time. The nodes can decide themselves, based on the storage space they have, how much history they want to store.The fulll set of node data (ledger headers, inner tree nodes and leaf nodes) is around 1.5 TB at the moment.

Yes, 0-32569 are missing.

Ripple hashes not only transactions but also state, so to get a current view of the network, you only need the most recent ledger, not replay all transactions since genesis (like Bitcoin does for example).Getting every ledger is a long and slow operations. I don't remember how large it got last time I tried, but it was a respectable size (above 1gb, below 1tb, as a very rough order of magnitude.)

But yes, if you have the patience, you'll see the first few weeks worth of ledgers are just not showing up. Some kind of bug occurred and things got lost. I think a bunch of ledger were rebuilt after the fact, but some of it couldn't be put back together again.

Apparently, that doesn't really break anything, it just means we have no idea what happened in the early days."

So you can trade Bitcoin for dollars or yen or Gold, assuming there is an gateway institution out there that trades those items.   The ripple network automatically builds bid-ask markets and when you attempt to exchange the network automatically finds you the most efficient path to trade the asset you have for the asset you want.  

Ripplelabs is a US based company and does do AML/KYC, if you use their Rippletrade wallet services.  If you are moving more that 10k you ought to expect the government to be informed of you activities, just as you should with your bank..

Ripple itself is a open source decentralized protocol.   It won't tattle on you, aside from showing transactions going in and out of an address in it's ledger..   But there isn't a ton of software out there that is not from RippleLabs.   It is also noteworthy that Gateways are also AML/KYC complaint in many cases, and many of them are also going to want to know who you are to trade with you.

Right now there are not many banks on Ripple.   You generally have to set up an account with an gateway (Snapswap for example) to trade your USD for Ripple or use a cryptocurrency gateway to send currencies into your account.   Once you get money into your ripple wallet it is easy to trade it between currencies.  

So, all in all  -- Ripple is going to be good for thing s like I have USD in my bank and I want to send those in order for my Aunt to receive Mexican Peso's.

If you are in the business of avoiding 3rd party trust, Ripple really isn't for you -- It is a platform for moving third party account balances from one place to another.  This is counterintuitive to most CryptoCoin folks, but it is what it is and trusting a trustworthy party isn't really a bad thing...Ripple is mainly an exchange, not a currency... You could store XRP at Poloniex, Kraken or Cryptsy I think?""Ripple"" is the name for the protocol/network. I think you mean Ripple network's native currency - XRP. https://ripple.com/knowledge_categories/xrp/

XRP always exists online (so do bitcoins actually). You don't technically store it online or offline. What you store is the secret key that is linked to the public key (or address). The network/ledger keeps track of the balances belonging to each key-pair.

Public key (or address) - This is the identifier for people to send funds to and is the main identifier for the pair. You could say this is the address of the account.
Secret key (the other long string of digits and alphabets) - This is what is needed to access the account.

When you engage a third party to ""store"" your XRPs, what you are technically doing is creating a hosted wallet with them. The third party has a copy of your secret key and this is encrypted with a password that you make with them. Everytime you access your account with them, the password you key in opens up the secret key for use to open up your account on the Ripple network. So it is like using a key to access another key to your account.

Offline ""wallets"" can be simply seen as having no third party to keep your secret key. You keep that long key yourself either in digital or physical form. Using that single secret key, you can access your account directly to the Ripple network."

2015-08-05 02:52:05;Ripple is a [albeit very fast] public ledger based exchange, not a blockchain... right?;"Is it based on a type of blocks (data structures each linked to the previous block block through a cryptographic digest)? If so, it's a blockchain. Doens't mean it can't also be a decentralized exchange or something else.Here's how Peter Todd describes Ripple: ""As with Bitcoin, it consists of a set of chain of blocks...""

http://www.scribd.com/doc/271185330/Ripple-Protocol-Consensus-Algorithm-Review-Peter-Todd-May-2015It really comes down to precisely how you define ""blockchain"". It's kind of like arguing if an SUV is really a car. They're certainly closely related technologies, but they do have differences.Ripple saves the entire state of the ledger with every round of consensus and references the identity of previous round cryptographically forming a chain of data. As such, is it more of a ledgerchain than a blockchain, a blockchain only includes active transactions submitted, accepted and spent and the destination of its unspent outputs. Only a full node with the entire blockchain can then formulate a global picture of the bitcoin ""ledger"". Its rather quaint."

Despite their aversion to speculating in alt-coins, this is an option nevertheless. Ripple Labs claims to see their XRP tokens as just that, tokens, not a currency to invest in. However, this does not mean they could *not* give thousands of XRP to banks to develop applications / implement Ripple rails.

(I'd like to see the direct source of this, but anyway here goes...)

This is the secondary [source link](https://forum.ripple.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=7715)

Providing a futures approach where banks get the option to buy at a locked in price down the line is a good idea. However this is implemented, Ripple Labs would not lock up most XRP in their vaults ""just coz"".

2015-10-20 21:30:17;new user;Yes, you can buy XRP on exchanges. I bought some XRP on Cryptsy and withdrew it to my Ripple Trade account.

2015-10-20 18:36:57;Means of acquiring Ripple;"Ripple can't be mined because it's been ""pre-mined"". But it can be purchased. I've purchased Ripple (XRP) two different ways. I purchased XRP on a crypto-currency exchange and withdrew it to my Ripple Trade account, and I sent bitcoin to my Ripple Trade account through btc2ripple and then used it to purchase XRP. Ripple doesn't support a wallet any more, so I keep all of my XRP on my Ripple Trade account. Normally, you do not want to keep crypto-currency on an online account, but I think that is how Ripple contemplates it be done. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Others may have done it differently.I have Ripple in my Ripple Trade Wallet and am familiar with obtaining it by purchasing it, but currently there are no means of obtaining Ripple ""freely""? Ripple Trade is your Ripple wallet as is stated further down the account/wallet activation process. 

I wish there were other ways.. Why is it at a stand still and what exactly makes Ripple appealing as a currency in this scenario? 

And why would I spend BTC on Ripple? "
2015-11-01 22:45:36;Ripple XRP token - investment or commodity?;"The business model of ~~Ripple Labs~~ Ripple has changed many times since the start. XRP used to have a financial value within Ripple Trade and on some altcoin exchanges for speculators but the recent closure of Ripple Trade to new users and the new KYC requirements of existing users has nearly killed this value and speculator interest. The new Ripple business model is focused on providing solutions to banks and I can’t see any value in holding XRP and sold all my XRP earlier this year.Bitcoin has been ruled to be a commodity in the US:
http://www.zdnet.com/article/bitcoin-an-official-commodity-us-trade-commission/

XRP would surely also be in the same boat. 
As for XRP being a security though? The law hasn't worked that one out. In some respects XRP acts as a security, in other ways it doesn't. 

But the difference between Bitcoin and XRP is that XRP is issued by (and helps fund) a single company: Ripple Inc. Its a token emitted by a central operator. With any fund raising initiatives (even virtual ones), there will likely be obligations associated with disclosure/accountability etcQuoting Lord Katz - ""And with ILP, that's no longer an obstacle to XRP being used as a bridge currency for transactions involving assets they issue.""
http://www.xrpchat.com/topic/397-britto-locking-topics-that-question-xrps-future/?page=2#comment-2495

So ILP actually removes the issue of RCL being public, therefore seals the use case for XRP as a bridge currency for banks. This is a major step forward in firming up XRP's intrinsic value.XRP is not an investment.  It is not a security.  It does not represent ownership in anything other than XRP itself.  XRP is a cryptocurrency that is used within the Ripple Network as an anti SPAM mechanism and as a trustless base asset for bridging between other currency pairs.  The price of XRP is highly volatile.  Betting on its movement is purely speculation."
2015-11-01 21:08:19;Does the Ripple's Internet of Value Token - XRP - have value?;">There appears to be a fundamental disconnect between XRP valuation and Ripple organization""s business effectiveness.

You only had to listen.

http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/appcoins-are-snake-oil/

>On the other hand, the value of an appcoin can move completely independently of the value of the app itself. This is because the value of a currency is due to the value of the network of people holding it, which is a logically separate concept to the network using the app. The value of the app is a matter entirely of the service it provides, whereas the value of the appcoin partly due to the value of the app and partly to its competition with other currencies. If there are two currencies to choose, there is a relative disutility of holding the one which has the smaller market cap. The disutility becomes stronger as the difference between their market caps becomes greater. Apologies to readers, I should learn how to use the markup language. Text coloration is not as intended and several bullets are now embedded in paragraphs.I think its fair to propose RL change its intentions and communications with investors, but let's be honest, those of us who **speculate** on the value of XRP by buying thousands are not owed any prospectus.

Maybe you are getting impatient, not seeing movement, and this is a last ditch effort to see some movement, but it's going to fall on deaf ears -- unless of course you are a bonified investor.

I believe we will see an increase, but it will take a very large uptake, even big Western Union or Santander level promotions would not move the price if XRP much. The analogue example I'll give here is obviously Bitcoin. Bitcoin really started hitting INTERNATIONAL headlines when Silk Road was being covered, big compelling drug-related stories with hundreds of millions of dollars lost, the FBI hot on the tails of a mysterious ""pirate"". How were all these illegal transactions taking place? Bitcoin, what's that? Oh wow, this is different. Then you started seeing international headlines covering Bitcoin itself. 

Only in this level of exposure do you see real movement in value. It might still be another 2 years before we see an increase in XRP value of even 5 times. Long haul my friend... "

2015-11-12 22:25:22;Can't access my XRP anymore. What a rip-off!;"Rule number 1 in cryptocurrencies is STORE YOUR SECRET KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE!!!

Nobody has access to your XRP except the holder of that key.  Nobody.

Ripple Labs was warning for months via email and on Ripple Trade that they were going to implement KYC on their wallet.  You had all the time in the world to withdraw your XRP somewhere else or to trade out of it.  And you still have time - you just need to go through their KYC procedure like you've probably done every time you've opened a bank account, brokerage account, opened a mobile phone account, etc.

It's probably an expensive lesson for you but let me repeat what you should have learned from this experience: STORE YOUR SECRET KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE!!!In general, with any kind of crypto currency, your key *is* your money.  It's not ripples fault you ignored their instructions and didn't save your key.  That said, there may be a way to get your key using your password depending on a bunch of things.  Try contacting ripple about it, but I'd suggest being polite considering its your fuck up.See sections 2b and 2d of the agreement with FinCen.
https://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/pdf/Ripple_Remedial_Measures.pdf
Yeah the exact same thing happened with me.  I have the password but not the private key. ...which would have been enough until the fucked around all their stuff.   They can't help you get it back.  You are just fucked.  I only lost about $300 worth (well, lost in the sense that I can still see them but can't touch them).  

Sorry to give you bad news but it is ripple we are talking about here.  Blame others and refuse to take responsibility for your own inaction. Lesson therefore not learnt. Watch for a repeat.Not storing your recovery seed is stupid. Besides, I remember receiving emails about this almost weekly. They warned you that if you would not fill in some KYC form, you would lose access to your funds. 
So you were warned. I've always thought the approach ripple took to store credentials in a remote blob was a little iffy. It's not like bitcoin, because you don't have to store your wallet.dat locally, so it's easy to maintain the illusion of ""oh i'm just logging into my ripple online banking web site.""  
In fact, it's designed to feel that way. And it was likely seen as a competitive advantage, since it's a friendlier approach, it onboards users better, and it generally works great. As long as nothing goes wrong.

But what's really happening is nothing like an online banking login form where your credentials are little more than an arbitrary roadblock and can be bypassed at several levels should the need arise. And so users that are fooled by the slick user experience into believing they are on familiar ground are in for a rude awakening.

Of course, that the best answer to people getting burnt by unmet implicit expectations is literally [""Why won't it read!""](https://youtu.be/naQCHlyMxUg) is also unfortunate.

XRP acts like a middleman token which allows asset trades between third and fourth parties (etc).

Total **speculation** here: It looks like Ripple Labs is taking fairly extreme steps to evolve their platform and fintech protocol for big businesses. See users were required to disclose ID documents to continue using Ripple client, they then closed RippleTrade.

It is not completely beyond the realm of possibility that RL will shut down XRP purchases with a view to create artificial scarcity. They already hold at least 30% of all XRP and will do with all that what they will. If XRP purchases were blocked moving forward, its value for those few holding XRP will skyrocket.In my opinion they are phasing out XRP.  I have no inside knowledge but I don't think banks want to invest in a ""share"" scheme that common people hold and other people (cough Jed) can manipulate."

2015-12-23 14:19:28;I've been reading for a couple hours and have some questions.;"The concept of ""moving"" your funds or ""migrating"" is actually misleading and I believe shouldn't have been introduced to users by Ripple in the first place.  

Your ripple secret is the *only* way of accessing your account and as long as you have it, and no one else does, there will *always* be a way of accessing your account regardless of what wallets do or don't exist and regardless of whether you have previously set up to use them.  

The record of what balances your account holds are stored on the ripple ledger, which is public, and stored and maintained by the network as a whole.  Wallets are simply implementations of code that take your ripple secret, and use it to register transactions on the network / on the ledger.  These transactions are what send or trade your funds, and are the only way to affect your account balance in the form of a withdrawal.

To reiterate: as long as you have your secret key (the one beginning with ""s""), and no one else knows what it is, your funds are safe, and will always be accessible by you one way or another.  Maybe if you sit for a year or two, there will be different wallets around at that time, but all of them will still accept your secret key as a way of setting up that software for your use.  This is the only way a ripple wallet can function on the ripple network, it needs a secret key, in order to be able to do anything with your funds, and there is simply no other way.

Your public key (the one starting with ""r"") is just like a bank account number, it's a number that can be used to accept deposits to your account.

These concepts are extremely fundamental to the operation of the ripple network, and it is highly unlikely any of what I've described here will ever change.

A point of confusion is sometimes introduced in that many wallets will use a username and password to encrypt and decrypt the users ripple secret within the browser.  This can lead to a situation where the user mistakenly perceives the username and password to be the mechanism with which to access their funds, and so may come to depend upon the wallet provider if the user has not stored his/her own ripple secret.  In the case of the wallet provider shutting down operations and not continuing to maintain the database of usernames and passwords (and the user simultaneously not having stored their own ripple secret), the users funds may become permanently inaccessible by anyone, or at least that may become very difficult.

As to the future of XRP, Ripple Inc hold the biggest stake in it's future value, and continually reiterate their commitment to increasing it's value and have various plans for doing so.

2016-02-13 23:54:40;Where to find 'destination tag' on gatehub wallet?;"I believe the destination tag is the part of the address after ?dt. If you use the whole address as you have it above, it should work. Try transferring a small amount first to make sure that it works.There are no destination tags for GateHub wallets because you actually have your own wallet. Click on wallets and create a Ripple wallet. This will issue you a personal public address on the Ripple network. Then toggle to your Ripple wallet and look on the bottom left for your specific Ripple address.  

Your wallet address (on the bottom left of the page when in your Ripple wallet) is all you need to transfer XRP to gatehub. You need a destination tag for exchanges that don't issue individual RIpple wallets (BitStamp, Kraken, etc). Those exchanges issue IOUs rather than the actual XRP to your account. The destination tag identifies to whom they owe incoming XRP but XRP co-mingle with everyone else's XRP in the exchanges wallet. The address you posted is Gatehub's address, NOT your address. You'll notice that if you search for ""your"" Ripple wallet address from BitStamp or Kraken without the destination tag, it will show up as the wallet for the exchange. If you search for your wallet on Gatehub, it will simply show up as an individual wallet address but not Gatehub's address. You can search at www.bithomp.com/explorer or at heartbit.io/app

You can see gatehub's wallet here: https://bithomp.com/explorer/r9EUYx41zx3audeARUwpkDF7VuwcmbwYTUI believe GateHub supports both hosted and native wallets. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. With a native wallet, you do have your own destination address. With a hosted wallet, you use a shared destination address and you must include the destination tag. As wgcole01 said, the address you pasted has an embedded destination tag and should ""just work"" as is. The destination tag itself is the part after the ""?dt=""."

2016-02-19 06:07:54;About Ripple's future?;"In my opinion Ripple is currently best positioned to become integrated into the existing financial infrastructure. This does not necessarily mean that XRP will gain in value. And there are potential competitors on Ripple's heels (HyperLedger and IBM blockchain services). But note, Ripple is the only distributed ledger protocol currently in use by financial institutions to transfer real funds (Earthport, CBW etc). 

But why is Ripple currently better positioned than other cryptos/distributed ledgers? (1) They're addressing a real problem (2) they're not ideological about anonymity (3) they're paying very close attention to compliance.

(1) Ripple is focused on a very specific problem, real-time settlement (and even moreso, on cross-boarder settlement). The specific problem is that it takes a long time to send fiat (government-issued currency) from one country to another country. This is because fiat in banks is essentially a number in a ledger. Because banks in different countries don't share ledgers it takes a long time to verify that sending bank A has the funds before receiving bank B can release the funds to the payee without risk of default. This can take a long time even within a country. For example, why does it take 1 - 5 days to send money from your Venmo or PayPal account to a US bank account? Because they don't have a shared ledger. 

This is where Ripple (and other) distributed ledger technology comes into play. With a shared ledger you can nearly instantly verify that the sending bank has the funds, adjust the ledger, and make the funds available to the recipient. This cuts down on transaction time and fees because there's less risk.

In order to send dollars to a European bank you have to have someone willing to trade Euros for dollars and they're going to sell their euros at an advantage to them. These people essentially generate liquidity (available fiat). In this situation the difference between the Euro sell price and the Euro buy price allows these liquidity providers (Market Makers) to generate a small profit. One problem is that you may have currency pairs with low liquidity between them; how many people want to sell Kuwaiti Dinars for Brazilian Dollars? In this case you might not be able to directly exchange the currencies but have to take a path through multiple currency exchanges to end up with the desired currency. Each path incurs a fee because of the spread.

Ripple's argument is that by creating a native and tradeable asset (or currency) within their ledger, they can shorten the path between many currency pairs. Ripple's asset is XRP. So rather than going through 5 currencies conversions to get from Kuwaiti Dinar to Brazilian dollars you can take a shorter path: BRL --> XRP --> KWD. This means you pay fewer spreads and on the ledger this can still settle instantly. 

Well everyone wants the dollar right? So why can't the path simply go: BRL --> USD --> KWD. The answer is that it can, but even in this case the path through XRP might be cheaper due to variable spreads. Moreover, if widely adopted, XRP would likely be the most stable store of value because it wouldn't be vulnerable to local currency fluctuations.  You simply wouldn't need to worry about China deflating the Yuan etc.

(2) Ideology - many altcoins are hyperfocused on complete and total anonymity. There's a desire to create a parallel monetary system outside of the existing framework, one that does away with central banks. While this might be an attractive goal, it's unrealistic. Our monetary and regulatory system has evolved over thousands of years and has a built in system of justice, safeguards, and insurances. Specifically, banks in the US are FDIC insured. What happens if your bank is insolvent? Doesn't matter, the government has got your back. What happens if your altcoin is insolvent or goes bankrupt? Too bad. One can imagine that it becomes very difficult to insure bitcoin in an anonymous network because individuals can send money from their account to an anonymous account and claim fraud. In an anonymous network it's nearly impossible to insure funds because you can't discern theft from fraudulent claims. Without known parties it's hard to mete out justice when financial fraud occurs. It's hard to even know who the actors are. 

(3) Compliance - most banks won't touch digital currencies with a 10 foot poll without KYC, AML, and other practices in place. In order to integrate with the current, highly regulated, banking system, any distributed ledger system will have to open to adopt many of the same regulatory practices that banks do. Ripple has team members from the NY Fed and other regulatory agencies as well as a host of lawyers to vet their decisions and the integration of their technologies into banks.

Ripple is definitely not dead. XRP is likely not dead either. Ripple closed it's wallet service to (a) focus its efforts on building great technology and (b) limit their liability by getting out of the money service business. They want to be known as a technology provider, not a money service business. 

Ripple is still the biggest holder of XRP so they have a vested interest in seeing it succeed.

Ripple has been laying the groundwork for quite some time and there are a lot of indicators that Ripple will take big steps forward in the 2nd and 3rd quarter of this year. If neither Ripple nor XRP have improved by 2017, then I'd start to consider exiting my position. 

This was a lot but I hope this helped.Ripple focusses on regulation and that takes time but in view of the rest, they are well positioned. Also regulatory progress don't make good headlines so sometimes it feels that other currencies are making further strides in relation to Ripple.

It seems clear that before 2016 they were focussed on the tech and testing consensus thereby leaving their executives with not much on their plates (so news was slow). I see deals are picking up now which means that business development is gaining momentum in Ripple.

Ripple serves as a niche provider and caters to financial institutions. This may not be great for speculators as most deals will occur and may never touch/convert to XRP so your 'fiat' money could probably do better things right now with other currencies. 

The SBI deal opens Ripple to Asia which I believe is a big deal. Potentially integrating any digital currency deeply into a financial system helps it become omnipresent and goes a long way into developing an attitude towards savings on the digital currency. Which is good for price growth.The picture became clear for me once I separated Ripple from the others.
Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. are freedom fighters (against the banking system).
Ripple is an innovator to help improve the banking system.I think the chances are pretty high it will go nowhere. When all this crypto-blockchain stuff goes mainstream it wont be because the current systems are finally utilized and adopted. Big companies will just copy them and create their own separate systems.. No one can predict the future, but from what I can tell, the smartest people in the room (imo) have been keeping their distance from XRP, to put it mildly. The criticisms you listed are only the start of Ripple's problems. Can I ask, Why are you even asking this question? Not being confrontational, I'm actually curious. If you're new to cryptos, I suggest taking a hard look at both Bitcoin and Ethereum. I personally am also interested in Factom and Monero, but ... personal preferences. "
2016-02-16 15:33:42;How to store Ripple altcoins?;"So no one has actually answered your question fully... 

Right now you can establish a Ripple wallet at GateHub.net. They are endorsed by Ripple and are migrating accounts from Ripple Trade to GateHub. You'll need an actual Ripple wallet if you want to own and control your XRP. You can also download their wallet from github if you know how to code.

If you want to have access to XRP but aren't interested in the wallet then you can go to many major exchanges to buy and sell XRP IOUs. Kraken has great security but a horrible interface. Some people use Poloniex (I don't think they issues Ripple wallets) which has lesser security but a better UI/UX.

I'd recommend GateHub.net right now. You will get a Ripple wallet address and can write down you secret key. The secret key allows you to access your XRP should the exchange ever go down. If you have IOUs on Kraken or some other exchange and the site goes bankrupt then you won't necessarily be able to access your XRP.

Think of XRP IOUs like dollars in the bank. The bank OWES you the amount of dollars listed on their ledger as in your bank account. If the bank goes bankrupt or is insolvent you might lose the dollars that the bank owes you (unless they're bailed out). Owning XRP is more akin to having the dollars under your mattress. It doesn't matter if the bank you use goes bankrupt because your dollars are not IN the bank. You can only lose your value if dollars stop being use as currency, you lose your dollars to a natural disaster, or someone breaks into your home and physically steals the dollars (or steals your secret key in the case of XRP).

You can get more answers from knowledgeable people at www.xrpchat.comAre you sure you want to get some XRP?

Really really sure?

2016-02-28 08:34:20;What's the difference between Ripple's Interledger Protocol (ILP) and the Linux Foundation backed Hyperledger?;"It's still a bit unclear as HyperLedger has been acquired and may be pivoting a bit. My understanding is that:

-HyperLeder is looking to build a flexible and open basecode that can be used as a ledger BETWEEN a set of parties. They're interested in best practices and general distributed ledger logic.

-ILP is hoping to serve as a general protocol for communication regarding payments BETWEEN ledgers.

So, group A might have use HyperLedger(variant A) to trade and track stocks (think Charles Schwab) while group B might use HyperLedger(variant B) for point of sales purchases (PayPal). While the asset class traded by each group is different, they're using a similar ledger type utilizing ""best practices"". 

ILP would allow HyperLedger(A) to communicate with HyperLedger(B). So imagine you sell stocks on HyperLedger(A) and have $1000 USD. Today you have to transfer that money to your bank, then transfer it to PayPal before you can spend that money in PayPal's payment network. This is because Charles Schwab and PayPal don't share a common ledger. With ILP you could instantly transfer that $1000 from your CharlesSchwab ledger (A) to your PayPal ledger (B). 

Here's a slide show that walks through [ILP](http://www.slideshare.net/Interledger/ilp-webinar-102015-55230856).

Notably Ripple donated some of it's code to [HyperLedger](https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger).

Here's a bit more recent info on [HyperLeder](http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/?u=507eeacc70b9c89cdf4617cd5&id=fde6d823c9&e=b6b2bdcc60).

Ultimately it's unclear though, Hyperledger might end up competing with Ripple in the interledger space as [possibly suggested](http://www.coindesk.com/ibm-director-all-in-blockchain/) by John Wolpert the Global Blockchain Offering Director at IBM (which is collaborating with HyperLedger).

One the other hand, here's [a comment](http://www.xrpchat.com/topic/1029-interledger-but-possibly-not-ilp-is-a-necessary-component-of-the-financial-blockchain/#comment-9066) from a Ripple employee."

2016-03-03 21:01:50;With Ripple Trade closing what happens with the 20 Ripple deposit that was needed to open the account?;"Ripple Trade closing doesn't affect your access to your funds, IF you followed the instructions when you signed up, and recorded/wrote down your ""secret key"".  You can use this secret key to access your funds through another wallet service, such as gatehub.net which has been suggested by Ripple to use as an alternative.

As for the ""deposit"", it is your account reserve and some amount is always held in reserve in every account. Ripple doesn't have access to this and can't use it.  The amount required to hold in reserve fluctuates so one day it may be 20, the next it may be 40.  The point however is that it is supposed to be a relatively negligible amount for each account, that is still high enough to prevent people spamming and creating thousands of accounts for nefarious purposes.  If ripples became super valuable, the reserve would likely drop.Ripple Trade simply provides access to your funds, your wallet won't be closed, it will still exist on the Ripple network. By migrating your account you simply enable accessing your wallet through GatehHub.

Additionally, accounts on the Ripple network cannot be closed, once activated they are forever activated. Ripple hasn't decided whether they will create a function that allows users to completely close their account. Note, it is impossible to delete an account address from the ledger. When you ""create"" an account you're merely ""discovering"" a preexisting valid account public-private key pair.

Finally, the amount of reserve XRP varies and depends on the type of transaction you want to submit to the network."

2016-03-11 19:08:10;XRP accepted and this month we've featured a book that teaches everything needed in order to identify and take part in the next big thing;"No need to click the link if you don't want it. Here's a description of our featured product:

&nbsp;

“Give yourself a chance at becoming wealthy by discovering cryptocurrencies with great potential before everyone else”. The book is written by the main author from Gamblers United, with help from two other early investors and developers. After reading the first chapters you’ll be extremely up to date with all the technologies available at the moment when developing a cryptocurrency. It will even go over the ones that are theoretical and not yet implemented. The book uses modern retention techniques in order to make sure that you are actually able to use this knowledge, not just forget 95% of what you read after each page. I won’t lie, this is the hard part. Everything is well explained though and I was able to go through the information in the draft without losing hope. The authors debate which of these technologies offer the most value and try to rank them. Then the real fun begins: you’ll receive the rest of the tools and information that you need in order to identify the next hyper growing cryptocurrencies and support their bubble. Some will be worth pennies at the moment but will have huge potential of hitting it big. You will look at real life examples: things that have been done in the past in order to support or devalue cryptocurrencies; no one is talking about some of these methods. You will become an expert in the field. As part of the thesis that you are recommended to write while completing this book, the authors will lead you to analyze certain cryptocurrencies yourself and discover if you can spot the winners and the losers. Then they will put you to action to actually make money off the winners. But they won’t be winners forever. The competition is huge, new technologies appear all the time and some cryptocurrencies are not able to evolve fast enough. For this reason, it will help you decide when to cash out. Selling at the right moment is of extreme importance. The book won’t be an analysis of existing cryptocurrencies that are making obvious waves already (f.e. Ethereum), but it will also teach you how to look into existing dapps and see where there’s money to be made."

2016-03-31 16:09:19;Ripple Wallets?;"A wallet is like a safe in your house, you retain possession of your XRP and have access to it whenever you like. In US GateHub.net is really your only choice for a wallet right now. You can also get a wallet from xagate.com I believe but this will be much less user friendly. Ripula issues wallets but they aren;'t as popular as gatehub right now. If you're in Canada you can get a wallet from Bluzelle. And if you you speak Portuguese you can get on from Rippex.net. There are a number of Asian wallet issuers if you speak the language.

You can trade XRP on many exchanges but you're really trading XRP IOUs and don't hold the XRP in your own wallet (kraken, poloniex, bitstamp). Your XRP in an exchange is like like putting your XRP in a safe in a bank. Sure, you technically own it but you have to ask permission for it. The bank gives you an IOU which you can redeem for your funds.

Gatehub.net is an exchnage and trading plaform that connect your ripple wallet or account to the Ripple network. They do not hold your private key. Your private key is stored locally in-browser and transmitted to Gatehub after encryption. You can close your gatehub account and you will still retain full ownership of your XRP because you still own the secret key and wallet. 

Here is a tutorial on setting up a Ripple Cold wallet. XRPchat.com has more information about other downloadable clinets.

http://www.xrpchat.com/topic/1001-guide-to-create-hot-and-cold-wallets/Just remember that GateHub, the minimalist ripple client, and others are only interfaces to the Ripple network. Your accounts are actually on the ledger, not the client. What's really important, like in Bitcoin, is your secret (private) key: sXXXX.... - Make a hard copy, keep it safe, and you'll always be able to use any Ripple wallet client to access your XRP and IOUs on the network."

2016-06-15 18:18:58;why is the price so low right now?;" The initial reaction to the XRP news that New York approved Ripple's application for a Bitcoin license the other night caused an extreme spike in prices temporarily on Poloniex is a sign of things to come and is most certainly not a ""One shot deal"" The initial Spike will seem like a blip on the radar in retrospect 6 months from now when traders realize they could have bought in at 2000 Satoshi let alone 1000. That is why my prediction for XRP is, the market should resumes its all time high price at 10 000 Satoshi sometime in the next 6 months or sooner. Traders will be able to dream about getting XRP for a 1000 satoshis in that situation, however at that point the real world will have its hooks into XRP and no one will ever get it for this price again assuming that everything we are hearing from CoinMarketCap on the XRP social thread is accurate about all the work XRP has done to secure banking solutions saving the industry billions.

 It is easy to see now what coins are available at this range and to realize how quickly those XRP can be bought out when the market decides to start and climb up to the next level. When a given market shifts into a buy trend all kinds of really interesting things start to happen. Like all kinds of new Bitcoin start to appear on the buy books and massive sell walls mysteriously vanish. I don't think everybody should buy XRP because one fanatic like myself says it's a good idea however when you review what this crypto has accomplished and the work that the Core Developers have put in XRP over the last four years, XRP has countless interesting developments compared to things that are just being put out today in the form of Ico's that may or may not mushroom into something substantial.

XRP is at dream prices thats the reality. The original vision of Ripple was to create a global realtime money market for payment and forex that would use XRP as a common counter currency for all forex pairs, hereby concentrating liquidity on XRP pairs and allowing automatic bridging of fiat currencies via XRP. Initially the market was supposed to cater to everyone from individuals to financial institutions. But somewhere along the way they operated a change of strategy and decided to give up the consummer market and focus on financial institutions. Unfortunately they didn't really analyze well requirements on their target segment and failed to realize that financial institutions are tied by stringent and extremely punitive compliance requirements and would chicken out of using a crypto-currency for settlement or publishing their trades on a public network.

In other words Ripple is a great solution very ahead of its time but deployed on the wrong market segment. Although it had a bad start in the crypto community it could have worked as a global forex and payment network for consummers. But it pivoted and became an interesting exhibit of how current regulation prevents banks from evolvimg even when technical solutions are readily available.

The price of XRP reflects the hope that Ripple's leadership will reconsider their decision of giving up the (now thriving) consummer market or that (much more unlikely) the legal landscape can evolve fast enough to allow financial institutions to actually use Ripple, or that some institution will man up and dare trying in spite of the unclear legality. The bet is that if the situation evolves and enough financial institutions take a leap of faith XRP or Ripple diversifies and go after the consummer market too price could easily grow hundred folds. In the other hand odds are extremely uncertain and other protagonists are moving fast to propose solutions that would allow to shoehorn blockchain technology in existing regulatory framework.

XRP is an everything or nothing bet with an extremely high payout but an  extremely low probability, and a somewhat positive but low mathematical expectation that is expressed by the current price. If you like taking risks and can afford to lose 100% of your investment it can be a good horse to bet on. Not recommanded for the faint of heart.See comments in this other thread for a group of [reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/4lvrl4/santander_becomes_the_first_uk_bank_to_use_ripple/d3ypoov). 

Additionally, the number of XRP already in existence is 99 billion, so the supply is way higher than say Bitcoin for example, at 21 million. The difference is that bitcoins are being mined into existence, so are much more scarce. Taking into account all their developments and focus on serving international banks, you'll need to research the technicalities of Ripple and decide (how much or) whether you think it's worth investing in.Agree with the other comments. In terms of the absolute nominal price, one of two reasons XRP is relatively cheap is because of the vast supply. There are nearly 5000x more XRP than bitcoin. So for the same amount of demand one would expect the price of XRP to be 1/5000th that of bitcoin...[deleted]"

2016-06-23 01:09:48;pre mined coins;"Possibly. But they stand to make much much more money if XRP significantly appreciates. In that way, their interests are aligned with the individual investor's.That might be a profitable strategy if they did it months after creating XRP, but it is not the most profitable strategy given the sizable followup investment round of $30+million to continue developing the platform. A quick dump right now might net them $4-5 million in cash, but would actually turn out to be a loss. 

Their strategy is to enable new markets and capacity within the regulatory environment of banking, trade finance and digital commerce, as opposed to bitcoins' which is to enable regulatory arbitrage through civil disobedience and hope the disruptive force gains enough populist backing to supplant entrenched industry.


Consider this, XRP has been in existence for nearly 4 years, the only major dump was when the ostracized founder Jed McCaleb was trying to raise funds for his spinoff Stellar. Ripple took him to court for violating his settlement agreement and his XRP have been confined to a custodial account for regulated dispersal. 


As David Schwartz indicated above, Ripple's new incentive structure will be to subsidize market makers with its pool of XRP, a growth strategy not unlike tax waivers. Fearing a dump is justified given history of altcoins, but irrational given the context of Ripple growth into banking and trade finance industry. They will succeed in legal cross-border settlement and remittances where Bitcoin has failed, only managing to snag some capital flight and scrape some speculative foam.

FYI, Ripple Labs is now just Ripple.The concept of premining makes no sense in connection with a platform that has no mining. Are dollars premined?

Mining has several serious disadvantages. It's only sensible when you need it to secure the platform, as Bitcoin and Ethereum do. Those disadvantages are:

1) It channels the value created by the generation of new currencies into electricity consumption and ASIC manufacturing. Much of the value that Bitcoin has created has gone to these things rather than to building a Bitcoin ecosystem.

2) It forces you to trust whoever has the most money.

We don't need to give $400 million a year to three Chinese companies to let them choose which transactions go in a block. If that's what we want, we could just choose it. Ripple doesn't require proof of work to secure its transactions. Mining on such a platform would be equivalent to gifting XRP to whoever wastes the most electricity.

Instead, Ripple will use the value created by the ecosystem to make XRP usable as a vehicle currency. Specifically, we'll incentivize traders to keep spreads low.

We're not in this for a little short-term gain. That's not what our investors are after and, if you think about it, that would make no sense given the amount of money we're spending on things like regulatory compliance, ILP, and so on. You don't need 100 full time employees to pump and dump an altcoin.> From the Ripple wiki entry, the founders keep 20 billion XRP, while **OpenCoin** distributes a fraction of the remaining 80 billion for free to bootstrap the system (a task currently being carried out). Whatever OpenCoin does not distribute for free, it will then sell.

The founders received 20 billion of the 99B in the pre-mine for those that don't know. But also consider...

> To preserve XRPs function as an spam prevention, OpenCoin foundation must maintain the scarcity of XRPs by limiting their supply

Another consideration, if Ripple wants XRP to increase in value, thereby increase the value of their own holdings, as another user suggested, Ripple will hold onto their XRP (wouldn't you?!) //edited for clarity//. I'll venture to say they'd hold until its value makes them at least a trillion dollar company (and possibly keep holding!) because that is not beyond the realm of possibility when you consider the size of VISA. These numbers lead me to a projected $50 USD / XRP price point ($1T / $20B). But would they dump their holdings? It's not that simple, Jed McCaleb also holds some and is under sell rules that he needs to abide by. I'd say the status of 80 billion XRP in OpenCoin's hands is the obvious concern to all investors, but they've been completely tight lipped on the issue.

> OpenCoin representatives give us vague answers

Let's not forget, Ripple Labs recently got BitLicensed [NY](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-receives-new-yorks-first-bitlicense-institutional-use-case-digital-assets/), so any market manipulation will now be regulated and therefore darn near impossible. Again, it's OpenCoin that's the big concern, but in my mind that's a big question mark. The governing body for NY BitLicenses needs to take OpenCoin into consideration when regulating Ripple because once the value of XRP hits a certain level, (*warning speculation ahead*) say the arbitrary $50 USD / XRP, OpenCoin starts liquidating their 80 billion holdings, well this artery would have to be clipped real quick.

[Source of quotes](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=146964.0)I'm a Ripple noob, but there's a really important thing to remember here when it comes to the way a private company operates:

Ripple is a private company working in the United States and has been funded by VC money. The people who funded this company are not stupid, I'm sure there were contracts written up that basically require Ripple to act in the best interests of growing the business in order to more or less guarantee some sort of ROI to the VC investors. By dumping their coins before they can gain significant value, I'm almost positive that Ripple would be opening themselves up to an absolute shit storm of litigation from their investors for essentially defrauding them.

Much in the same way the CEO of a public company can be sued by the shareholders for taking actions that devalue their shares, many VC investors require the private companies to agree to mutually beneficial terms.

If they're ever going to dump their stash of pre-mined coins then they should at least wait until XRP has a market cap big enough to offer a big ROI to their investors on the dump and pay themselves a lot at the same time. But at that point they might as well continue operating normally because they'll be making a ton of money as a company by then.

Again I've only recently learned about Ripple, but I thought I'd offer my two cents because we have to remember that there is a legal entity behind XRP with an office in San Francisco, not just a group of devs working out of a garage in Europe."

2016-07-18 18:33:02;So much good news but...;"There may still be continuous sell pressure from Jed McCaleb, who has an agreement with Ripple to gradually sell some of his XRP to fund Stellar. This won't last forever. 

Banks still aren't sending large payment volumes, and so haven't driven a lot of organic buying. The early adopter institutions may also be getting grants of XRP as part of their adoption agreements with Ripple, so they won't need to buy for a while, but they will have a vested interest in XRP's value. 

Financial institutions take a long time to adopt new systems. Holding XRP is a long term bet, meaning several more years yet before seeing where it might go.A higher price for XRP benefits Ripple in several ways: It generates more revenue from sales of XRP. It rewards and incentivizes the entire Ripple ecosystem. It furthers Ripple's fiduciary duty to its shareholders to be good stewards of the company's assets. It makes innovations such as multisign and amendments more significant. It strengthens the case for XRP as the world's bridge currency, Ripple's long-term vision for XRP.

Quoted JoelKatz 19 July 5:23 AM XRPchat.comPatience, no need to freak out because other alts are pumping.I'd like to buy Ripple stocks. The company behind will be big. The currency on the other hand.... maybe, maybe not. It's use as I understand it is only for the big financial institutes and not so much for the average person. That might make Ripple itself a pretty bad investment tool.I should add that you can't say this is speculative currency anymore your company has proven success so the xrp value should be reflective of that success.Because nobody cares and uses Ripple? 
There is a big list of financial instutions testing, but nothing real in the pipe.

2016-07-27 03:54:17;What the XRP? Demand is good for banks and people.;"As the largest holder of XRP Ripple has an inherent interest in XRP appreciating. What they don't want is a big spike followed by a massive correction. They're also trying to do something hard, something no crypto has done to date (no, not even bitcoin) and that's identify a real world use case and but their token to work. 

They're doing that by addressing real world problems where distributed ledger tech can address what mainframes can't. 

That said, they don't need XRP to succeed in order to generate revenue, but given that XRP is simply a bit of code and there's no mathematical limit on how much it can appreciate, XRP appreciation is likely the most lucrative of all possible revenue streams. 

SteveCanada touched upon one possible reason why XRP would appreciate and this is the reason I'm invested in it (although not very heavily invested). It's that if Ripple is successful in deploying an FX marketplace then XRP as a the counterpartyless asset becomes an extremely safe store of value because it's sheltered from local fluctuations in fiat. This really needs a better introduction. What the hell are you talking about, or, more succinctly, what is it that WE are supposed to think you're talking about??

2016-07-26 03:42:38;RIPPLE (GATEHUB) FEEDBACK FROM CEO TO CEO;"Good post. The process is notoriously complex for the uninitiated. My original path was Circle.com -> BitStamp -> Ripple Trade, then migrated. I still had to get someone donate 50XRP to my account. 

GateHub announced that it had begun crediting user's accounts with 50XRP upon account creation but it looks like that never went into production...

It's a slick looking site but the REALLY need to work on usability. If there were a simple deposit method and simple trading controls they'd gain a lot of traction. They honestly need to get a designer that knows NOTHING about cryptocurrency to redesign the UX.I must say I spent many hours reading through forums before doing the wire transfer and exchange routine into what was then the live and working Ripple Client, turned Ripple Trade Client, then they were shut down. I ran into a couple of glitches but that was more on the international banking end.

You probably know gatehub and ripple are separate. Although, when Ripple decided to shut down their wallet client, after getting over a hundred thousand wallet users to verify their ID I might ad, ripple promoted gatehub. There in lies the problem. 

If crypto currencies are to go mainstream, the entire protocol, wallet, AND exchange stack must be integrated. Otherwise, it's just a farce of an experience for even savvy, well researched users.Hi Stephen,

&nbsp;

my name is Enej and I am the founder and CEO of GateHub. Thank you for writing this constructive feedback. Let me try and explain all the confusion and our future goals to make UI/UX better.

&nbsp;

**1) XRP Funding**

We started funding of Ripple Wallets about a month ago. Since then we successfully funded over 3500 wallets. The reason why the XRP's weren't deposited to your wallet is because our funding service was temporarily disabled at the time of your registration. We had to temporarily disable the service because some people started exploiting it (by creating multiple accounts). We solved the problem yesterday so it's now harder to create multiple accounts.

&nbsp;

Most of the problems would have been resolved if you were to receive initial 50 XRP.

&nbsp;

**2) Funding**

At the time we started developing our platform it was very hard to start using ripple. You needed at least two accounts (Ripple Trade and gateway) and you also needed to find someone to send you the initial 50 XRP. Not to mention the complexity of setting trustlines, etc...

&nbsp;

Our idea was (and still is) that there should only be one client capable of using multiple gateways. While the idea sounds easy it can be quite hard to implement, especially since most of the existing gateways lacked of modern API's. That's why we started basically from scratch. We developed both Gateway service that enables financial institutions to easily become a ripple gateway and a Wallet that let's end users to use it.

&nbsp;

When you first start using our (new) Wallet you are prompted to connect a gateway. Until you have at least one connected gateway it's impossible to Deposit & Withdraw money using any funding method. When you connect a gateway on GateHub, trustlines are set automatically which removes a lot of complexity. There is still a lot of work to be made on improving the flows but it's getting better every day (thanks to the people like you that gives us feedback).

&nbsp;

Having said that, if the XRP's are not funded before connecting a gateway, none of the trustlines can be set automatically.

&nbsp;

**3) Legacy gateways**

While we do our best to stay open in a way people that can trade IOU's of other (non GateHub gateways) on ripple network and use all functionalities Ripple Trade had to offer it is very tricky to at the same time provide easy to use, safe ecosystem where people can trust those gateways. Our problem is: we want to stay open, but at the same time we have absolutely no insight in the operations of those gateways. It's easy for us to require audits of gateways on our platform but we simply don't have that ""power"" elsewhere. That's the reason why some functionalities are harder to access (such as setting trust for other gateways or adding market pairs).

&nbsp;

To address you problems: you can enable Bitstamp trustlines for both USD and BTC (as you learned) but you have to do it manually. We contacted Bitstamp to address this issue and I am sure we can make it easier soon.

&nbsp;

**4) Future development**

One of the most requested features is that we add BTC gateway which would enable you to deposit BTC directly to your Ripple Wallet. I am happy to announce that BTC gateway will be coming to our platform in August. You can already experience how this will work with our ETH gateway.

&nbsp;

Our Wallet is being improved all the time. For example we added simple Exchange page for those people that don't have trading experience. We added direct deposits to and from Ripple Wallets about a month ago. We simplified the interface and we will continue to do so but the main problem exists that the concept of having a Wallet & Trading hybrid is simply too confusing for most people. We plan to solve the problem with our mobile apps. There are going to be 2 of them, one for sending & receiving money and one for trading.

&nbsp;

Together with Bitstamp we showed a demo of instant Interledger payment between GateHub and Bitstamp a couple of weeks ago. You might be interested to see how one will be able to send money from Bitstamp to GateHub in the future: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gZgAbuzmPk 

&nbsp;

We are currently focused on bringing as many gateways as possible to our platform. They will greatly improve the functionality and the state of ripple gateways ecosystem.

&nbsp;

**Stay tuned**

We know we can do better and we will do better. We always though of our Wallet as a ""playground"" to test how these new concepts might work together. Our goal was to inspire people like you to experience the potential of ripple network but it's still very early on.

&nbsp;

Creating a platform that connects legacy rails with decentralized technologies, enables you to instantly send / receive / convert assets while offering the ability to hold them in a preferred gateway and provide API access to them in a compliant and secure manner is a big challenge. One that we are definitely willing to accept given the enormous potential it brings!

&nbsp;

What you see is just the beginning.

&nbsp;

Kind regards, Enej

There's going to be a very large wave of speculators jumping on board in the next few months, so it's about time. I've been waiting for this for about three years.

I'll speculate that the announcement will be most of the 45 are internal testing. I'll be surprised if more than two or three have actual running, post-Beta implementations. Having said that, it's a massive leap for Ripple in terms of adoption. Once they start testing, it's only a matter of time until their protocol instances are live and serving customers."

It keeps blanking out (maybe his upload MB/s, or lack of RAM?), and he's got annoying notifications constantly going off in the background, *bah dong!*. Hopefully they see this and implement feedback for the next recording.
2016-08-12 13:37:41;seriously, how the heck do you buy any of it?;"Do you want to actually hold your XRP or do you want to simply have some on an exchange?

Any XRP that you hold on an exchange is actually an  XRP IOU. In fact, almost all tokens that you hold on exchanges are IOUs. You don't actually have them in your possession, the exchange has them in their own account/wallet. Exchanges can decide not to give you your crypto tokens for a variety of reasons (that is, not redeem your IOU upon request). 

XRP can be purchased with bitcoin on Kraken and Poloniex and with USD and other fiat currencies via [GateHub](www.gatehub.net). If you're looking for a simple fiat deposit method in order to buy bitcoin then register with [Coinbase or Circle](www.circle.com) and you will be able to buy bitcoin with your debit card. 

Then send bitcoin to an exchange that supports XRP and exchange your BTC for XRP. 

You can read more about difference between actually owning XRP and holding XRP IOUs from [**this post**](https://steemit.com/gatehub/@cmbartley/gatehub-brief-overview-of-ripple-vs-hosted-wallets) on Steemit.I used to use ShapeShift to convert my Bitcoins to XRP. Have switched to using Poloniex recently, and keeping my XRP in GateHub. Since RippleTrade is no longer supported by Ripple Labs, it seems there's only one reputable wallet client, as others have mentioned that's Gatehub (**edit1**: they do ask for a lot of personally identifying info so know that beforehand. And please add others if I've missed them).  I haven't used GateHub because I still have XRP in a RT wallet, which would in a way make it a cold wallet because there is no client to log into and send them out (ex: a thief-hacker). **e2**: I'm also assuming a better wallet provider will come along, which I can import my holdings into.

When you buy XRP, for example on Poloniex, make sure you aren't storing *all* your XRP in your exchange account. It's far more secure to store the bulk of your holdings in a wallet (preferably offline/not connected to the internet). This goes for all cryptocurrencies, assuming the wallet service provider is capable/trustworthy/reputable etc. 

*Vote note: Wallet Service Provider should be a thing - WSP!*"

In fact, because of this pivot, I'd be surprised if they were paying developers in XRP for bug bounties and third party apps.The incentive would be that you would be able to use whatever it is you developed.The ability to use the network for nearly free and some public servers and API endpoints.

There are bug bounties but you won't get paid anything just for contributing."

But I've recently thought that if I didn't use GateHub, I might not use anything at all. You can generate a new Ripple account at bithomp.com and just send all of the XRP you buy at Poloniex or wherever to your Ripple address, and then use bithomp.com to occasionally check your stash. You could try using the Minimalist Ripple Client (https://jatchili.github.io/minimalist-ripple-client/) to send Ripple to others. ... Of course, a good wallet would be nice too.
Ripply.eu has an .html account generator that works off line and can be used for cold wallet generation. Download it to a clean USB. Load it onto a clean computer that is not connected to the internet. Audit the code yourself if you are able to. Physically connect that computer to a printer, generate the account, and print it out. You can now send XRP to a new account that has never been on the internet.

Note, GateHub is probably the safest place to store you XRP if you want easy access to it. Create an account at Gatehub. Then create a Ripple wallet. They will automatically give you a ""hosted"" wallet but this is no different than holding your money on and exchange, technically the tokens are in their wallet. When you create a Ripple wallet on Gatehub it's your personal wallet and they hold an encrypted secret key.  Essentially this means you can close your Gatehub account and still use your Ripple wallet. It also means that if the Gatehub exchange is hacked, your wallet hasn't necessarily been hacked.

Go to XRPchat.com for more information.For reference:

Paper wallets & Address collision 

yeah, a paper wallet is a pretty secure way to hold your coins. Sure, they can be lost/stolen or destroyed (but so can a computer) - but they are completely offline and if made following the proper procedure, they can't be hacked.


Address collision 

There is always a chance of an address collision where someone else generates the same address as yours (and consequently be able to spend your coins), but the probability is so small that it's not a concern.

When you send your coins to them, they get recorded on the blockchain and 'become yours' since you are the only one who have access to it by the virtue of knowing the secret key.

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2ghptm/first_time_doing_a_paper_wallet_and_have_a/



Collisions (lack thereof)

Since Bitcoin addresses are basically random numbers, it is possible, although extremely unlikely, for two people to independently generate the same address. This is called a collision. If this happens, then both the original owner of the address and the colliding owner could spend money sent to that address. It would not be possible for the colliding person to spend the original owner's entire wallet (or vice versa). If you were to intentionally try to make a collision, it would currently take 2^107 times longer to generate a colliding Bitcoin address than to generate a block. As long as the signing and hashing algorithms remain cryptographically strong, it will likely always be more profitable to collect generations and transaction fees than to try to create collisions.

2016-09-16 17:58:14;Question: What is the point of investing in ripple?;"The goal of the company is to make the transfer of money across borders, across currencies, and possibly one day across other asset classes, as quick and cheap as possible. The role of XRP is to act as a bridge to provide liquidity. To do that it will not only have to have value, but that value will have to be stable and reliable. The best way to do that is to create and promote a market. People who buy XRP recognize that the market is new but believe that the goals of the company will add value to the financial system.Ripple is one of the very few projects (and the most advanced to date) that endeavor to create a bridge between the current private closed centralized legacy financial system and the new public open distributed crypto finance. Some people envision a scenario where crypto will take over fast enough to make the legacy banking system irrelevant without any need of a transition. Some people envision a scenario where the incumbents of the legacy system will up their game, accept to open up somewhat, and eventually manage to stay relevant for at least a couple more decades which will lead to a hybrid financial system part centralized and part decentralized. 

If you are among the former, crypto maximalists, there is no need to ""bridge"" the old system with the new one, and things can keep working with the current makeshift fiat on-ramps until everyone uses exclusively crypto: in that case investing in XRP is at most a hedge in case your vision doesn't materialize.

However, if you are among the latter you know that liquidity is still all in the old system and that a high-quality, sound and durable bridge system is needed to allow liquidity to flow between the old and the new system, and if you look around the options aren't many: there is R3CEV's Corda and Ripple's ILP+RCL. You can't invest in Corda (unless you are a very very high net worth individual who can chip in as much funding as their current bank investors). But you can invest in Ripple's RCL product. So the point of buying XRP is getting some indirect exposure to the success of Ripple as a new generation open-ended settlement technology provider.

To be clear it's a huge bet. Many things could go wrong. Chances that the RCL will indeed end up being a popular trading venue among financial institutions and large corporates are very uncertain. But the upside if that vision materializes is nothing short of mind blowing and could IMO be compared to the upside early Google and Apple investors have enjoyed.

So to make a long story short, investing in XRP is taking a bet that has relatively low chances of success but ridiculously high payout if successful. Only invest what you can afford to lose.15 of the top 50 banks on board....and counting.  the recent injection of cash ($55MM) ensures Ripple has a multiyear runway to make it work.

In Canada, 2 of the 5 big banks are already on board.  As is UAE's biggest bank.  

While success is not guaranteed, ripple tokens (coins isn't the right term imo), should increase in value as banking instituations begin to accumulate.

Major backers include Google, Accenture and Anderseen.  Smart groups with proven track records. 

In conclusion, you're investing in a crypto that has real world function, beyond just pure speculation.

Each person should do their own research and only invest what you can afford to lose.

Sorry if i'm not making sense. Kraken and poliex do not operate in NY anymore though because of the bit liscensing thats required now.I am from NYC too. You said you have bitstamp account. If you have bitcoin in bistamp, you can send your bitcoin to your ripple account in gatehub. After that you can exchange for XRP. https://www.bittrex.com/I'd recommend poloniex - best interface imoYOu can also buy using poloniex.  YOu need to send a bticoin to poloniex, and then once you have bitcoin there, you can trade them for ripple using the exchange link.  Its actusally quite nice once you know ho to do it.  Its likes playing the stock market, but every trade happens immediately, so you can trade between currencies all day long, using the same bitcoin that you sent earlier that day.

2016-10-21 05:04:05;Today, we are announcing that twelve banks belonging to a consortium led by financial innovation company R3 is trialing Ripple’s native digital asset, XRP, to scale liquidity and reduce the costs and inefficiencies of cross-border payments.;"Illiquid shitcoins move a lot harder because it takes a lot less funds to move them. Their order books are a lot more shallow than XRP.I can't say this for sure, but it's possible Jed McCaleb is still slowly selling off his XRP following the schedule he agreed to with Ripple after his departure two and a half years ago.  That would tend to keep the market from rising as much as it would otherwise, but eventually he will run out and the price will go up.Since the first of this good news began about a month ago, XRP has gone up in value around 50%.Ripple has positioned itself for banks and regulators (while they developed their tech) for a few years now and their communication has been crafted accordingly, imo. But with the recent announcements, and the strong possibility of xrp institutional demand, the price may be adjusted soon. Nice question, i think that it will rise soon but this situation is very strange!The available supply is way to big compared to the demand. Give it a couple of years, xrp isn't even a mvp yet. You can't give a product a value because of something it will do when it's finished. If it doesn't work it's completely worthless.

Can't say that the team is doing a good job marketing XRP either. Ripple-team is not making much noise in the crypto-space.

2016-10-27 15:31:08;Any speculation on the sudden price drop?;"[deleted]Btc surge,simple as thatI think Ripple (the company who created, and holds a percentage of XRP) is keeping the available supply in-line with demand, which keeps the price of XRP in check).  For example, when XRP demand goes up, instead of allowing the value of XRP to sky rocket, Ripple increases the available supply of XRP, thereby keeping prices in-check.  I think Ripple needs to do this for now, to show banks that XRP is a stable currency.  If you look at the long term charts for XRP, you really dont see the wild swings that you will see from other cryptocoins (Monero, Bitcoin, Ether, ETC, etc.).  
This is a good thing, especially when you are a young company trying to sign on the biggest, most profitable banks in the world, to use a service that as of yet, is both untested, and unheard of.  Ripple has a chance to revolutionize the banking system, making transactions occur almost instantly (instead of current methods which takes days), and in doing so, saving banks 30% to 60% in fee's.  Its a no brainer in the end, and once word gets out, XRP is going to increase, and eventually, Ripple will allow it to do so, even if at a slow but gradual pace.    Why do you think it is the most promising coin? Just for the feedback.... because the crypto community seems to be resenting ripple as their developers are allegedly signing contracts with banks who are not very pro-decentralisation...[deleted]XRP is a long investment.

2016-11-03 21:20:46;Reddheads – Independent Crypto News;"**Vision**

Reddheads.com is an independent, user-centred media outlet publishing news and articles about cryptocurrency. The ethos: good-quality, accurate and unbiased information, presented in a clear way.

Sadly, much of today’s crypto-journalism is far from independent and user-centred. On the one hand you have the traditionally-corrupt paradigm of media owned by entities with a vested interest in providing biased information and content (in the case of cryptocurrency, fund managers and market-making entities); on the other the intrusive and obnoxious advertising-revenue model.

As is the case with such aggressive business models, the first thing to suffer is the content. Too often it is hard to find good content without first having to wade through masses of poorly-researched and badly-written space-filler and marketing hype.

With the advent of Bitcoin one of the many areas touted as ripe for disruption is the business of online publishing. The idea is that micropayments will be able to provide revenue for publishers and content creators, in the place of intrusive advertising. So why are so many crypto-news outlets following the outdated advertising model?

Reddheads.com is ad-free and always will be. Graphics and links for banner areas on the website are chosen by virtue of their informative value. The website will never enter into any third-party advertising contracts or generate pay-per-click advertising revenue.

Today users can tip articles with Reddcoin, and further micropayment channels will be considered to support the business. As the website develops opportunities for sponsorship may be forthcoming, but the user-experience will never be compromised: in this case a dedicated sponsors page (which a user will only be able to access and view by specifically choosing to do so) could be envisaged.
The goal is to build a 21st-century online publisher that is totally focussed on quality content and user experience.

**Call for submissions**

To succeed Reddheads aims to engage with writers from anywhere in the world. As a cryptocurrency news website the media outlet welcomes submissions on any subject related to any particular cryptocurrency / blockchain project or more generally to all cryptocurrencies. Reddheads.com also welcomes submissions from members of crypto projects who wish to get information about their projects to a wide audience. 

Anyone interested in submitting writing for publication is invited first to make contact using the form on the website (https://www.reddheads.com/en/contact/) or via PM in order to receive a list of requirements for submissions."

Corda seems to be a [very different type of system](https://gendal.me/2016/04/05/introducing-r3-corda-a-distributed-ledger-designed-for-financial-services/) than Ripple's consensus ledger.  Corda doesn't seem to do much on its own, but provides a platform for banks to coordinate various types of agreements in a shared database.  Building Ripple-style cross-currency payments on top of Corda might not be impossible, but it would probably be extremely awkward, since it is not designed for that.  Ultimately banks might use both Ripple and Corda for different things, and they could be integrated in various ways.

2016-12-30 10:10:43;About XRP (price and functions);"The amount of XRP destroyed by transactions is very small, and can also fluctuate as needed. So if XRP appreciates in value significantly, fees will likely adjust lower to compensate. Even at the current rate however, all XRP could be exhausted by fees hundreds or thousands of years in the future. Currently very roughly 1 million XRP are burned each year. There were 100 billion created initially - so even if we assume 99% XRP in active use it would take 1000 years to burn past 1%. Further, it's possible to create a protocol amendment that can be voted on by the network to fix a problem of this kind.

Regarding your second question - yes, that's the idea. :)Also, a great place to ask questions is [xrpchat.com](https://www.xrpchat.com), it's an independent ripple forum, and Ripple employees often participate and respond to questions there."

Furthermore, in this case would there not be a great incentive to keep the price stable (at a low FX rate) and not allow any price spikes?

Let's see how much consensus there still is and where their nodes start off again.> These participants can at any time choose which validators they use.

https://www.bitstamp.net/article/xrp-trading-now-available/

In my experience, y'all gotta look out for **getting the correct number of XRPs in market value** - fees be damned. Before Bitstamp came out with their ""marketplace exchange"", buying let's say 1,000 XRP in the account, I'd get charged a fee, but would notice that the translation was allowing them to also skim XRP. 

If at a ""normal"" exchange, I'd get say 1,000, Bitstamp would show an offer of 700 or 800. The first time I bought I only noticed after, but wised up and soon exchanged in my then RippleTrade wallet because that's what it was designed for.

They probably can not do these sketchy practices in a more open marketplace, but when you consider their ""offerings"" of the crypto sold inside your account was up to 30% skimmed, the tiny 0.5% fee looks irrelevant. "

Follow the link on that page to ""access it online"" (or ""download the code""). Then, if you're really paranoid, disconnect from the internet. Put your secret in the top of the client, and click ""Set Identity"".  The address that comes up should match your public ripple address. This is all done offline, you can then close the browser and go back online.

I wouldn't recommend using the client for other things unless you really know what you are doing, it's powerful, hard to use, and easy to mess up your account.  But, even though, it's probably the quickest, easiest and safest offline way to verify which (if any) public account is paired with a ripple secret.  It uses code from bower-ripple (aka ripple-lib on node-js) which is the official javascript library created by Ripple for use in browsers."

That's actually very good news. Almost all of a sudden, Ripple ""started to care"" about its native token and just within a single quarter they sold 800M XRPs to financial institutions and market makers. That's almost 1% of all available XRPs - quite an achievement!!! 

It seems that business is running pretty well for Ripple. Time to go LONG.Interesting news from ripple to start 2017"

If you hover over the bids/asks, a tooltip will come up showing which account(s) placed the offer.  If you find the same account placing large offers on both sides, it's likely a market-maker and these amounts can be normal and will go in both directions daily and generally roughly equalise.

In this case, the account making those trades is one of the largest market-makers operating.  It did $180k worth of XRP/USD on both sides in the last week.  That's roughly 28 million XRP.

The PR fallout would be a nightmare, existing investors would be screwed, and new investors scared off.  Further, whilst this was all going on, it would essentially hand a competitor a huge sum to kickstart their competitive (and at that time, identical) product.  What they should've done, and still should do, is buy all it off  him and send it to a black hole address, or better, destroy it via an amendment. That would create insane PR, instantly raise the price, making existing investors happy and getting more investors on board.Omg do u guys ever shut up about Jed. His XRP are locked up, it's a non-issue and has been for ages. Seriously, your obsession with his XRP is almost pathological. He cannot impact the market, Ripple spent millions to secure his XRP, and still u guys carry on like a pork chop.The short answer is because he could have crashed the price repeatedly and maintained constant uncertainty that would have held the price low. With the price low, XRP cannot work as an intermediary asset because every significant payment would move the price.wait- who is Jed and why does he want to dump his Ripple?

There's zero reason that a speculative currency (XRP is particularly bad because it has very little community value) can ever serve as a bridge currency. The bridge needs to be more stable than the currencies being traded. For that you need a synthetic stable coin comprised of ultra low volatility uncorrelated assets with a large amount of counterparties. Dominic Williams Phi and MKR Dai are attempts in this vein, but still years away. 

RCL is great and Ripple will do a solid billion IPO, but XRP will continue to be fools gold until it's finally deprecated."

They 'pitch' to and work along side 'clients' rather than looking for any mass adoption.

The space they are looking to fill by apply blockchain tech I think makes that a good approach.

I should note that the company does not care about the xrp price because that has little to do with its functionality. (Edit) The functionality is what they are looking to sell.

That said I do think xrp will be more valuable than it is today if they can pull it off but I can't ever imagine say $0.20 or $0.30 a coin.

I of course can be entirely wrong though!http://xrpchat.comIt makes little sense for it to exist on exchanges. Unless you're a bank, you're not getting a use from it, and you certainly aren't seeing any ROI by holding it."

Everyone should read Vitalik's post deepening and clarifying the meaning of 'decentralization' before so.;"Many people who think they understand crypto use these words as simple labels. One example is what you have mentioned, another example is ""blockchain"" itself. Too many guys take it as some kind of mantra, for brainless repeat and also as weapons, that's really annoying.I agree. The question to ask yourself is what properties you want the system to have. Then look at whether it has those properties or not.

For example, one reason to want something to be decentralized is so that no one company or government can decide to shut the whole thing off. If that's why you care whether or not something's decentralized, then instead look at whether it has that property or not.

2017-02-18 12:15:44;Running a local client on Linux;"You can generate a Ripple keypair using the Ripple-developed ""ripple-keypairs"" node library.  It has a few ways to generate keypairs, the simplest being the ""generateWallet"" function.

First, install the library and its dependencies:

    npm install ripple-keypairs

Then, use it to generate a wallet.

    const api = require('ripple-keypairs');
    const l = console.log;
    
    var wallet = api.generateWallet();
    
    l('Ripple account: ' + wallet.accountID);
    l('Ripple secret: ' + wallet.seed);

While the above should be pretty self-explanatory, these are important concepts, so for redundancy:

The ""account"" is the ""public key"" (analogous to a bitcoin address).  Use this to receive funds to this wallet.
The ""secret"" is the ""private key"" (just like a bitcoin private key).  Use this to authorise transactions made from the wallet (sending of funds, trading of assets, account configuration, etc).  

If the wallet holds funds, the secret - for all intents and purposes - IS the funds.  Whomever has this, has control of the account.  It is of course meant to kept secret, hence the name.

Generating a wallet in this fashion has no effect on the Ripple network, it just gives you an address you can send funds to.  Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL, aka the ""network"") doesn't know you've generated anything, the previous procedure is done completely offline.  This means you can use the above code on an air-gapped machine to create a ""cold"" wallet.  A wallet only becomes a permanent part of the RCL when ""activated"" by receiving XRP from some source.  There are various ways to do this, check the ""links"" section at [xrpchat.com](http://xrpchat.com) for some.  Another way is to use shapeshift to turn some BTC or ETH into XRP, and put your ripple account as the destination.  Or, if you know someone with some XRP, you can ask them to send you a small amount, say 50 and give them the ""account"" you've generated above.Also, there's the ""minimalist ripple client"" by jatchili on github.  This is a pretty well featured, but pretty nasty-to-use client.  There are various other clients in the xrpchat forum linked previously.  If it's in the links section of that site, it's probably trustworthy.good luck.

There are many other reasons to buy but it is also not clear that XRP is required to succeed in order for Ripple to succeed. The token may ultimately not appreciate and therefore do not invest more than can afford to entirely lose. Yes.  But you can never know.  You have to make your own decision.  But, if you're asking me if I would: Yes, I would.  :)

Best investment advice is don't invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose.  It means you can sleep at night no matter what the price does.Personally, I think this is one of the most promissing currencies on the marketi recall when bitcoin was 50 bucks and then i made a big mistake to invest in XRP ,thats it .......lesson learnedYes load up on this. This is going to be big down the road.I bought about 30K of XRP today., I am confident they would increase in value and soon I wanna actually buy half a million of them.  The last time that I had a feeling I should buy a currency which I believed would go up in value was when I bought the Ethereum and Monero last year when they were around $10ish and they gained in value and I sold them before the price dropped.  I believe XRP has a strong potential.  "

I think 2017 will be good for XRP but that 2018 will be it's big growth year.

Personally I think XRP is an excellent bet, I do own XRP (but I also own BTC, eth, and about 8 other tokens). It's important to know that although all tokens can act as digital stores of value they don't necessarily always directly compete. Ethereum will likely never be able to rival the security of BTC, the attack surface is too large. BTC is slow and unwieldy, has poor governance, and is starting to lose a lot of the features that made it so attractive in the first place (anonymity, individual control of BTC, flattened wealth distribution).

Ripple Pros:
-Fastest settlement time of any blockchain-like technology
-Can sustain 1000 fully settled transactions per second, more than any other published benchmarks for blockchain-like tech
-Effectively zero-latency transactions (similar to Dash and others) with the PayChan feature
-Near infinite scaling given Interledger compatibility
-Santander, Google and others are invested, I.e. have skin in the game
-They are the only company in this space that has a bank transacting on their public blockchain (NBAD, the largest bank in the UAE)
-They are bringing 47 more banks online in autumn out of Japan (UAEs largest trading partner)
-They actually have regulatory, legal, and business experts so it's not just a bunch of idealistic cryto kids with a limited understanding of how the world actually works
-They sell XRP directly to financial 
institutions so they have skin in the game to engage in actions to push the price up (can also be considered a big con)
-The company owns 63% of XRP so they incentivized to push the price up (can also be considered a big con)
-There are many other pros

Cons:
-cryptoenthusiasts really don't like Ripple which limits how much it can further appreciate based on growth in the crypto market.
--They think it is centralized, it is not
--They think that the Ripple Consensus Ledger is closed, it is open
--They feel that the fact that the coin was premined makes it a scam
-Ripple works closely with banks, if you're more interested in investing in and supporting technology in order to dismantle the current financial system the Ripple is definitely not your horse
-Ripple is very weak on anonymity (although are making efforts to change that, see PathShuffle)

See www.xrpchat.com, the community is very well informed and you learn a lot about other tech too without all of the FUD you can on many forums. XRP holders tend to be a little less hystericalI've stopped viewing them as investments and starting thinking about how I can apply this technology in the future. Everytime I purchase a coin, I get more excited about the instantaneous nature of the process and what it means for p2p tech. 

If crypto actually takes off, and I have a business idea on queue that employs the technology or a supporting industry - that's my form of investment. Currently loaded up on ethereum btw! https://twitter.com/daikokunet009/status/837176096592289792"

In my experience, intermediaries take about 3% on a regular bank transaction involving currency exchange.

That's it!! Keep it simple :)All XRP held on exchanges are IOUs. You can create a true ripple wallet in Gatehub or via resources at www.xrpchat.com. XRP in a true Ripple wallet are owned and controlled by you. Gateways serve as on and offramps for Fiat currency and other assets into the Ripple network. Gateways serve as counterparties for non-XRP assets, I.e. the can hold CAD, USD, AUD, EUR etc on your behalf and you trust them to redeem actual Fiat for these IOUs.You can try using localbitcoins to buy btc then transfer the btc to Kraken, then use the btc to buy Xrp.

ETH and Ripple are very different technologies with different applications. Comparing them in this way isn't very productive.> 20 Tx/s for a global payment network is just nowhere near enough.

2017-04-09 16:00:35;XRP and Ripple;Go to www.xrpchat.com for extensive information about this question. Currently there is a bank network using Ripple technology. That network is private. There is a public network called RCL where individuals, gateways, and exchanges trade XRP for other assets. XRP is a payment asset and is constructed to facilitate conversion of one asset into another. The ultimate goal is to create a hub and spoke model with XRP at the center which will allow simple conversion from, for example, DASH into the Brazilian dollar in just two hops. Ripple has also created ILP (Interledger Protocol) which connects the bank network to the public network (they have yet to be connected). ILP also can connect the Bitcoin blockchain to RCL. Ripple has delivered its banking solution to bank with ILP on Board. The goal is to ultimately grow volume and liquidity on RCL then turn on ILP to connect the two networks. For regulatory and privacy reasons banks require a separate network but can source liquidity from regulated exchanges like Bitstamp sitting on RCL.[deleted]
2017-04-16 22:33:36;Ripple in 2020... 1000 dolars?;"Not a chance $1000 in 3 years... maybe $5 if everything goes well in my opinion Predictions:
2017 : 
Q4 stable at 0.074 USD with 2 peaks at may to .07 USD and .11 in July and dump quickly back to arround 0.074
2018 : 
Q1,Q2,Q3 average at .34 USD
Q4 .60 USD
2019:
Q1 to .8 usd
later the same year it will go back to .7 usd



It took Bitcoin 3 years to get to 1000, and they had significantly higher name recognition and a vastly lower number of coins... I think if we get to $10 by 2020 we'd be lucky. $5 at best.I feel like there are some gods/prophets in this subreddit somehow. LOLlol a thousand he says.  That would make most of us hundred Millionaires. This whole thread made me laugh.. If ripple reached even $1.00 it's market cap would be in excess of 350 Billion dollars... That's close to 20x more than what BTC is currently trading... 

Realistically, the hedge funds will get involved (or have gotten involved) and make sure the price is manageable.. I foresee that Ripple grows about 4-5x in the next 12-24 months.. This means that, in VOLUME terms, it would be trading between $4.8 Billion and $6.0 Billion making the value of the coins in circulation today worth $0.135 - $0.1715Anyone predicting over $1.00 needs to reevaluate their understanding of supply and demand.  You guys are ridiculous😂I will leave THIS here,

"" Markets are clearly connecting the dots that banks which join the Ripple network today are prospective users of XRP liquidity in the future.

some of the biggest corporations in the world are on corp welfare now and have been scams from the beginning... 

so sure call ripple a scam all you want but make sure you have a comparison to put it up to cause it STILL seems like a better investment than much of the stockmarket specifically because of corporate welfare degrading the ability of the corporations and keeping them on life support when they really shouldnt even have been valid to begin withI'd like to see concrete criticism rather than ""tons of"" it, because that's rather diffuse... Bitcoin also has tons of criticism for example.I don't even view XRP as coins for some reason.  I see it as something else.It's better for us. Lowers the amount of coin in circulation.  Less supply higher demand. 
Who owns the coins that will be locked down? Does that mean that they have a golden hand which sways the price at their whim...."

https://www.gatehub.net/fees

They have BTC,ETH,ETC,REP Ripple-issued IOU on the Ripple Network.
https://gatehub.net/gateways/fifth/
Bank deposits take ages. I bought bitcoins and then used www.shapeshift.io to change it to XRP.Gatehub is easy and userfriendly.Bitstamp's interface is easier to use, but has no ETH.  With Bitstamp you can buy XRP with EUR, USD or BTC directly.
Kraken's interface is complicated, but they are faster with withdrawals and deposits and have many cryptos. However, you can only buy XRP with BTC directly on Kraken (at the moment).
Use SEPA with either, usually pretty fast but sometimes Bitstamp has delays.Any suggestions for those living in the UK using GBP?Changelly is great."

BTC  was the Mini XRP will be  the Lamborghini.In 2020? One Ripple will be $2. If I am dramatically underestimating the price then I am glad. WHICH WALLET IS GOOD FOR XRP
what price did you by in for?My opinion, in the early stages, people cash in as price rises. Then they buy back as the price increases and hence they will resist selling at prices below their entry. As this will be behaviours and the volumes are large, it will take many iterations for it to reach a $1. To spur the price rise and the following behaviours of sell and buy back, requires consistent (or big) announcements or adoptions, this circular behaviours will require at least 3 years to get to $0.50, and then it will accelerate after that.[deleted]"

2017-04-23 13:44:21;Ripple burn rate;A small amount of XRP is destroyed with every transaction as a way of preventing spam.  This amount increases when there are a lot of transactions on the network to make spam attacks expensive.  There is a plan to make sure XRP never runs out and I think it's that the amount burned decreases as there are fewer XRPs available.  And yes, instead of those fees going to miners, they are effectivity paid to all owners of XRP by reducing the supply.Burn rate would be logarithmic most likely, so it could be 1,000 years, 100 years, 10 years. Who knows?Why do these XRP have to be burnt? Imagine the moral high ground that could be gained particularly from a sector that in the past have not necessarily be known for generousity if these XPR could be used to do good which would resignate with the more socially aware online sentiment.[deleted]

2017-05-07 22:44:19;How Ripple is Targeting an Entirely Different Market to Bitcoin;"TLDR: ""An intermediary such as BBVA utilizing the Ripple network for a customer can be understood as an intermediary using another intermediary to process transactions. Thus, in the long run, one of the two intermediaries could be rendered ineffective. Either users will solely rely on the Ripple network and utilize XRP to make transactions with each other or banks will develop their own blockchain network similar to SWIFT and simply discard its partnership with Ripple. The issue with banks developing their independent blockchain networks is the necessity of cooperation and collaboration. Hence, by relying on an existing blockchain network structured to serve financial institutions, banks can cut development costs. Three advantages Ripple offers to its banks is speed, certainty and cost. By utilizing a decentralized blockchain in Ripple, banks can potentially see a reduction of billions of dollars in operating costs. Whether banks will remain with Ripple and work on the development of a cross-bank network or form their own blockchain network like JP Morgan is still difficult to speculate."" - cryptocoinsnews


This a very risky but profitable investment please use your senses though don't just look at the stock charts, the company future is much more important. Be wiser than the guys who just sit looking at the charts investing off the hype and emotion.

Also JP Morgan along with Microsoft and many other big companies are working on a block chain network “The hope among Quorum’s developers is that blockchain can solve some of banks’ most intractable problems by replacing a web of connected databases with a single, shared, immutable record of transactions. The problems targeted include long and expensive settlement times, system breakdowns and lack of clarity about risk exposure.”

Quorum will compete with Ripple down the road, they can be using and testing the Ripple technology now seeming like they're supporting it but they want to surpass it.

I myself am invested in Ripple so in no way do I want you guys to feel I'm trying to be a hater, just sharing what I have found. The more we share knowledge with each other the better off we will all be."

They will use the ripple network and the ripple protocol.

XRP will get its value from being part of the corporation that provides that service.  Much like a standard exchange.Banks will use XRP indirectly as part of their payment chains. The originating bank will credit fiat to an XRP trader who sends XRP to another trader who has a balance at the receiving bank. The second trader's account is debited and the money transferred to the recipient's account. The transaction is coordinated by the Interledger protocol.  Neither bank needs to handle XRP, but this use of XRP will encourage traders to hold XRP in order to profit from these transactions."
2017-05-14 20:55:29;Noob question about withdrawing down the road;"Gatehub allows you to trade XRP for US$ and store it in your account.  So you won't lose value of your US$ while transferring to other bank accounts (in not sure what limit they set of transfers, if any).You can exchange your xrp to bitcoin on Kraken, and immediately to usd or other fiat.
Then send up to $25k at a time directly to your bank account. 
I believe it's  $25k/day and fairly sure there's a way to do higher amounts too.
don't keep large amounts of any coin on an exchange. if you don't have the private keys to your coins then they're not your coins; they're basically an IOU and are worthless if the exchnage goes bust, gets hacked, etc

set up your own wallet and keep them there. also means exchange limits are not an issue. >IF our dreams/fantasies come true, how exactly do you move your millions of dollars of USD from XRP sale to your bank account?

This type of thinking is literally cancer.

You think you can become wealthy without doing any of the work?Some of us are already living the fantasy.  I recently converted XRP to USD, via Bitcoin ShapeShift thru cointopal.com and a few other thousand dollars I sold on GAtehub and now waiting on Gatehub international wire.

2017-05-21 20:00:08;What's happening to XRP?;"Whales moving the price down for a better entry. Polo traders only looking for very short term gains moving on to a new fad. Regular profit taking. 

It could be any or all of these things. A 30% loss in three days is meaningless if you're in for the long term. Especially so in crypto, where 100% gains or losses routinely happen in a single day.

If you're in for the short term, then sell if you're uncomfortable. If you're long term, pay it no mind at all.Well first off, I'll simplify this:
1. Ripple has a very big list of employees who have many years of tech experience and are constantly trying to hire the best tech engineers. 
2. Their CEO Brad Garlinghouse, has been involved in many start up companies that have thrived. www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Garlinghouse
3. There are countless banks who have signed up to be a part of XRP.  There are many crypto trading platforms that are now using XRP.  Japan and Korea are now using XRP for buisness purposes.  www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)
4. They are constantly in the news talking about the future of payment transactions. www.ripple.com/press-center/
5. Ripple Hires Former Business Director at SWIFT gpi Marjan Delatinne. www.ripple.com/insights/ripple-hires-former-business-director-swift-gpi-marjan-delatinne/
6. They are still a penny stock but XRP market cap is catching up to Bitcoin. www.coinmarketcap.com/
7. They are constantly having world wide meetings that involve big global banks www.ripple.com/events/

Come on its a no brainer.  You have to HOLD your coins, these guys really know what they are doing.  They got so many investors involved that you loss track of them after a while.  It used to be that there was only one news article a week with XRP, now its at least 2-3 and some times more news articles a day about projects, sign ups and events.  And its still a penny stock?!  Why in the hell would they still be worth pennies and have a mega market cap like they have right now? Obviously they are building consumer confidence.  And in the world of cryptocurrency, you just dont know when their will be a pump and dump or a big whale that comes riding along flapping his fins.

My stand is with XRP.  When BTC made history and sky rocketed to new highs, that was the birth of all these ALT coins.  Every coin has its purpose and use.  XRP is for the banks.  Study and look into all these banks and companies that are heavily involved with Ripple.  Look at their stock chart price, you will tend to see that these banks stock values are $100 a share, $300 a share, $500 a share, $1000 a share.  They know what they are doing, they are building world wide trust with mega players.  And when the time is right, you wont see XRP as a little penny coin worth $.30 with a market cap of $13 billion.  What other coin is like this?  

BTC $2100, market cap $35 billion
ETH $165, market cap $15 billion
XRP $.33, market cap.... $12 billion....? (SUPPRESSION!)All seems very normal to me. I'm not worried at all. Of course there are traders. After a very fast increase in value some folks want to cash and some get nervous. Nothing new, nothing to worry about for longer term.

I'd say: you can sleep on both ears ;-)Zoom out to 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year.  Suddenly doesn't look so bad.  Stop watching the pennies move 1 or 2 places every couple hours and pay attention to the overall trend in XRP and the entire fintech market.Gettin slushed around by whalesRipple will be at Consensus, maybe there will be a small rally.

But I think more likely it'll be overshadowed by ethereum.Stop panicking :-)  Ripple will return with vengeance.  Its always going to be roller coaster ride, with big ups and bigger downs and then vice versa.  Long term, once XRP starts getting burnt up by the banks XRP will gain 'substantial' value.  My prediction, .60 in the next 60 days or so.Just ride the wave. rIdE ThE wAvE[deleted]Calm downXRP has been quite stable this past week, given the huge swings in the markets these days.  For XRP to stay within it's current trading band, it tells us quite a bit.  Whales will come back to XRP very soon (I'm guessing early this week).  The fact that it has held above .30 is an excellent sign of whats to come!  Remember, XRP is the only currency with real use cases (Ethereum maybe, but questionable).  Pump and dump, pump and dump.

After every pump, comes a dump and for now, every pump in ripple is followed by a shorter dump. 

Thats why Ripple is 0.30 and not 0,03 again.

Calm down its imposible to have rallys every day.I shared this link yesterday, hopes it helps a bit. https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/6cdpwu/this_likely_caused_the_sell_off_call_it_fud_but/?ref=share&ref_source=linkI think XRP is just finding the floor.  There is NO company, coin, or stock that can sustain the parabolic curve that XRP underwent.  Everyone needed to catch their breath, take ""stock"" of their finances, and the future.  

This is so normal...You need to really read up on Ripple and differentiate it from XRP. 

nb4: I own XRP. 

There's alot of chatter about XRP for alot of reasons. I'm not here to sway you either way so I'll point you in the general direction and allow you to come to your own conclusions. 

• Look up the rouge founder of Ripple and what new ventures he's into nowadays. 

• Look up what added banks and exchanges actually does for XRP.

• Research how Ripple and XRP are related, and what correlation one has on the other. 

• Understand how XRP is purposefully different from other cryptos and think how/why that would be useful to it's real world use objectives.

• Keep up to date on Asian markets, they affect this economy . 

• Keep up to date on tech rumors, news, releases. 

Like I said, I'm an investor just like you. I want a moon shot. Researching investments is always good, especially in an economy as fickle as crypto right now. Regardless of your ultimate feelings, expect peaks, expect dips, expect lazy days, expect euphoric days. Don't invest what you couldn't use for kindling and enjoy the ride! 

Ninja edit: full disclosure. I still have a net-positive position in XRP. As in I invested, made my money back and kept the 'leftovers' in for the Long haul.pumps over?Still holding, but I've been investing in some other currencies in the meantime. We shall see further development after tomorrow.The Chinese found ripple has 223 reasonably serious bugs in its code and deemed it an unsafe investment.  XRP should be collapsing but luckily there has been so much press regarding XRP being 'The next big thing' that normies are wading into the market throwing everything they've got into it.  All serious investors have btfo XRP and instead gone into less risky propositions.  Its all play money in XRP now, no whale will touch it.  Honestly, sell and buy NEM instead, don't believe me?  Just use Google and gtfo of XRP because it's set to crash n burn.  Lumens have a similar use case, and are cheaper.  Still a risky investment though."

1) Why can not we have a website with the 100 richest addresses like the rest of cryptocurrencies have?

2) When is Ripple going to announce the exact date of the month 0?nice post!Ok, I just bought 600 XRP. I'm in for the long haul.I've got 15k of the stuff, bought a few weeks back and the price has doubled since, give or take a few cents. It's shocking when you see the price change dramatically over a few cents, but in another month it'll be twice the price, much like any of the others will be. "

Either you store it on Gatehub.net (online wallet) else you order a Ledger Nano S and store it offline.I always suggest a hardware wallet, like others have mentioned here. If you don't want to spend the dough for extra security, I recommend Rippex desktop wallet.

Keeping it in an unregulated exchange (all of them) poses a risk if they pack up and dissolve overnight. Staying in control of your coins in the name of the game. I think these exchanges will actually disappear overtime and a better decentralized trading system will come along.Can I ask you where you purchased it from?

IF it turns out that Ripple is the blockchain of choice for Apple, then there could be some MASSIVE returns? No? Today dead cat bounce? Will the correction continue tomorrow?

2017-05-28 11:45:18;Bitcoin effect on Ripple;"I think Ripple platform, let's call it, has potential to make Ripple into something very stable with time.
Almost loke gold.

Also, I don't think we know all the potential bussiness possibilities that such a system
may bring along.

""Time will tell"", ofc, but for me it has a lot of potential.

If and once a solid news comes out, such as a major player, like Google for example, says they are investing or will be using it should skyrocket.

Ofc, a lot of if's, but that's the nature of this, no? :)The reason why you are seeing a huge correlation between bitcoin and other coins (like xrp) is because exchanges intertwine and interdepend these coins on BTC. Write to your exchange to ask for this decentralization from BTC to XRP. In the ideal world, we wouldn't be exchanging BTC for XRP and back. It would be a web of trading any alt coin or fiat for any alt coin or fiat.

This will come in time, but the only thing you can do at this point is contact the exchanges and ask them how they plan to solve this problem.This is something i'm a bit concerned about too. Like the fate of XRP is closely tied to Bitcoins succes. Maybe it'll be more independent in the future, as it'll be more established. But for now, it's amazing what effect Bitcoin has on everything. Perhaps someone with more insight could educate us, as to how it'll be in the future.Hi,
I hope that ripple executives will release something...starting from a new agreement, or something that will make xrp more solid...day are saying that is a stable token (they would) but from 0,37€ to back 0.10 yesterday is more like a roller coaster..by the way..it will only need time and that people stop to make just trading...but it seems hard to do...it needs to arrive to 1€ or 1$ then it will arrive at the 1st milestone (4me)

Iike it's completely impossible to hold even a steady, slow rise for more than a day. Feels like i haven't seen this kind of behaviour in any other crypto. What are the koreans up to? They overwhelmingly dominate the trading volume nowadays.The small amounts are definitely due to bots trying to either drive up or drive down the price. The sell walls though I have seen and it's usually to try to drive the price down so they can make a final purchase before letting them drop on the run up. It will get harder and harder for them to manipulate as the volume goes up though.I am invested in xrp for the long run. But I have been thinking the same thing recently not because of the small amounts of xrp being traded, but the fact that every run xrp does is being short lived. I am watching it closely on bittrex. Suddenly someone buys huge quantities of bitcoin in a couple of minutes (over 50 bitcoins but than it hits another wall after a short rally that wasn't there.  I feel the price is being manipulated by the owners that own huge amounts of xrp, I feel they are trying to cash out and make some profit at around this price. I still believe its going to jump eventually and I will HODL. It's an open market. Free for everyone to trade on.

'Price manipulation' is I guess not the right word for people buying and selling whatever they want.Interesting. If you go on polo, there are no more 5.0000 and 4.9875 buy/sells on ledger.

XRP is whats given them a 10billion dollars market cap and what has gotten them so much attention. If they can cause xrp to appreciate in value then they are pretty much writing a big fat check for themselves for the future. What business would turn an eye on the potential billions $ xrp would give. If I was ripple I would find as many uses as I could for XRP because of it.I don't think ripple is pivoting away from XRP but from what I understand if the xrp price collapses and nobody wants to use the xrp token they can still exist as a firm that works with banks helping them implement the ILP technology.  The banks don't have to use actual XRP tokens to take advantage of the ILP tech.

Now granted ripple wants them to use the XRP token because that will increase usage and perceived value, perceived security of the token thus making their 60 billion stockpile that much more valuable.  

However, it's seems like they've created a hedge/backup/exit plan.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  I am an XRP investor and I'm not trying to spread FUD.  I post so that people can correct me if my assumptions/understandings are wrong.Good post, i am still confident holding my 12k at .26I beliave XRP's main purpose is to become a bridging asset and enable even faster transaction vs standalone ILP system, mostly benefiting countries where fiat is much lower vs USD and EUR i.e India, Russia, etc. In my view the term asset is used by Ripple mainly for the banks to feel comfortable with the fact that XRP is not here to replace national fiats, however in the longer term it may as well become the world's currency, looks like next gen of USD.

The Luxembourg Stock Exchange has already introduced a blockchain-enabled security system, where the officially generated Signature by Appointed Mechanism (OAM), along with document type and document URL are stored in the blockchain ledger. For that the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) has added an extra layer of security into the certification process with the introduction of a ‘digital signature’ on all documents publicly disclosed by issuers using Ethereum’s blockchain technology. This new functionality that is already active and available with no supplementary fees, will enhance security for issuers and transparency of LuxSE’s certification service.

“Blockchain certification is an effective way to record the proof of existence of a document. Its continuous revalidation process makes it virtually impossible to spoof.”

“By introducing Ethereum’s blockchain technology into the certification process, LuxSE is providing a ""digital signature"" that will ensure authenticity and proof of existence of all documents filed in the OAM .”“By combining the security benefits of the blockchain with the electronic signature of the certification authority, LuxSE is able to create a highly secure and reliable decentralised infrastructure to store information relating to the “proof of existence” of such documents indefinitely.” Bernard Simon, Chief Information Officer at LuxSE

This gives me great pause about investing my monies in Ripple. 

Think about the early days of the Internet. It started out in government, extended to universities, then was embraced by the large information service providers, and then it was a mass market product used by everyone. We're following much the same pattern, targeting the existing payment processors and financial infrastructure with an open protocol that anyone can connect with and to.They won't dump on their investors as Ripple will be putting their XRP into 5yr escrows by the end of 2017. Also, Ripple is not a proponent of individuals trading XRP. This makes you think the XRP story hasn't even started yet. This makes you think they are just completing chapter 1.
Multiple banks in the 100's have since joined the consortium, and they are planning to deploy a commercial version of the blockchain solution at scale in October 2017.  From what I can see, theres no reason not to hold for the next 5 years. But I also recommend to watch the other big 5 and slowly spread the wealth accordingly. XRP saves banks double what they would have saved had they used Ripples service along with XRP, but XRP also allows for near instantaneous transaction times.

2017-07-16 21:29:23;XRP being used by FI's - how and what happens?;"No, they use a provider. The bank only owns ripple for 5-10sec. The bank dont care if the coin is worth 1$ 100$ or 1000$. The bank just wants to transfer x-amount of money from Bank A to Bank B.

So today m.cap is around 5b$. So if banks start to use XRP and they are transfering billions and billions of dollars the price need to go up! Thats the point.

In other words: no, bank will not own the coin. But they can if they want, and its probably cheeper for them because they dont need to pay a fee to rent the coins. So IF the bank wants to own the coins it will not be a disadvantage being late(because they buy x-amount. 1million today and 1million in two years is stil 1million), but if a bank join early and buy coins they will earn money on the price going up.[deleted]does banks even need to use XRP to use this technology?

2017-07-23 18:20:23;How do you justify Ripples market cap?;"First, stop thinking of XRP as Ripples market cap, it isn't. This is a fundamental error in establishing what fair value is for XRP. It's all in the use case. 

XRP circulating supply represents the volume of fiat that is available for money movers to transact from A to B within a settlement window. 

Today, if one bank needs to move 5 billion in a XRP transaction, then there is only 2B left for similar transactions until the settlement window is compete (say 3-5 sec). 

This assumes EVERY SINGLE XRP is available for representing fiat transactions, which they obviously are not. So the circulating supply is even smaller.  As high as you think it is in value, it's simply not sustainable at this price with increasing adoption. 

The more banks and institutions that use XRP, the more money is juggled in the air at any one time, the higher the price per XRP must be. It's all based on the use adoption of XRP. 

Ripple just owns a lot of it is all. 

Imagine XRP being new physical dollars that are crated up and sent in transactions between banks, settling back and forth. 

Is 7B enough for banks to do day to day business with? Not by a long shot. This is the justification case for XRPs potential value. "
2017-07-23 17:54:18;Ripple to expand Payment Provider Partnerships this Quarter (this means XRP to become like VISA);"Thanks for this info. Sometimes I think so many other coins (outside the top 4 or 5) are deliberately designed and funded to do a good job keeping investors away from XRP.   I have been thinking about this too since it was said.  I think it is interesting you mentioned visa.  I actually believe from statments mentioned earlier this week we will see a partnership with visa not just them being like visa.What hold xrp down?Recently, Paypal had a job opening specifically for people familiar with the Ripple payment protocol, and around that same time Visa unveiled a cheaper way to do remittance.

Things are happening fast.XRP is the future. Partnerships is a buzzword to generate awareness and keep the growth going. All it means is that they are going to explore the integration of blockchain/ripple into credit card transactions. With all the buzz around crypto companies would be fools to not partner. What develops out of all of this is a whole different thing.

It is a good thing for certain.

Personally I still can't find a reason to get heavy with investing. Not until I have enough assurance that the token holders will not get screwed. 

Does anyone know if there is anything preventing them from becoming a publicly traded company?Thanks, but I don't need an education in the philosophical underpinnings of investing. Just wondering if you were aware of some facts that I am not. Ripple will be one of 100's of local and alternative payment methods (which include bitcoin) that most card payment service providers or payment gateways offer. It may affect the price, but not to the extend that you think it will. Largely these payment methods go unused by merchants, only act as a support for sales conversion when presented with options. There may be a few bespoke merchants who use the technology extensively, but by and large merchants use cards for payments and it wont change any time soon. "

Gatehub started so good but now... they don't answer support tickets, servers doing strange stuff i.E. the 2fa authentication.

I even had to call my bank to reverse the SEPA transaction because they just did not credit the 300 Bucks and another 200...
After 2 Month of waiting I got my 300 back but the 200 are still stuck... After a month I got an answer to my ticket saying they will contact me when they  looked up the transaction.

At first I thought they had problems because of the user run on exchanges recent months but in fact this is so akward. Glad I got no IOU's of them, holding xrp tight in my wallet.Good i thought i was the only one. I was like WTF.....Yes I agree the gatehub website is buggy, but really, many of these online exchanges seem to be overwhelmed the last few months with new users etc. I think you should just calm down a bit, if possible. I find I can get good executions on Gatehub, there are good trades to be found, and basically trust them with my coin, even if the website janks out sometimes.Bitstamp is only serious exchange and fully licensed. So, just use logicStill having trouble? I'm still getting the ""User Still Loading"" messageNeed google chromeYes! Buggy as hell! 


Last night, I tried to submit a buy offer and it failed so I logged out. After a few hours, I was horrified that the bid was placed twice! It sold all the bitcoins at a bad price!


I really like gatehub to be real good,really want them to succeed. But with all the bugs and frequent downtime, they are just not ready yet. They're giving XRP some bad rep.

I'm more than happy to be a bull and let my XRP sit for years in hopes larger companies and financial institutions adopt the technology for their transactions. I think all of us see it the same way. 
It was less than a penny stock when it got a buff of 4000%. As a stock or crypto gains more value, smaller percents begin to matter. 
This stuff is in a phase where the volatility (no matter how profitable) doesn't matter. What matters is the companies behind it take the right steps to make it grow, and I feel confident that Ripple is doing exactly that. "

2017-08-06 20:44:48;What should price of Xrp rise to once SBI Group starts using for commercial use?;"SBI Sumishin is worth $29.3bn at present time. It would be the equivalent of raising the market cap by that much, I suppose, so basically 5 or 6 times the price it is at now. Conservatively speaking, the price should jump to a stable 1 dollar a token.

Could go higher due to mania, could be significantly lower, depending on how many tokens, if any SBI purchases.

Edit: to clarify, I'm not going to speculate on how high the price will initially go, but looking at current trends, we seem to be in a baseline phase right now. The price has been steady for some time, ready for the next big push. If they start ordering massive amounts of XRP tokens, very likely, they will have some sort of internal exchanges for this, setup directly with Ripple, The price could initially jump to 2+, but where it will settle is somewhere in the 1 dollar range. 

The real big advantage will be that their competitors will start to notice the market edge that SBI will have, transactions wise, and will start to adopt the ripple token as well. Then, hold on to your hat, because we are in for a real rollercoaster, there is no telling where the price might go then. If their partner, JP Morgan starts using it, I'm not even going to speculate how high it could possibly go.
 

Here's something important people aren't talking about; when banks adopt XRP, free up money tied up in nostro to drum up more business, reduce cross-border payment fees and make those transactions near instantaneous, their stock prices will shoot up. Some banks will experiment different ways to send payments but none will directly compete with XRP because only XRP on ILP can settle payments in seconds. Elimination of nostro and counterparty risk. No other digital asset does that and no other coin will have the liquidity, publicity, and a solid team of developers supporting it.

&nbsp;

Just imagine what will happen to the demand of XRP once SBI reports actual figures in Q1 2018 report; 60-90% reduction in fees associated with international payments. You would then wish you had bought more XRP when it was still under 0.20 USD.

&nbsp;

In fact, I think anyone who still has doubts about XRP (after learning all about it) is crazy. Actually crazy. If, on the other hand, you don't yet fully understand what XRP does for banks or don't even know what you don't know, then you got a lot of reading to do. What Ripple is trying to do with XRP and all the actions and steps they have been taking past few years is not something you can easily learn and understand in one day of reading.

&nbsp;

To answer the question, I wouldn't be surprised to see $1/XRP before 2018.http://www.sbigroup.co.jp/english/investors/disclosure/presentation/pdf/170727presentations.pdf

Scroll down to pages 72-91 for all the references to Ripple and Xrp. It's cut and dry, they are going live with Xrp by the end of the year. I guess all we can do now is buckle up for the ride.Because thats when people will stop with  ""bUt dO tHeY uSe xRp""?
And start some other made up shit to satisfy their saltiness lmaoIf more banks see that it works for SBI then we will finally see a snowball effect. How big that snowball becomes and how fast it grows, thats the real question. 

Banks save cost by using XRP so I dont think anyone would go without which is what Ripple intended with the systemDo you have a link for this? Interested to readThis is all great info. The Sbi implementation is a huge step for Xrp and will only grow from there, as other banks join on, once they see the speed and savings. I'm certain the price will jump, just not certain how much. One would think the price would jump every time a large institution signs on. Japan has he third largest economy on the planet so hopefully Sbi will be a great start and will go up from there.But what if the following happens: 

Ripple holds half the xrp supply and has said before that they want to sell the xrp to banks off its own books. What happens to the xrp price when they do that? Probably nothing at first, because the transaction is done in private.

The price will start to rise once ripple cant service the banks demand and they buy on the open market.


Alternate scenario: Banks demand is so big that ripple sells its holdings at huge premia and drives up price that way.

Disclosure: I own ripple. [removed]Where do they state this?It looks like slow steps but actually this steps are huge and global. Decreased costs and decreased time consumption in transactions is something what every bank wants. Some of them will start, other will follow.

Else 
{ echo ""let's keep hodling""; } endif;I'd cash half out at $10If it can hit $10 it means a lot of banks have already started using XRP on a day to day basis then $10 is just the beginning. I'd cash out at 1 lolDepends for me really. If  it went to $10 next year based purely on speculative bull run I'd cash out 1/3. If it was due to increasing adoption over say the next 2-3 years I'm not sure I'd cash out anything. It would probably go a lot higher. I might cash out a bit, but still. It really depends. I wouldn't ""cash out"" any big sum anyway as I'm basically building capital and reinvesting for at least 5 years, I might start having some fun at some point since ""YOLO"" etc, but I'm looking for financial freedom, not an overpriced fishing rod.Yeah, so my overall take on XRP is that due to the banking influence of the controlling company, they'll have a strong advantage entering and dominating this market initially.

Once tech catches up and offers faster and cheaper methods, banking tech will follow the trend of all banking tech and slip into playing catch-up, opening the door for other future cryptocurrencies.

The key is to catch Ripple at its peak, just before other crypto's enter the same market. The question posed is really ""What dollar amount would make you cash out?"" but I believe the true question is ""What are the market indicators that would lead you to believe it's the correct time to cash out?"".

If it's $10 a coin and there are no hints of newcomers on the scene, I hold.

If it's $10 a coin and something like IOTA is being considered as a replacement for existing XRP tech, then I cash out.I'd cash out enough so that I've made my investment back, everything else will be profit to hodlMost likely- depending on when, how fast, etc. I'd continue my logic; hold most of XRP, trade with small portion. 
Also depends how long it would take to reach 10$I would like to do this, but I likely would have already pulled 50% out at $5.Just bought some Ripple, I will cash my initial investment and i'll leave the rest. Unless it happened overnight, I'd have sold well before that! lol  No, I own a negligible amount compared to people here. It would need to hit $1k for me to be able to sell and retire.this is very optimistic price prediction ;d

2017-08-20 21:54:01;Analysis In Chains will do a show on Ripple this Friday! I'm doing some research.;"I don't have time right now to give a more full response, but I'd like to point out two things:

1) Ripple, the company, has a specific use case in mind for XRP. However, others are free to use it for any purpose they like. The ledger's design rules ensure that all technically valid transactions (properly signed and so on) that pay a sufficient fee (way under a penny) will get applied unless the network as a whole is broken.

2) The 20% fault tolerance is just for the network to make forward progress. That is, if more than 20% of the validators fail, the network cannot make forward progress. It has nothing to do with double spends or censorship resistance.

It's important to understand that mining/PoW only does two things for bitcoin: First, it performs the initial distribution of the native asset. That obviously doesn't apply to Ripple. Second, it ensures that people will agree on the order in which transactions occurred. That's really all you need to avoid double spends and that's all we need mining to do. Ripple, not having mining, uses a distributed agreement protocol to ensure that everyone agrees on the order in which transactions execute so, for example, we'll all agree which of two transactions that constitute a double spend will succeed.

Most of the important security properties of the ledger do not come from the validation system. All nodes check transaction signatures. All nodes execute transaction and produce their results. In principle, the only thing you can't do by yourself is ensure that everyone agrees which of two valid transactions to execute first. That is the only thing mining does that XRP needs and that is what the UNL and validation are for.Hi.  I recommend that you reach out to JoelKatz (AKA; David Schwartz, Ripples CHief Cryptographer) who is a very active member over at www.xrpchat.com.  You will find many highly knowledgeable people over there.  

I'll answer what questions I can:


Does anyone know about the development timeline that's been planned for launch?

Answer:  A better question for David Schwartz, but a couple banks have gone online already, with many more planning to launch this quarter and next.  SBI has already confirmed that they plan to use XRP - source:  https://ripple.com/insights/sbi-holdings-views-on-blockchain-and-xrp-an-interview-with-yoshitaka-kitao/


For investors, how much of your crypto portfolio is Ripple? 
Answer:  About 25% of my crypto portfolio is invested into XRP.

Do you think of Ripple as a focus, or more of a hedge?
Answer:  I think Ripple is the best investment opportunity of all the digital currency offerings.  Ripple employees close to 200 people, includingex-bankers, ex-Swift Employees and some of the best software engineers in the world.  Ripple has billions of dollars in assets available to them if needed, yet they offer to lock those assets up in smart contracts in order to provide confidence to investors.  Brad Garlinghouse recently stated that Ripple will be cash flow positive by the end of this year, so Ripple does not need to sell XRP to keep the business going.  But how many companies in the world have billions of dollars in assets to back them up if needed.  
  

Why did you choose Ripple? Was there anything in particular that made it stick out?
Answer:  I started with Ripple five years ago when Ripple was giving XRP out for free.  Back then, you signed up for the World Community Grid by giving them access to your computers CPU power while not in use.  The World Community Grid used the CPU to aid in the discovery of Science (cures, etc.).  In return, you received XRP.  Over a six month period, I received about 27k XRP, not bad considering at one point, that 27k XRP was worth close to $13k.  After a couple of years, I started to see Ripples plan build into something that could turn Ripple into a household name (think, Swift).  Ripple went from 0.006 to .42 cents within a month.  We are now back down to .16, but Ripple has has several bull and bear markets over the last few years, so I expect another bull run out of Ripple very soon (Miguel Vias recently did an interview with CNBC in which he stated that this quarter, Ripple will announce new partnerships and payment providers focused particularly on XRP.  



For the technical minded - Does anyone know how Nodes choose the list of unique non-collaborating nodes to poll from? Or is that still a state secret?  
Answer:  Sorry, can't help here, but David Schwartz can!


How tight-knit do you perceive the community compared to others in the Cryptoverse?
Answer:  Ripple investors are defensive due to the fact that we get tons of crypto purists leaving FUD comments that are always completely untrue.  It eventually becomes rather annoying to read on a daily bases.


From what I can tell, Ripple seems to be mostly a stand-alone project, not a platform to build off of. Is that accurate, or are there developers working on add-ons using Ripple?
Answer:  Ripple can be used for many things, including micro-payments (think payments worth a fraction of a cent combined with wireless smart devices).  Ripple recently added Xcurrent, Xrapid and Xvia.  See their web site here for details (click on the following link and scroll down a ways):  https://ripple.com/
>For the technical minded - Does anyone know how Nodes choose the list of unique non-collaborating nodes to poll from? Or is that still a state secret?


The Unique Node List is set by each person/company that runs a Ripple validator. The idea being that other validators can decide who they trust and don't trust to validate the network based on traditional trust indicators such as being a large publicly traded company or a well respected not for profit.


>From what I can tell, Ripple seems to be mostly a stand-alone project, not a platform to build off of. Is that accurate, or are there developers working on add-ons using Ripple?


There's no reason why more tech can't be built on and around Ripple. It does not feature a Turing complete contract language if that's what you mean. That said: the Ripple ledger is designed to inter-operate existing payment systems including other crypto-currencies. So it is definitely not a stand alone project.


>Is there any particular fact or interesting aspect of Ripple that you'd like me to read on the podcast?


Ripple is the only crypto-currency other than Stellar (which is a Ripple fork) that can scale long term in our opinion. It achieves this by recording only current account balances (unspent tx outputs) rather than all the transactions that have ever occurred on the network. So for each new account added to the Ripple ledger (each new user) the size of the Ripple ledger (""blockchain"") increases by a constant amount. Contrast this with Bitcoin and Ethereum where the size of the blockchain grows much faster than linearly. (In Bitcoin and Ethereum for each user added to the system all of the transactions they ever make are added to the base-state of the network.) In addition: the validation process in Ripple is co-operative rather than competitive which means transactions can be validated and confirmed very quickly, generally in seconds with no scaling penalty.


>Do you figure the 20% fault tolerance is sufficient for a network serving the banking industry?


Because Unique Node Lists are chosen by validators and because the validators that other validators trust are generally public, well known organizations, the chance of any trusted validator attempting to defraud the network is quite low. Evidence of the fraud would be easy to obtain since the ledger is public, and lawsuits would likely ensue. Compare this to the SWIFT network where the number of parties required to commit a fraud is one and it's pretty clear Ripple is a big step up.

/u/sjoelkatz might respond with more detailed answers.
Why did you choose Ripple? Was there anything in particular that made it stick out? Ripple solves real world problems with cross-border payments.  The year is 2017 and to pay someone in Europe from the US, it is faster for me to get on a plane with a bag of money than it is for me to send payment thru our current banking systems.  With ripple, the same payment takes just seconds."

Get in when it hits atleast .18 - .19. There's no reason to lock up your money in Ripple right now. Maybe put it into another coin showing gains, like bitcoin cash, etc

EDIT: also, sell it when you feel you made comfortable profits.It's because it hasn't mooned.

I myself have cashed out a while ago just because I want to use the money to earn a but trading forth and back but I'll be putting 1/4 of it back in ripple soon.Scepticism comes from a technical point of view. If you make a deep analysis it become clear that while Ripples ecosystem is good, XRP (the coin) is far from being  the key element of this ecosystem.
For now, you can't expect for a major growth until Ripple force Banks to use XRP as a main currency, not as a gateway. People are mostly sceptical because they think banks control Ripple. And because of that it is not a decentralized currency.

2017-09-03 22:53:58;Calculating profits;"I know several people who became millionaires just this way. But it's very important to understand that there is absolutely no guarantee that XRP will ever return to thirty cents or higher ever again.

I bought 40,000 ETH in the original crowdsale and managed to sell them at $1.05, tripling my money in a little over a year (and making a little extra on the ETC). I put some really nice solar panels on my roof and thought I was an investment genius. If I had sold at the all time high, I would have made $16 million.Your math is fine, but it would be closer to $10K. 

1000/.032 = 31250 XRP

31250 * .32 = $10000 -($2) commission.I put just $500 into XRP a few months before April, made well over $10k."

I'd be down to list some physical XRP coins on that marketplace once they get shipped! 😁 Only accepting one form of currency, that is new and mostly unknown to the public, can not be a good business model loldo it. It will be going with trail and error for sure. but these things get people millionaire in 5 years. Yes, could only be a positive thing! In my opinion, do it right and launch it before Black Friday and Christmas and you'll see some decent adoption.

2017-09-03 20:04:19;Is there an app like coinbase to buy ripple?;"Following! I just sent in my verification for Bitstamp but I'd like to just by real quick them move directly in to my Ledger. 

I recently started using Shapeshift.  If you have any other crypto (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, ect.) you can easily exchange it for Ripple via shapeshift.ioi just used changelly for the first time today...worked flawless.......i bought litecoin on coinbase and sent it through changelly to bitstamp for XRP......didn't have to ""sell"" my litecoin first.....What country are you in? Kraken has an appWhat about changelly to exchange from your current coins to ripple?  I didn't have an issueChangelly can be a little more expensive than other options. They charge you a network fee + 0.5% commission. Shapeshift does the same thing and only charges you a flat miner's fee of 0.5 XRP.
The other nice thing about Shapeshift is that you don't need to make an account. This means you don't have to hand over any personal info to a 3rd party.Gatehub.netKind of - yes, it's called Binance. This is how I do it and what I believe is the the quickest, and easiest way to buy Ripple and avoiding all hefty transaction fees.

* **[Create a Coinbase Account](https://www.coinbase.com/?r=5a1f3a57b2fd6000c8f8b58b)**    


Go through directed steps
Purchase desired amount of Bitcoin, or Ethereum (You’ll need one of these to exchange for Ripple).    

* **Transfer your purchased coins to GDAX**    

Under BTC, go to “Deposit” -> “Coinbase Account” and type in the amount of Bitcoins you’d like to transfer over (this will be the amount of BTC/ETH you’ll use to buy Ripple).    

* **[Make a Binance Account](https://www.binance.com/?ref=12590621)**    


Go through directed steps
Go to “Funds” -> “Deposits Withdrawals”
For BTC, click on “Deposit”
Copy the BTC deposit address    

* **Go back to GDAX**    


Under BTC, go to “Withdraw” -> “BTC Address”
Paste the address you had copied from Binance into the field
Type in the amount of BTC you would like to transfer to your Binance account    

* **Go back to Binance**  

Go to “Exchange” -> “Basic” or “Advanced” (just depends on your preference).
Click on “XRP/BTC” on the right-hand column
BUY YOUR XRP! (Remember, you’re trading BTC for XRP)
Type in the price of BTC you would like to purchase your XRP at. Binance makes it easy by giving you options (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of the amount you’d like to buy.

Enjoy!
coinbase has gdax which you can use to exchange

2017-09-10 19:18:42;Banks buy 1 billion Xrp;"Next time title your post ""What if banks buy 1 billion XRP""Although I'm a huge believer in Ripple and XRP, banks won't be buying it as a speculative investment to hold. At least not on a significant scale. They will move into and out of XRP for interbank intercurrency transfers from fiat back to another fiat.  Right now banks must hold multiple different currencies in their accounts to be able to process these transfers. XRP offers way out of that plus lower fees and rapid transaction speeds.

You are correct that the market cap will have to be much, much larger for XRP to be able to handle the transaction volumes currently processed every year.  I just don't see banks buying up millions of XRP to hold for long-term or to use later. Most banks fall under regulations that prevent owning highly speculative investments anyway. Imagine if a bank had sunk hundreds of millions into XRP at its peak a few months ago.  Regulators and/or shareholders would be calling for heads of management right now. who says banks need to buy xrp.  my understanding is Ripple is willing to give xrp away for strategic purposes.i hope you're right hahahaYou are looking at it the wrong way. Banks wouldnt be buying it for it to appreciate or depreciate in price. They would be using it as a catalyst to send their money across platforms around the world. They would also be receiving it in the same manner.  It isnt a speculative asset for them. 
Ripple themselves have stated the banks want a stable price. For that to happen, the price does have to increase tho. At $2 a penny difference is only .05%  At .20 a penny difference is 5%.  The banks definitely do not want to use an asset where their money can disappear by that much at a time.  Yes there are 3rd party intermediaries that will absorb the price difference, but still, that much of a difference would be a huge gamble for that intermediary.
The fact is, the price has to appreciate for XRP to be more viable.  Once it hits that range, the price will stabilize and have less and less movements.Not sure you understood how the markets work.

And please change your title as it is very misleading!Cheaper for a bank to make their own chain. That's what they all are doing. I've seen signing bonuses as high as 250k. They aren't messing around. Awakening has happened, and now comes the panic reaction. No reason for any bank to use a private chain like ripple when they can have their own private chain. It's a competitibe advantage, and it provides a massive ROI."
2017-09-10 18:10:58;Price analysis and trade opinions;"All of this conjecture matters not at this price. Either be in or out. 

Once banks adopt and put XRP to use, there is not a single day trading whale out there that will have any influence whatsoever on XRP price and volume. 

Whales become minnows, and picking buy/sell targets on charts driven by 24hr bank transaction settlements is a fantasy. 

What will happen, is that the XRP price must and will rise to meet bank transaction volume. 

One will either be in before it happens, or out.  Today is just an earthquake needle squiggling a bit before a Richter 10.0 hits. Who else read OMG and thought of OmiseGO token?Last post of the night!  So, if you took my analysis earlier today, you profited from the run up and got out.  We hit the support zone which I had indicated right at .215.  So bonus points for being spot on!  I stated on my twitter that I bought half my position at .2155.  I still have another half to go.  Either it will drop to .21 (possible) or jump to .22 (possible)  These are my half cent ranges that I like to use at this level.
It looks like there is a tight range in the .2155 and .217. Im not entirely sure which way it will go. Thats why I have half my position at .2155.  I can cost average both ways.  I would like it to drop so I can add more xrp.  If it starts to rise, i will look to get in at .218.  It has resistance at .22 so I am sure it would bounce in a small range before breaking through.

There could start to be more volatile price action overnight so be prepared.  It could jump in price, or it could fall.  I cant say for sure what will happen. The safe play is being in at .215.  It is just a nice number to be at. If it jumps to .23, you get a nice 8% bump. if it drops and you can buy in cheaper, you could get a better return on an increase.

Remember the goal here is to add as much xrp without adding more funds.  Once it starts to take off, those few thousand more will lead to bigger bucks.  When the price gets to a certain number, the strategy will begin to transform. We wont be looking at percentages, we will be looking at pennies.  Then with having 25k xrp, a penny movement will be worth $250 each time.  ye.. or just hodl, the risk of selling and restocking can also work against you and u can end up with -10% of what you had or even nothing. go daytrading with that strat for options, fine, but not for the actual stock imoIt has been a couple of hours and we have dropped from the highs.  Looking at the chart, there is resistance at .2255.  We have been in the .223 to .224 range.  A lot of sideways action in the last hour.  We had sell action at the beginning with a downward trend and since has leveled off.  Buyers are trying to push it up, and failing.  The volume right now isnt very strong.  I expect volume to pick up.

The easiest course is to the downside. I did sell my position at .225 and I am waiting for a good entry point below .22.  I have stated several times, I like the half cent ranges to make trades. This is unless there is high volume to the sell side, I will wait.

Do not panic if you are waiting on the sidelines and you see it jump.  There is a huge resistance level at .23.  If it breaks that level, you can get in at that level because the price is likely to rise to .24 and you can get your profit there.  

Look to get in on dips in the .222 range if you want the half cent trading range.  Otherwise, look for lower ranges to get inMy last post was about 30 mins ago. Since then it did, in fact, drop to .22.  This is a half cent decline in 30 minutes.  It is right on the .22 support zone.  This is a very important time in regards to price.  If it goes below, it could drop to the .215 zone in which it was yesterday.  That range was .205 to .215.  Any number in there could be reached.  i dont think it will go that far.  Look for  an entry in the .21 to .215.  That is a big IF it drops below .22

Right now the support has not been breached.  It could bounce off of this zone and get back to the .223 area. We could see it volley back and forth. If this does happen, and you are on the sidelines, the .22 zone is your entry point.  If you arent comfortable, you can sit and wait to see which way it goes.  If it bounces, a good spot will be the .223 to .2245 area.  

Personally, I am still waiting for the dip below .22 before I jump back in. My buy order hasn't been set yet. I want to see what it does if and when it dips below .22.  Otherwise, my entry will be around .22 if the price stabilizes at that zone.  Id like to get close to .21 as I can to get in.I received a nice message and an idea. I will post most of my analysis on twitter. I will still post here as well. I think it will be a good medium to reach more people, plus open up to more interaction across more media.

2017-09-17 23:15:41;If there's only 38 billion XRP available to trade, why would the 55 billion lockup have any effect on the current price?;As far as I understand, the current price reflects the uncertainty around the possibility that Ripple could dump a load of coins and screw us all over.  If they put them in escrow then we know there's at least a limit to how much they can dump, therefore giving them less chance of affecting the price.   Confidence that Ripple isnt doing to dump a crap load of xrp onto the market. Until xrp receives substantive adoption/usage it's price is largely impacted by speculation. The total* supply lends to that speculation. It probably wont increase the price.

2017-09-17 21:42:35;Going to the moon vs failure;"I got into XRP when it was $0.0069.  I have added to it along the rise but last time I bought any was in May at 18 cents.  I still think the current price is a great entry point to something which I believe will go much higher but I have capped my own investing at this point because it's a good idea to be diversified. I hold a few different cryptos and I have some stocks and shares.  Nothing is certain but I have lots of confidence that Ripple the company will be massively successful.  The world is changing and banks may be gone one day  but Ripple is a small step towards the future without being the revolution Bitcoin fans are looking for just yet. There's more money to be made before the current system disappears. Look at electric cars; these industries will be revolutionary and world changing, but there's still a lot of money to be made in gasoline and Lamborghinis.  
   I have faith that XRP will be a big part of Ripple's success. They genuinely intend on XRP being the ""primary digital asset used among global banks"". All of the movement we have seen with XRP has been speculation so far.  If and when banks use XRP the price will most likely explode.  

A higher value per coin is beneficial to Ripple so it's something they would like to see also

The next few months could be big and Swell conference in October will be great for Ripple and XRP awareness.  I would love to hear some big news from it but I also am prepared for a negative price effect if there's no ""mindblowing content"".

I believe it doesnt matter if we go to the moon or not. Ripple will succeed, it's a matter of time. There's always a risk of failure.i think in time it will become adopted.I also think that as a company Ripple is going to be very successful. But from investing viewpoint I can't say anything. I can add that after swell conference if price will not go up many little investors will lose the faith.Ripple is hiring like crazy. Check their jobs section and apply.Ripple's technology is awesome. I mean BANKS must have it for sure! It will help everyone, people here invested in something that exist and will be useful. I believe by the end of 2018 price will increase to 1-2 euros. Then it will show. Just my prediction, how I feel. We will see. Banks will never die, and if they adopt it then ... well you know ;)I backed it since the tech is useful and just because it is a bit different. I just wish i stepped in early, but it didn't show up on the exchange i wanted to use.We are in are comfort zone on Reddit.. everybody is like wait for this wait for that ... we'll be at the end of 2018 still waiting belive it or not.I backed ripple until I realised they are solving for bank that will solve for themselves, and even.if they succeed I could have had my money working way smarter in the meantime.

I play League of Legends and this is basically how Riot Games makes money.70k transactions per second is 6,048,000,000 transactions per day. If we [assume an average transaction cost](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/672a6t/ripple_burn_rate/) (xrp burn rate) of 0.000362175 xrp, this means we'll burn 2,190,434.4 xrp/day if we max out the capacity of the system to process transactions, and 800,056,164.6 xrp/yr.

XRP will burn out in just under 125 years, assuming everyone with XRP is conducting transactions. This timeframe doesn't take into account that plenty of people are hodling, so it'll be interesting how XRP/USD changes over the next few years.Hodor, man you are smart !

2017-09-24 22:23:51;Exchanges & The Future of Decentralization;"Brings up some real issues Hodor! I believe in Decentralization but lets be honest governments will never allow it completely. Maybe 2500 when massive networks are everywhere but now there is tight control over everything. Part of the reason I like Xrp and Ripple is because they took both approaches trying to marry both systems together. Excellent blog! Really got my head thinking about how this is true but I believe that government censorship, while disturbing, can be good. For instance, shutting down these scam ICOs was a good thing IMO. But some points you make are valid. 

If you ever need an idea for a blog by the way, here’s one. “What can the community do to help Ripple achieve their goal?” or even boost the general crypto market. Just some food for thought :).Hodor!Amazing and thoughtful blog as usual Hodor. 

I just had to a make an observation: What can or can we not learn from BitTorrent and peer to peer file sharing network. As far as I am aware, it's success was easily cracked down on by governments directing ISPs to simply block the BitTorrent traffic. 

As for anonymity, this is also a hard problem because once we can deduce that some potential cryptocurrency traffic moved from endpoint A to endpoint B, then governments require ISPs to have KYC wrt to IP addresses.Thoroughly enjoyed this write up!

Always looking forward to reading what your next blog post is about 😊Great insight! Business is good with Ripple, and All's Right With the World!

Are you familiar with [The World Exchange](https://www.theworldexchange.net/)?

2017-09-24 18:16:33;Weekend Trade Talk on XRP;"I was hoping for a little bump in price tommorow and Tuesday but it seems you are more pesimistic. I'm planning on waiting the last days of the month out of the exchanges with some usdt, waiting for a good moment to jump back in.I'm looking to add a couple thousand XRP to my holdings in the coming weeks. Going to be great :)if you post regularly in reddit, i'm sure you gonna have a huge fan base.Hey everyone. Today we saw a nice run up in Bitcoin and xrp.  We reached a level in the .187 range before settling to our current position at .183/.184.

To continue the upward trend, we have to continue to extend toward the .19 level. If we reach .187 again and it starts to fall, its a spot you can take some profits, and look for a re-entry in the .182 to .18 level.  
It looks like we are firmly in the .18 range now which is great news from the past few days of very light volume and price action.
Don't worry about the low volume trades that are reducing the price, this can easily be wiped out by larger buy orders.  If there is a pattern of high volume sell orders (30K plus) (I use Kraken, 1 min, heiken ashi view) If we reach above .1855 and large sell orders start to come in, we know its a good spot to take some profit.

We are in an upward trend and it won't be broken until it falls below .179 which is a good support level.  We definitely found a range today between .179-.187, almost a full cent and about a 5% difference.  This action can lead to profitable moves and expect the uptrend to continue if Bitcoin breaks $4,000 and we can break .19.  We still have a high ceiling of .199 at the moment, so dont expect prices to suddenly burst to the .20s.

I am going to post a full analysis later today on the group page (www.patreon.com/Riordan_85)  I hope new traders take a look and receive valuable information on what the price action of today means.  We have had a good run today and we good have another leg up toward .19 before settling back to the low to mid .18 range. 

Happy trading!"

If hackers must get the key to access funds, how would you say they got your key?Mmm your password could've been a little short or easy I'm sry man that sucks : / 
Would be a good investment to get a ledger nano sI'm sorry to hear about this man. You are in Canada, make sure you file a police report and get some official paper-work for your own records, regardless of whether it will be fruitful now, it might be in the future.[removed]Just checked my ripple account after many months and mine has been hacked aswel 😵"

It's a domestic transfer system with a high barrier for entry that many banks won't deal with. Even if it does work en masse, Ripple will connect to it via ILP. It's *maybe* good news, but probably neutral.https://ripple.com/insights/australia-embraces-faster-smarter-payments/

With swell coming up, long term upside could potentially be realized and the the market is getting pinched.Any price prediction? It's because it's monday morning in Korea and the market has openedProbably preliminary FOMO leading up to SWELL.Demand"

https://i.imgur.com/moN2XRn.jpgMaking money from Ripple this week boys and girls !!Just bought in, about 2k XRP.

Fingers crossed that by Halloween we're all in great spirits!Might as well believe in santy clauseHi guys, I’m pretty new to ripple. I’ve invested in other cryptos, and am seriously considering ripple but I had a few questions. Where is ripple going to get its value from since its essentially infinitely created? Or am I understanding ripple wrong? I know bitcoin and litecoin will only ever have X amount of coins, but with ripple, and I may be understanding incorrectly, can’t the coin be created by the push of a button? Also, I had heard major banks own ripple. Which honestly was kind of drawing me towards ripple as it has major backers. Can anyone explain to me why ripple has a monetary value? I know this is probably a dumb question, but say ripple is worth 10usd and 50,000 new xrp are created. Wouldn’t that almost immediately drop the value as it’s essentially creating money out of nothing? Or am I wrong to compare it to our dollar and it losing 98% of its value due to inflation and endless money printing?

If this isn’t the place to ask my apologies, I’m genuinely interested in investing in ripple, just wanted to better understand it first. Go Ripple Go. In on Epic post It's easy to believe in ripple.  The real question is whether you believe in humanity. ScaryI am assuming you go 50k+ xrps. Good luck to you!I believe in God, but in XRP I pay"

2017-10-15 21:38:00;https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/foreign-exchange/articles/blockchain-to-accelerate-payment-processing-services/;You have posted a screenshot of a tweet from someone called MyBarbecue , linking to an old (also reposted) article from before spring this year,  to try and give credit to a rumour spawned from a photograph of a phone screen showing a dubious email.  Another great post from Sanfrancrypto. You think you're helping but you're not Mabey Dipping Sauce was right?🤦🏽‍♂️Crickets?!  Haha did you expect me to come back to a post from 40+ days ago to pat you on the back for basically reposting a rumour that had already been mentioned about 10 times on this subreddit that week?   You offered no new info of any substance to the rumour and I stand by my decision to mock you for posting a screenshot of a rumour tweet from a barbecue company.  Idiot https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/foreign-exchange/articles/blockchain-to-accelerate-payment-processing-services/Old news. Pretty sure it doesn't even mention Ripple.
