2014-02-13 14:58:50;An open letter to Vitalik and the Ethereum Team: Don't let your fire consume you;"That was a beautiful post, thank you.

I'm well aware that this whole project might fail. Governments might all choose to take a strong stance against cryptocurrency and DAOs, people would lose interest, Bitcoin would drop to $10 and we would then have no real reason to keep going forward. BTC is an incredible risky space that can go to the moon, into a puddle or anywhere in between, and we're inextricably tied to that at the very least.

I have been in very deep despair before; aside from the episode of unrequited love in high school that basically deprived me of any opportunity for consistent happiness for most of a year, perhaps the worst was in late 2012 when the team behind Bitcoin Magazine, which I had sacrificed every opportunity to go out with friends or socialize in university to write for for about a year, was on the verge of falling apart due to internal strife. People who I thought were responsible adults who knew they were doing, and who I thought I could trust and count on, turned out to be my enemies. Luckily, we survived, but at the cost of selling 60% of the company for close to nothing and by the skin of our teeth. And then in March 2013, at what seemed to be the height of our glory, I remember staying up past 1:00 in the morning for the first time in two years when the Bitcoin blockchain forked, I was watching the price rapidly tank from $47 to $38, and I literally felt as if some close family member was in an emergency room and was dying in front of my eyes. So you're talking to a battle-scarred serial entrepreneur here (which I think we all have the right to call ourselves after what we've been through), not a delicate child. We'll be fine.Nice post - having been part of 3 web startups I know all too well what you're describing.

For what it's worth, Vitalik is by far the most level-headed person I've ever met throughout my career, regardless of age. The project is in good hands. 
I say the fire that burns IS an unlimited resource IF the goal of the work you are doing is for the good of all- if its selfless- 

IF the work you are doing is selfish- then yes it is limited and you will burn out and/or turn to drugs etc-

I believe that the end goal of the Ethereum project is to make the world a better place because of what its going to make possible- a selfless goal- a noble goal-

Whenever true genius shows up- people seem to try to get the person to be ""reasonable"" and work ""within their limits"" How can anyone know what the limits are? They can't!

You can't do the ""impossible"" if you adhere to other peoples limits-

I know that Nikola Tesla's friends urged him to not work so hard but he could see things no one else could- he hit targets no on else could see and worked towards his goal tirelessly- and the whole of humanity is glad he did.> I encourage you to temper your inner fire. Do not burn it too brightly, do not succumb to mania. The fuel which it burns is not a limitless resource.

I'm reminded of this scene:

2014-02-13 10:23:40;First Ether Forwards Exchange Opens;"This is a bit problematic. Theoretically, we may well decide to redenominate back to 10000 ether per BTC, or 1 ether/BTC, or even some model where we release 10000000 ether and split it proportionately among buyers. So being long or especially short ether at this point in time (and someone has to be short, since a total of 0 ether have been sold/released) is insane IMO. Once we finalize the terms, however, then things like this might be viable.

Also clarifying that this platform is not affiliated with us.I've had that question dozen of times today - Ethereum is not in touch with Peercover. We are trying to make contact. Peercover can you please explain a bit more about this project?what is your guarantee that you don't run away with my money?There are complicated issues that we (Ethereum.org) need to resolve before we can make any clear statements about the initial ether sale.  Any action taken by any individuals or groups before we release official documents is premature and may lead to a significant loss.  

While we are aware of and have respect for the work peercover.com is doing, they are in no way officially associated with Ethereum Project, do no speak for it, and are, in our opinion, doing a disservice to the Ethereum Project and possibly leading their own clients into a situation that they don't understand.  Offering to sell ether that doesn't yet exist, to naive purchasers, can only be considered irresponsible at this point.  Buyer beware.

We request that peercover.com cease to offer ether forwards, until there is more information released on The Ethereum Project, the potential value of the ether cyptofuel, and until lawyers in various countries clarify what the securities and regulatory issues might be in selling ether to the public in various countries.

And of course, peercover.com, please feel free to reach out and discuss with us how we may work together in the future.  Thank you.

2014-02-13 05:22:01;Which DAC/DAO projects could we try to convince to use ethereum? Here is a link to a list of some.;
2014-02-20 20:51:13;Some possibilities for financial DAOs;"Setting aside the free-wheeling, assertion-laden OP text in general, the concept of a DAO-based credit union or mutual S&L is intriguing.  A cooperative financial middleman potentially could reduce the net fee structure of the commercial banking system at least for participants.  Within a cooperative/mutual structure stake, identity, reputation could be built.  This is analogous to the local S&L where borrowers and depositors generally came from the same community and knew each other even when the books were private to the banker.
As to some of the other grandiose, dramatic and colorful claims in the OP, I suggest some qualudes and a bit more attention to the basic blocking and tackling of financial intermediation.  There are, in fact, many reasons borrowers go to lending institutions and investors to deposit takers rather than publicly marketing their project or evaluating the global universe of investment options.What we need is a a tree of the different types of services and organizations that could be turned in to DAO's or DA somethings+/u/fedoratips 100 tips"

Same goes for ethereumI'd also like it if Ethereum can deliver a nice GUI for non-developers to create their own DAC's, contracts, currency, bitshares, colored coins and so on. I think that's ultimately the goal, and I think innovation and adoption would *explode* if they did that. 

We need to get the point where a mom-and-pop online store can make a DAC even more easily than they can make their own LLC in the real world. I think that's the dream, and that's when you will see huge adoption of Ethereum as a platform for all sorts of stuff we can't even imagine now."
2014-02-20 03:28:48;A possible way to reduce blockchain size;"A block in Ethereum already stores the complete state alongside the tx list, so new clients can ""start in the middle"" and work without having to verify the whole chain, and then discard the history after a few thousand blocks to save space.Interesting but might have been better suited to /r/bitcoin as Ethereum is not UTXO based.Why not just have the client store only unspent transaction outputs? If I remember correctly the UTXO set is still less than 1GB.

Simpler, and accomplishes the same thing, unless I'm not understanding something."

2014-02-27 11:36:24;Having trouble downloading ethereum through go.;"Most likely the installer set your GOROOT but not your GOPATH, you will have to do that yourself. I would advise you to create a folder in your documents called go-projects or similar and then set your the GOPATH to this value.

To set this path do the following, i'm paraphrasing since my Windows installation sadly isn't English:

* Open the control panel
* Use the search option to search for ""Setting the environment variables for this system""
* Look for the button that says ""Environment variables""
* Press the button ""new""
* Name should be GOPATH and the value should be the folder you just created (copy the path via the explorer)

2014-02-26 12:08:24;Could code obfuscation remove the need for centralization?;"A scripts behavior is also basically proven to be calculated correctly by agreement on the results in the blockchain, so a script making a block is basically circular; a theorem being proven with an argument being itself.

Basically i expect it is essentially a build-in i think that if you have 25%, and you try to fork a block, you can just run that script as if the longer blockchain doesnt exist and nothing is wrong. The script can be made not to object, unlike full nodes not in control of the attacker.. Basically in effect the block would be an extension of the block before it.

Btw/ftr contracts, DAOs etcetera are just script analogues of pre-bitcoin relationships in the world. Scripts are really both more and less than that.Afaics every script that is somehow a 'permanent fixture', with no connections to particular people, and that somehow never loses too much funds to get deleted is essentially equivalent to being a feature of ethereum. 

I cant answer your question, but the above implies ubfuscating privkeys into ethereum itself, not scripts would do the same.

Also, that is a *strong* statement. I.e. if you could for instance have 'magic infinite funds' for something like the [dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflsmuz), basically having that file could be used for mining! 

Note afaict the dropbox scheme does not actually pay for serving the data to people.. Got [a concept](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1yvr3a/bitcoins_price_fall_will_affect_ethereums_launch/cfoa3j4) for that too, but with inflation subsidy servers would create fake viewers. Basically it cant be taken for granted that mechanisms cant be played.

Still, many scripts could be subsidizable with inflation, and not be fraudable.(i dont quite know)

Anyway, a little inflation may be a good thing, but it does beg the question who should get the coin. Regular mining is wasteful, so these are interesting, and that it can be done with script is aswel. Perhaps sub-currencies of ethereum could do it internally.

That said, i dont quite know how to give such a sub-currency value, ethereum itself could presumably only do it, but we currently only have relatively limited practical knowledge of scripts. Voting on scripts that would subsequently get some limited-to-the-desired-inflation 'magical funds' is an idea, but voting might presumably done by weight of coins, so there is a danger to overcentralization of coin through it..

Some of this is kindah like a government, but the taxation is inflation."
2014-03-06 21:15:26;Conditional futures for DAOs to outsource decision-making;"Essentially you're describing [futarchy](http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html), invented by economist Robin Hanson. People bet on what would happen if various actions were taken, the decision-maker takes whatever action has the best odds of success, and bets on actions not taken are nullified. His paper has details on setting up the bets, I suspect it could easily be implemented in Ethereum.

Hanson describes it as a way to run the government, with people voting on what to optimize. That seems a bit impractical to me. Lots of little futarchies like you describe might work out better. Various actors could choose to optimize whatever they want, and let the market help them decide what's most likely to work.See [this discussion](http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/2720#Comment_2720) on the Ethereum forum about Malicious Contracts and DACOs (Decentralized Autonomous Criminal Organizations)I'd really appreciate any feedback y'all have on whether conditional futures are:

2014-03-05 22:56:33;I am doing some research and would like to hear your opinion on next-generation cryptos;"[deleted]Afaik ethereum can do basically everything the others can do. The others largely have features that arent really up my alley.(but i think i should learn more about the financial ideas behind them)

The main weakness of ethereum is essentially the full-scripting thing, which people often think is prone to bugs. Though it it definitely something to really try hard to keep secure,(which bit of cryptocurrencies arent..) I am not too worried about it. Javascript has had and probably has a lot of security bugs, but interfaces with a lot, ethereum script basically interfaces with stuff that ethereum developpers *also* made, and with a lot less, i reckon.

The second worry/weakness is that the computation and storage of contracts is just too much data to hold on to. Which would hurt volume it can handle, and/or drive the cost of fees up. This one is basically the main worry i have, despite the good lightweight-client thing. That said, if i can be sure there are enough full-nodes out there and the lightweight-client thing works, might already suffice.

Afaik the mechanisms the blockchain works with, the mining etcetera is not exactly set in stone. Fairly confident they're going the right direction. (but not through knowing the direction myself)

The possibilities of the ethereums scripts are enormous, and they are just being explored. Escrow without third party, crowdfunding, subcurrencies, namecoin, dropbox, 'serving and viewing'(not sure of that, dont get responses about it :) ), self-enforcing contracts, (like)self-enforcing rules for organizations, approaches to identify persons to try figure out how to do UBI.

Btw i use the word scripts.. Heard the word (self-enforcing-/smart-)contracts used too, but the problem is that the word contract doesnt always quite fit the bill, script is fairly accurate, but it carries connotations. It is just basically a little program, and most of them would probably be basically from some standard set, with some parameters filled in.Hm... dont know really but i will for sure follow your blog for a while now.It's worth mentioning twister, it's possibly the most interesting Blockchain around!"

Here's the next step. Ethereum contracts can hold more than just ether, and some assets that an ethereum contract might own (eg. smart property) are not necessary divisible. The general incentive-compatible solution to that problem is a standard cake-cutting protocol: [one cuts, and the other chooses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_choose).

2014-03-13 13:42:57;How can we estimate the cost of computation and contract execution on Ethereum?;"By simulating a run of a contract you can calculate what the cost [1] of running it would be for various code paths. This cost is in `basefee` units, which is currently hardcoded [2] to be 100 szabo.

[1] https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper#fees
[2] https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/blob/master/libethereum/State.cpp#L72
These costs need to be kept low as the success of the whole enterprise depends on the proliferation of new ideas in the form of contracts. The people with the best ideas will not always be the ones with most ether. The danger is that the only contracts that are viable are those that generate a huge income, rather than those that fulfil a useful function.

Some nice contracts to see early on would be like basic 'operating system' utilities that provide building blocks,  'pipes' etc. that can be joined up to perform more complex tasks. If the fees are too high, there will be a barrier to creating 'public service' type infrastructure, and people will focus on developing fancy financial instruments and 'get rich quick' schemes that will hinder widespread adoption IMHO.Given the floating nature of the .basefee determined by democratic mechanisms, contract costs can vary from negligible to prohibitive. Ideally, if the economics _and_ democratic process works out, this would be something in between the value people ascribe to getting their contracts executed and costs of running the network. The latter being determined by PoW/computation costs while hugely depending on the scale of the network.
I think it is the right time, that ethereum devs disclose a rundown of their economic model including different scenarios to kickstart people's own conclusions and understand the long-term viability. As mentioned before, scalability or conversely decoupling from increasing marginal costs are the most important factors costwise.I think you may have the old whitepaper.

Will this be locked in a contract (that releases it over time) or available to the organization immediately?

The organization will already be getting plenty of BTC (which is not locked in any way) so I hope you guys end up locking the 0.4x ether.The paper is brilliant. However, on the following:

>to avoid argument (see the current mBTC/uBTC/satoshi debate in Bitcoin), the denominations will be pre-labelled:
>1: wei

>10^3: lovelace

>10^6: babbage

>10^9: shannon

>10^12: szabo

>10^15: finney

>10^18: ether

While I understand you wanting to honor computer science and cryptography heroes, having to learn these denominations sets artificial entry barriers and makes it difficult for newcomers to understand what unit is bigger than the other. I was having trouble myself when running the POC client and having to look up what these were to understand what was going on. 

I suggest we drop these denominations, use International prefixes like with any other scientific unit of measure people are already used to. We want things simple and with fewer denominations if possible. 
Typo: ""This means that Bitcoin mining is **now** longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit""Great! Found some spelling:

""so legitimate miners will work on the 270005 chain while the attacker **along** is working on the 270000 chain.""Is there an nlocktime, or must this be managed internal to the contract?

Does the contract still have some free GAS, to determine if it should continue execution? I am unsure what the purpose of the 0.4x reserve is.

The currency sale seems easily sufficient to fund the organization and to compensate for development, in a way that rewards those who adopt ethereum as well.

Is there something that the 0.4x reserve (or whatever level may be decided in the end) achieves that the currency sale cannot?

In principle an ethereum contract could be created that somehow enforces growth through ['budding'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budding). And perhaps a route for downsizing needs to exist aswel.

However, given no reasons to think otherwise, assume it is *trivial* for a 'cancerous' replab to just bud things to adresses the same group of people actually controls. This may overlap with the 'one-human-one-identity' problem, and/or trust/reputation systems."
2014-04-10 22:58:38;The Issuance Model in Ethereum, by Joseph Lubin;"From the white paper:

>0.4x the total amount sold will be allocated to the organization to compensate early contributors, pay ETH-denominated expenses before the genesis block and as a long-term reserve [NOT FINALIZED]

The quoted section is not mentioned in the issuance model. Is the total supply at 1 year 1.3 times the presale, or 1.7x? Thanks.A)

> One of the many ways we intend to foster inclusiveness is by maintaining an issuance system which possesses some churn.  New participants in the system will be able to purchase **new** ETH or mine for new ETH whether they are living in the year 2015 or 2115.


What do you mean ""purchase **new** ether""?. 

In the text you explain Ether is created only for for investors in the pre-sale (not saying how many ether will be mined for the ethereum team), and the rest of the ether has to be mined, reducing the issuance over time just like bitcoin. But then you say new participants can either mine it or ""buy **new** ether"".

So? from where does this ""new"" ether come from?

B)

> ""Though the issuance of ETH is in a fixed amount each year, the rate of growth of the monetary base (monetary inflation) is not constant.""


As far as i understand, one thing is a fixed issuance and another a fixed growth rate. Fixed issuance means that, for example 18,000,000 ethers will be created each year, 18,000,000 in 2014 and also 18,000,000 in 2140. But if the growth of the monetary base is supposed to shrink via mining reward reduction how can you issue 18,000,000 in 2140?

So? Is someone aside miners issuing Ether?

C)

> ""And the constant issuance, especially in the early years, will likely make using ETH to build businesses in the Ethereum economy more lucrative than hoarding speculatively."" 


I'm not a selfish man but i'm in for the speculative side of the game, while i admit a don't understand very well the text you guys just posted,reading that last line makes me think, why would i invest in early stages of ethereum if i can't play the speculative game? Wouldn't it be smarter then to just buy if i'm going to actually build something? which most people won't do at the beginning, just like most bitcoins are not used to actually purchase."

2014-04-10 17:35:33;Ethereum in a nutshell;"Funny (I love xkcd), but Ethereum is a programming framework, not a competitor to bitcoin/altcoins. So there will be other 'Ethereums' I'm sure, just like there's C++ vs JAVA vs Python etc. They can all be used to build apps, right tool for the job is the way to go :)That's like having a type of train and a rail road, and calling them ""competing standards"".[Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

**Title:** Standards

**Transcript:** HOW STANDARDS PROLIFERATE

(See: A

C chargers, character encodings, instant messaging, etc.)



SITUATION:

There are 14 competing standards.



Geek: 14?! Ridiculous! We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use cases.

Fellow Geek: Yeah!



Soon:

SITUATION:

There are 15 competing standards.



**Title-text:** Fortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we've all standardized on mini-USB. Or is it micro-USB? Shit.

2014-04-17 18:17:29;ELI5: What is the difference between Ethereum and Nxt?;"I'm not deep into NXT so here's what I see as the differences:

* NXT is trying to do multiple things at the same time, trying to get all the best features of alt coins into it. Ethereum instead is trying to build a platform focused on only on the contracts and Decentralized Apps, imagining that anything useful can be built on top of it

* Neither one of them has released a fully functioning smart contract currency. NXT already has a currency working but contracts AFAIK are ""in the works"". Ethereum is focusing on building the contracts, is currently in POC stage.

* They have different funding mechanisms and different levels of transparency. Ethereum starts with a premine distributed among miners and developers and then new coins will be mined by proof of work, NXT started 100% pre mined and funds are secured using proof of stake

* Ethereum is pledging to be completely open. NXT keeps some of it's development code private and releases open source of the more mature builds. Also NXT has purposefully added a few security bugs that it keeps secret in order to attack any alt coins based on their code, Ethereum has none of that.

* NXT is out, Ethereum is not

I think that's the gist of it. NXT wants to be the best alt coin on the market. Ethereum wants to be the next web platform.From what I've seen of Nxt, their code implements every transactional contruction which is available on the system. And if they want to expand the capabilities of the technology, they need to expand the code.

With Ethereum, the basic code could remain relatively stable and optimized in a way that anybody with ether can create any new transactional capability and store it in the blockchain so anybody else can use it.

So similar to how companies sometimes create a single monolithic program which contains all the features, well thoughout and optimized for efficiency.. other companies like to offer their users extensibility and create a single base program which can be expanded with plugins which allows a full range of possibilities."

2014-04-17 13:35:59;Ethereum vs. Ripple: where should I place my crazy speculation money?;"Ethereum isn't available for purchase yet. So wait and seeIt's important to consider factors other than the technology when deciding on a company to invest in. 

For example, Ripple no longer has it's founder (Jeb McCaleb), also despite it's big name executives and substantial venture capital funding it has thus far failed to attract any significant interest. This is easily seen by analyzing the price of xrp, the trade volumes into and out of the ripple network, as well as transaction volume on the platform itself. 

On the other hand, even before it's launch, Ethereum has managed to gain a large developer community as well as self-finance a large portion of it's early endeavors.

One can also compare size of each company's social media footprint.You clearly don't know much about them, so the best advice is: neither. Make some time to read more about them, try to understand both, what impact they have. 

Personally I'd prefer if you kept your crazy speculation money on crazy speculative currencies and take time to think about what you can build in ethereum.

Honestly I really like Ripple and I have a bit of them. But I've been following them for a long time and I don't see much progress on the platform or their XRP distribution..I like Ripple a lot and I've been a big supporter of them. But my enthusiasm for it has been waning for several reasons. Firstly their progress on contracts is moving very slowly (last I heard, they hadn't yet hired the person who will implement them).

Secondly they were making a series of non-technical hires while bugs remained unfixed for months. Just one example, it was impossible for a new rippled node to download the full ledger from other nodes. they suspect a bug is slowing down the transfer but nobody had bothered to track it down, last i checked. Sorry but I'm not going to volunteer my time to do debugging for a paid team of devs, and it appears few other people want to do so either.

Last but not least there's Jed McCaleb and the collapse of MtGox which happened in his wake. He sold MtGox to Mark Karpeles under a profit-sharing agreement, and under that agreement he had auditor access to MtGox (I don't know for how long, but correct me if I'm wrong on this). I'm not aware of any statements Jed has made since the collapse, and if he hasn't well that seems pretty sketchy, though I haven't had the time to do a thorough search yet. In any case, the recent gox episode does not inspire confidence in Jed or anyone connected to him, to say the least.Bitshares still sound the best to me. The new DPOS whitepaper looks very promising.

2014-04-23 22:45:00;why can't we let ethereum use bitcoin as its currency?;"Every computational step done on Ethereum, including sending transactions will require tiny payments, so the best analogy in my opinion is that ether is the fuel that powers the execution of distributed applications on the Ethereum platform.

Trading back-and-forth between bitcoin and ether should be quick and easy.  We are working to have exchanges list ether, ATMs sell ether and are also working on methods of having bidirectional ether to bitcoin gateways (much like a sidechain). Ethereum has very different design goals from Bitcoin and we expect both to grow in tandem.

Using bitcoin as the fundamental token on our implementation or on any clone of Ethereum would be problematic.  Our issuance model for ether and security model for the network are intertwined.  We need a large number of miners to operate and secure the network with transaction processing and proof of work.  And we need to incentivize them to do so.  We can't incentivize them with bitcoin in perpetuity.  It would be expensive for us to buy that much bitcoin (not to mention foolish).  We need a token, intrinsic to the network, that miners will perceive as valuable.  Therefore this should be the same token that undergirds all commerce and computation on the platform.  Network demand for ether combined with network security and processing as the main source of ether sets up a positive feedback loop which grows the ecosystem.

[deleted]Ether isn't just a currency, it's the fuel for the Ethereum network. Bitcoin wouldn't work as this fuel (since it's external to Ethereum and not under the control of the system). The common metaphor used for ether is oil, so it's like you're saying ""Why introduce oil when we already have the US dollar?""Didn't even know Lanier wrote about Bitcoin, guess I'll have to read it, thanks for that. http://www.jaronlanier.com/futurewebresources.html""We have to create a decentralized economy to save the world from job loss from automation and robotics"".

No man, we have to create a decentralized economy to save ourselves from the control of centralization. Aren't you tired of people making decisions for you which benefit them (not you), without your permission or knowledge? Use any currency (besides government) and you will be doing it for the freedom and good of generations to come.Because bitcoin's distribution is disproportionately favored towards the ASIC miners and heavily burdens the very people Ethereum is trying to reach.

Because ""we"" aren't the people who are developing Ether. The devs need to eat and pay rent somehow and selling their own coins is a very good way to do it.

Because the mining protocol for bitcoin does not help with the functions that best run contracts on Ethereum.

Because Satoshi Nakamoto has enough money already."

There will be three layers of Ethereum, the blockchain / main client, a messaging system, and a file store system like bit torrrent.

2014-05-07 11:43:28;So we're a group of pretty good developers and designers and would like to get involved with ethereum, but we have some big questions;"1. A lot of people have the mistaken impression that because Ethereum allows for ""computation"" it is necessarily going to be much slower than Bitcoin, which just does ""verification"". This is completely false. Fees will be sufficiently high that no one will actually attempt to implement any algorithms more complicated than cryptographic verification and basic business logic inside of Ethereum code, so we expect Ethereum contract-based transactions will only be slightly more expensive to process than in Bitcoin. In fact, space-wise Ethereum is more efficient than Bitcoin because unlike Bitcoin, where each account needs to store many separate unspent transaction outputs, in Ethereum each account needs to store only 100 bytes no matter how many transactions it has; hence, the efficiency of the two systems should be comparable.

2. PoW right now. We're looking at useful-PoW and PoS heavily though. The biggest problem with POS that I'm seeing is the long-range-attack problem (basically, start a chain from 10k blocks back, and ""mine"" it with some small percentage of all coins until it's a billion times longer than the original, and then convince new users that that is the legitimate chain). We are looking into it heavily. Realistically, one likely alternative is that ETH1.0 will be pretty boring with some relatively good Turing-complete memory-hard PoW, and ETH2.0 will bring the real innovation in.

3. We're working together quite a lot in Switzerland. The general idea is that Ethereum is decentralized, while OT is a server-based system (though with federation and auditing protocols), so Ethereum's advantage is that it is more trust-free and zero-infrastructure, whereas OT has lower transaction costs, higher privacy and confirmation time. Thus, we expect OT servers to plug into the Ethereum blockchain via contracts, allowing specialized applications like Chaumian anonymization and HFT to happen on the server while more ordinary transactions are done on the blockchain.

4. At this point, either a counterparty-style proof of burn or a simple fork are the most likely options, but not too much is decided. The problem is that we don't really know what form ETH2.0 will take, so it's hard to be specific.For your question about Eth 2.0, see this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/24cw9p/what_will_ethereum_20_be/ and this comment in particular http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/24cw9p/what_will_ethereum_20_be/ch66lbd"

These are the types of apps that help Ethereum become more usefull for its users.This is a great idea, bounties are a fantastic tool for making the most of decentralization. Would you consider making it so some small proportion of successful bounties goes to the person who proposed the idea? This would incentivize more people to propose ideas that the public would consider useful but they might not have the skills or resources to execute themselves. Great project. But how does it solve the problem of trust with Ethereum more than any other currency? In order to release the funds, the owner must see the content and make a decision to release it or not, but since he already has the content, he could simply not release it.

This would be a much more interesting if it became a market for content: publishers and authors gartner reputations for their past actions, and since it's all on the blockchain both can provide proof that when they uploaded content that can help if anyone of them wants to claim a legal copyright dispute (outside ethereum, of course)
Adam B Levine is close to releasing the first of this content bounty idea as LTBcoin. He is platform agnostic and building on counterparty. Check out his writings, may add some more to your brief. This idea would be more flexible on ethereum in my opinion. Looking forward to seeing what comes of your project.Love the idea!

I'd like to participate!very good! the system is running well on a private chain atm, but i want to add some extra widgets for the user manager, and do some more tests. I stopped adding new things today (as i wrote this), just doing some final tests and polishing.

This should happen sometime in the middle of next week. worst case next weekend. Unless the blockchain breaks down or the client or something that is out of my control.


 I'll upload to the public chain a few days in advance, check for problems, then when it looks fine i will send out messages that it's ready.Ok there is a caveat here... In order to participate you have to run the dev version of cpp-ethereum. It's super easy to set up in ubuntu - just follow the install guide line-by-line. Not 100% sure of the status on windows/mac, but it works just fine in an ubuntu virtual box in win 8. 


Honestly, though, if you aren't into Ethereum already, or plan on getting in to it, setting up a dev build just for trying this out is a lot of work. There will be binaries and stuff later that makes it a lot easier, and this system isn't going anywhere.im in - i have forked Andy DAO and am looking at how to add comment action and upvote/downvote action along with an address and verification method.would love to test it out! pls sign me in :)Sign me up!ok i have run it on the public blockchain, but it is too late to get everything going today. seems like i might make it a bit ahead of time. perhaps sunday or monday (if things continue to work). I like the demo!  is there a way that I could create a user contract that gives read only access to the blockchain - no way possible to write comments to votes/just ability to vote up or down.

Could you show an example function of the vote file so that I can customize my own poll?

There are  some issues currently, that has to do with the ethereum core, but they do not seem to be in the way of a test run. In fact they might even be gone now.


Also - there is lots of new LLL stuff now, such as 'def' (which is pretty much like #define in C). It will make action/poll templates a lot easier to write and read.Change of plans, video here: http://youtu.be/NVupNB_uFwk. It will not be public yet.

2014-05-22 15:05:00;Do/will the high level languages have access to cryptographic primitives?;"Tbh, not sure, but afaik there are two approaches:

1. Write these in contracts, and then later make optimizations that does the equivalent as that contract.

2. Build them in, the fees can then be lower as it needent be run by (edited) interpreter

With 2 adding more later on is essentially a blockchain split between older and newer versions. Everyone has to update. With 1 the gas costs are higher, but i suppose you could make binary-code versions of contracts, and then allow votes to lower the gas cost of particular contracts. But there are security implications..

[This is a good blog post about it](http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/02/05/more-thoughts-on-scripting-and-future-compatibility/), mind that it was written pre-gas.Verifying signatures makes sense, but signing and encrypting data in contracts would require the contracts to have secret keys, and unless I'm missing something, there's no mechanism for that. As of right now -- sha3 is the only cryptographic machine instruction that the virtual machine executes -- as of the moment. Which is why you've found it in Serpent.

You can read all of the machine instructions here: http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf

A lot of this functionality by the virtual machine right now is rudimentary -- and I'm sure intended so that the developers of the clients are able to keep up, and implement an entire virtual machine. I'll bet a number of other functionality will be built into the spec for it as time goes on.

My biggest question is when will it look at the outside world, maybe another blockchain.

It's likely popular contracts will arise to abstract some of these lower level functions too -- which other contracts can make use of. "
2014-05-22 13:11:31;Ethereum ÐApps for Web Developers - Writing Your Own Currency;"Nice tutorial, it's great to see an example of the JS bindings in practice.

One thing I haven't seen much with custom currencies/meta currencies/sub currencies is discussion on getting them to talk to other contracts. If I've got, say, an exchange contract between a custom currency and ether, what's considered best practice for determining if an appropriate deposit of the custom currency has been made?

My current approach is basically to put following snippet after the transaction code in the currency contract:

    data = msg.data
    data[0] = from
    msg(to, msg.value, tx.gas, data, msg.datasize)

And then in the receiving contract check that the sender is the currency contract and process the data accordingly.
    Great write-up!

Might want to mention that go-eth doesn't yet connect to the global (cpp-eth) testnet. So to actually try this you'd have to do it on your own local genesis/chain. And to have funds in that (even just the gas for the contract), you'll have to hardcore in your own address. Right?

But when there's a stable PoC5 testnet and faucet, it should easier.I see there's a JS function: ""getCoinBase retrieves the address of your current account"". But there's also a [Serpent](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Serpent-programming-language-operations) pseudovariable ""block.coinbase - address of block miner"".

Might this be a little confusing to the average Joe webdev?"

2014-05-21 15:31:24;R&D DAO - Trust-less data-feeds, and Proof-of-Brain weighted voting.;"The example of creativity is very difficult to measure or show work, but I understand you're basically trying to measure something subjective that can be only measured by other humans. 

I believe you have two challenges to your proposal:

1) on the first DAO, how do you prevent a botnet to vote on a new median value? Of course it will be an equilibrium between how much this botnet costs and how valuable is that DAO's result. 

2) on the second DAO, there's a elite feedback. People with higher score have more weight on deciding other people score so there's a natural tendency to create an artificial elite. I'll rank higher people I know personally, people that speak my language, people with a style similar to mine, etc.. Even if it doesn't create a market that you can only get by being friends with the top guys, you create one where a particular set of skills that the first high tankers have  will have a tendency to rank higher and keep in the top. 

Let's say we use a minimal trust data-feed that starts by asking normal people to rate the car driving ability of random people.

Next, take the highest rated drivers, and ask them to rate the driving of random people.

Iterate this 10 times and what you're left with is the best drivers on the planet, evaluating peoples driving.

We could do this for just about anything.

It's turtles all the way up; an infinite progression solution.

edit: Biases may have an exponential effect, however.Thanks for a concrete example, I can see how this would work.

One issue I have is aren't you inherently finding not the most creative people but the median creative people in such a system? Isn't it essentially least common denominator?

I think this entity could work for pretty conservative tasks, but it is going to completely miss (for lack of a better example) the Steve Jobs or visionaries that are thinking differently from the average person.

The feasibility of Shilling Coin for good measurements also is an issue. It suffers from the possibility of a 51% attack, and in feeds without a large network, it would be pretty simple for a group to push the median to a value that is not accurate but benefits them.I would totally buy botnet time or clickworkers to vote me into the top 20%. That would cost a lot less than education and networking. ;-)

You're considering being a miner but you face the cost of a 100TB hard drive before you even begin.

""
When you make a promise to someone, it's important to keep your promise. When two people make an important promise to each other, they can write it down. This is a good idea. It helps them remember what they promised. 

But sometimes people argue later about what the words really mean. 

I can promise to give you a dollar if you clean up your room. We can write this down on paper. You might clean your room and ask me for the dollar. But I meant clean your room every day. You thought I meant clean it one time. The thing we wrote down meant something different to both of us. This caused a problem.  

Ethereum let's us write down our promise in a way that always means the same thing to everyone. Even a computer with no brain can know what it means. 

We tell the computer about our promise, and the computer tells lots of other computers. Everyone in the whole world can see the promise we made.

Ethereum lets us put the dollar inside the computer. The computer can make sure that we keep our promise. We can't change our mind. The promise we made is always kept.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clw-qf1sUZgOk, this is not going to be like you're 5 years old, because that really makes no sense. If you're really that old, go outside and play... this is grown up stuff :P

Ethereum is basically a re-envisioning of the Blockchain concept (assuming you know what that is) - this allows you to make transactions to addresses and those transactions are mined (assuming you know what that is). 

The big difference is where other 'cryptocurrencies' allow transactions to have certain scripts. a limited set of operation codes which perform specific functions like multi-signature transactions for example, Ethereum says: We are not going to limit you to certain scripts. You can write ANY script to a transaction. A full programming language at your disposal to write a script which will be stored on every node linked to its own address as a 'contract'

When you send another transaction with data to that contract-address, the script will be executed and can perform any number of functions (like looking up the block-number or balance of an address, sending a tx to another party, etc)

Those scripts could even define a new type of token which can be sent back and forth, through the usage of such a contract. Or you could set up the rules of a voting system, where only certain addresses have the right to send a vote.

All this will allow people to build entire business models around their own type of peer-to-peer token exchange backed by the decentalized blockchain data-structure.Someone should make a comparison between the traditional way of transaction and the ethereum way. Possibly how cryptocurrencies work too."
2014-06-11 15:40:11;Bitcoin is Myspace to Ethereum's Facebook.;"Bitcoin is like E-mail and ethereum is like javascript Analogies can be very useful to help people understand what ethereum is. I wouldn't say ""Bitcoin is Myspace to Ethereum's Facebook"" though, because it makes it sounds as if one precludes the other. 

Ethereum is a development and distribution platform for decentralized apps. By being developed on ethereum these apps automatically leverage technology enabling consensus at scale. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a specific application of consensus at scale technology (a currency). 

I don't see ethereum as an evolution or 'better' version of bitcoin, not at all. I particularly dislike the wording of 'bitcoin 2.0' - because bitcoin 2.0 will be just that, a newer version of bitcoin with more features. Bitcoin 2.0, when it comes, will be announced on this page: https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history

Appcoins is also a term I'm not a big fan of. There could be appcoins on top of ethereum (they are trivial to write), but ethereum itself is not an appcoin. Twister (http://bit.ly/1s5Vi4j) would be very straightforward to write on ethereum for example, and metacoins are so simple they are part of our very beginner tutorials (http://bit.ly/1s5VmB7). 

So, what's a good analogy? Well, the answer is I don't know, I guess we'd have to look back in history to find a parallel situation where the core technology from one specific project ended up being repurposed as part of a more generalist platform. I'm very curious and look forward to the conversation!

2014-06-19 20:10:17;Ethereum mining for beginners;"Your question is still premature. The only mining being done right now is on the testnet by developers (testnet ethers are worthless, the testnet blockchains get reset with new versions). There are two alpha clients in development. If you want to see what mining is like on the alpha clients, the build instructions are at the github wikis for [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum(Go%29) and [cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki).OK, like the others are saying, it's still up in the air a bit. But the following are good indications of where the project is headed. **It is total speculation at this point though**

**Pools** yes, there will and must be pools, but they will operate differently from Bitcoin pools in that their only advantage will be smoothing, pool operators can no longer decide what is or isn't on a block.

**CPUs vs GPUs** Ethereum will most likely include SHA3 for which there is no ASIC yet as well as random calculations, for which there theoretically cannot be ASICs. It will probably take some time for GPU code to be written to handle the mining process. So initially, really, really fast CPUs. GPUs are general purpose these days, so there will be a quick shift to using them for mining imo.

**RAM / Storage** /u/vbuterin has said that he will include proof of storage in the mining algorithm. So the software should eventually optimize to make use of massive amounts of RAM that can fetch blockchain items quickly. Initially you may want to store the whole blockchain on a RAM drive. Given how much RAM you can put in a machine, it will be quite a while before the block chain grows to consume that amount, so SSDs will probably be skipped.

**Software** there will probably be node/mining software that you need to update frequently since optimizations of the proof of random execution, proof of storage in software will be where the speed increases come from.

An example prototype of that can be find here
https://github.com/maran/dnseth

DNSEth is not just the contract code, but also an actual DNS server prototype that uses Ethereum as backend.> it is hard to view such digital entities as anything other than artificial intelligence.

It is *extremely hard* to see them as artificial intelligences. I mean, it has been hypothesized that you could make artificial intelligences that buy their own server space and stuff, but it is possibly a very difficult problem to prevent the AI from being scammed, exploited, or ensuring it actually gets executed properly on the servers.

The characterization as viruses is also a bit doubtful.. No such thing looks to be demonstrably workable.

The testnet already has a name registry. Do think they're not worked out far enough yet, i think. I expect a top level one, as *the point* is that the links must be sharable, you cant have difference of opinion on what names mean. And it must make names human-readable too. Sub-name registries should be possible, with their own 'business' models and goals. And it may be possible to-re-think what an url should look like too.. Really the `.org`, `.com`, `.net` are silly, and the country extensions are too, in many cases.

Maybe websites can organize their files as-if they're continuing the name registry pattern is possible. Well, just like `forum.ethereum` and `blog.ethereum`, etc.

What the 'model' of the top name registry on is, then is quite important. I dont like the prospect of people going about hoarding names, it is clearly not useful behavior. Some approaches:

* An 'existing name list' might be usable to limit it. I.e. if you can prove you are google.com, you can get google, and the guy that got is merely reinbursed. The list should be out in the open, of course. 

* Another method against hoarding is that you pay A initially, and βA can take it from you, for instance β=2. However, this is very much 'the richest gets the thing'.

* Yet another is to use votes from some constituancy to determine who gets a name. One case is software, votes from users could determine which fork is the main one. Additionally, dependencies can be used to send resources/money as a result of software downward. (Not my idea.. forgot where i got it)

That said, i have seen people consider 'context-sensitive' name system.. but havent heard anything that made me think it"

The term [web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) described the difference between static web pages and dynamic, html5-based ""web apps"" (resembling desktop applications, except in the browser). Crypto 2.0 is the use of decentralized smart contracts, applying blockchain tech beyond that of mere digital currency payments. Web 3.0 is ""decentralized apps"", i.e. apps that have backends which are smart contracts ""hosted"" directly on the blockchain - not intermediated through any third-party web servers.

> and the testnet is replaced by a live, fully functioning platform.

The testnet is a live, functioning platform. The alpha clients are starting to look more like beta software. All the opcodes are implemented, the script compilers work and even come with contract debugging tools. Of course there are still many bugs and kinks to work out (and, yes, hardening and security concerns).

> At that point, the monetary incentive inherent in digital currencies could bring in hordes of developers looking for ways to design contracts to bring their idea’s to life.

Developers who want to can already start building DApps on Ethereum (and test them on the testnet). They will have a first-to-market advantage over those who wait until the mainnet launches.

> Ordinary Ethereum simply accepts this third party data.

wat? Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and DApps, there is no ""ordinary"" way that it accepts third party data. Incorporating off-chain data is up to the DApp authors, there will be as many different ways to do it as there are DApps. There's a whole spectrum of possibilities here, including: trusted data feeds, semi-trusted oracles, and [SchellingCoin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/)-style voter consensus.

> Having semi-trusted oracles, with a reputation system for verifying contracts, of which multiple are required before a contract is completed and the transaction executed, would eliminate the need for trust by removing fear of a single oracle stealing funds.

Semi-trusted oracles don't eliminate the need for trust. Rather, they require selecting and coordinating a set of multiple third-parties, and then trusting them not to collude."

Very well written, highly insightful. Five stars for you sir!Hi Rob, thanks for this article. I'm glad to see some efforts being made to think through some implications of so-called smart contracts and DAO, etc., as they are as inchoate as they are novel - [this is something I've had a early crack at myself](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1yxm07/preliminary_critique_of_smartcontractsdaos/). I have just one question for you though, and it relates more to the premise of your article rather than the thought experiment you apply to Schellingcoins and the art market. 

You claim that:

>Bitcoin is an example of an accelerationist technology. It uses Internet-scale computing resources to rebuild social bonds by destroying the requirement for them in monetary exchange.

Straight after defining accelerationsm as

> A cloud computing-era spin on the old Marxist argument that we first need to perfect capitalism in order to transcend it

As I understand it, this is a mistake. Bitcoin is not something Marx's critiques of capitalism would have proposed. We must also be wary of the accelerationist appropriation of Marx, as opposed to what Marx had thought. Bitcoin only intensifies processes of exchange, by enabling the proliferation of decentralised networks of capitalist exchange; that goes for principles of real and abstract subsumption immanent to this exchange. What Bitcoin liberates and accelerates is p2p extraction of surplus value. This is not in any meaningful sense constitutive of a transcendence from capitalism but instead a *reconfiguration* of it. Or in other words, bitcoin is not an accelerationist vector in the slightest.

As I've mentioned previously, the truly revolutionary aspect of bitcoin is the blockchain, which can potentially be deployed for anti-capitalist ends. But sadly, I've yet to come across any projects, given the prevalence of AnCaps developing these platforms, that share in  accelerationism and anti-capitalism at once."

Another option thats particularly interesting in is the idea of the contract provider providing subsidies - something I know Vlad Zamfir and a couple of others have been studying.

Impossible until code obfuscation comes along, and that may always come with massive inefficiencies.

> I was stumped on whether a contract, when executing would be able to make use of randomness.

If you're relying on this for gambling, it's a bad idea. People can simulate the blockchain locally, so they'll be able to pre-detect which gambles will win and which will lose. A much better approach is to have the contract take the funds, wait 3-6 blocks for ""confirmations"", and then output a result where the RNG is the set of block hashes in the intervening interval.Basically you would use a RANDAO. Before that there was the idea of waiting for a  block hash in the future,(You cant use anything about which all the information is available at the point of betting) but that has a problem with miner collusions, the next idea is to have each party commit to random values with hashes, and later reveal them, but it is inconvenient. Finally RANDAO is a solution that basically outsources that. (more explanation [after ""The method that Denny's Lotto uses..""](http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/4380/#Comment_4380))If it's a Turing complete language then random numbers can be generated in the usual way - essentially combining unpredictable system statuses into a random number. So you'd have to be careful but you could use numbers from the network such as Ping values between users and time for hashes to be solved etc and combine them in an unpredictable way.

The underlying idea behind the endowment at this point is that of the total endowment, which is 0.3x the amount of ether sold, 2.8% is distributed each month, starting from Dec 2013 when the project began and continuing on all the way past the launch of the genesis block in an exponentially decreasing fashion forever (thus, there's no sharp distinction between ""founder"" and someone doing some work in 2015, it's completely a sliding scale). My own share is currently the largest, roughly equal 0.013x the amount sold, ie. 0.46% of the supply after 5 years; the next few people after me get about 0.30% each. Once again though, this info is not final; pending legal review we may choose to take another course, although I do not expect that any change will be unfavorable to the community."

2014-07-06 14:10:18;On Stake - article by Vitalik Buterin on the Ethereum blog;"Another great article by Vitalik. There are clearly trade-offs between different algorithms.

I disagree with the statement that a  ""reason why it’s worth it to decentralize is to get the increased benefits of efficiency that decentralization brings"".

Is decentralisation really any more efficient than the equivalent centralised system? I'm not sure this is an obvious statement, centralisation tends to reduce the amount of work which has to be repeated and the amount of data which has to be replicated and stored.Great article, it is nice to have this review of PoS systems.

There is one thing I wanted to say about the ""nobility"" issue though. This is less of an issue for coins that are distributed through PoW mining.

There are no coins distributed in the genesis block, they are created progressively in later blocks. In Peercoin, the distribution does not stop, so there is a dilution of this ""nobility"" power, although the rate of dilution unfortunately slows down over time (growth of the money supply and decrease in the PoW rewards).

This means that, in case of a history revision attack, the attacker would have to remove all coins generated by PoW from existence since the forking point. This, in turn, means that the attacker has fewer coins at their disposal than the original blockchain.Thanks for this great article /u/vbuterin. I'd also like to know if you have any comments about the Proof-of-Stake Velocity (PoSV) algorithm (http://www.reddcoin.com/papers/PoSV.pdf) which has now entered public alpha testing. The chapter 2.3.2 in the white paper is of particular interest, since it touches upon some of the issues raised in your article.Isnt the amounts people have at any point a potential 'nobility'? Although presumably, it is the most concentrated at the genesis. What about 'constructing a history'? I.e. using transactions in the old chain to inflate our own stake.

The nonces make this much harder. AFAICS in a 'just send currency' cryptocurrency,(contracts make it more complicated..) you could pretend your public keys never sent anything, except for strategically, where the history where another account relied on money you sent them, but later sent you more.(you need the nonces inbetween)

On the other hand, if a transaction says ""i demand this prevhash"", or ""this hash ten blocks ago"", you can't construct a history at all.This is a useful review, but does not yet capture the whole argument.  Two important aspects are missing:

* PoS can never be more decentralized than the cost of rounding up primary stakeholders in person.

* Humans spend lots of energy generating heat, around the world.  Sometimes heat is not waste."

Think of a reason why you want to buy ether. Perhaps you want to create contracts and you'll need ether for that... perhaps you want to use certain contracts and you'll need ether for that. Since the Ethereum 1.0 blockchain has not been started yet, I doubt you can make such a judgement, so my advice is to wait.

There is no limited supply of ether for the initial sale. That means there won't be a bidding war and there is no way to make a profit until the sale is over, at which time most people that want ether, probably already bought them.

Honestly, the only way I can see this is going is a massive drop in price over the months after the sale, until the official release. At that time, the price may spike, but not nearly enough to support actual usage.

The actual value  of ether will only become clear over the next few years if and when people actually start using it.There is no way to ""invest"" in Ethereum.  Ethereum is an open source software project, a distributed application platform and a non-profit foundation.  You can purchase a product -- ether -- to enable you to build dapps, to pay for services on the platform, or even to buy different tokens that might be created by third parties on the platform for various uses.  

Or if you want, you can buy ether to support development of the platform because you believe in the project."
2014-07-16 12:55:21;Setting the presale price vs mining cost estimates?;"It's not possible; if we set the price to 2X instead of X then the quantity will be Q/2 instead of Q, so the issuance per year will be 0.15Q instead of 0.3Q, so the mining cost per unit will be 2M instead of M. If we set the issuance per year to be something other than 0.3/year, then the mining cost will still tend toward equilibrium with unit price.Things haven't progressed to the point where your question could be answered.The presale ""price"" is irrelevant, because the price is fixed but the market will decide on the total amount of tokens. 

The cost of mining is usually believed to follow the expected return for miners, so the amount of miners who will dedicate hardware to ethereum will vary according to the market's expectation of how much it will be valuable.

So both variables, the total amount of issued ether and the total amount of mining power comes from the market value of ethereum, it's not set by developers."

2014-07-24 23:27:08;how does maid safe storage [drop box style] system differ from the etherium storage system?;"It is hard to say because both systems are in pre-alpha and there is still a bit of 'hand waving' going on but what I've been able to gather via cursory analysis:

The MaidSafe system is entirely focused on solving the problem of distributed bandwidth/storage allocation.

Ethereum is a more general distributed *computation* system.

This means that the MaidSafe system is likely to be more efficient but Ethereum is going to be more flexible.

In other words, if your one and only problem is to backup data as cheaply as possible, the MaidSafe system is likely to be a cheaper solution.

However if you want to do anything more interesting (like setup your own intricate rules on who can read the data under what conditions including bizarre ones like ""only release upon the death of Abe Vigoda"") then the ethereum system will be the one to choose.

In fact, it's reasonable that if MaidSafe turns out to work well, that people would use Ethereum to setup the complex rules and MaidSafe to serve up the data.

IMHO Ethereum is best thought of as a CPU, and CPUs tend to rely on other subsystems for things like bulk data storage. I can see the two working together quite happily.Another great storage project is storj. They are also doing a crowd sake right now: storj.io/crowdsale.htmlIn Ethereum data is stored within the blockchain itself. It is not designed to store very large amounts of data, and storage is therefore more expensive.
In MaidSafe storage is separate from the currency (SafeCoin) and its blockchain."
2014-07-24 22:11:02;Processing speed contract/dapps;"I read somewhere a recommendation that you should view the processing power comparable to a 1999 mobile phone.

Even though the language is Turing complete, the strength of it is not to do number crunching.

I think the idea is that every miner will execute the same code, to verify correctness. That is why computing power is expensive. Until the proof of work algorithm is complete I don't think we will know the true speed.

I think currently the work done on the 'proof of work' is independant of the work done when executing the contracts. I know there has been talk and interest in linking the two but so far I don't believe that is the case (is that still true?).

If the proof of work remains *independent* from the work of processing the transactions, then there is effectively no limit on the rate of 'CPU horsepower' that can be devoted to executing contracts.

In addition, I'm sure the vast majority of the contracts will be executable concurrently, though it wouldn't surprise me to learn that the current implementation is single threaded to keep things simple during the alpha."

The argument I got was: ""You want to make the data in this contract available to other contracts and provide an interface for that.""IIUC, the external world can query contract storage offline. However, if you add a query function, another contract can call your query function. 

Example: you have a SchellingCoin contract that tracks what the current USDETH price is. If I want to write a contract that wants to send 5 USD worth of ETH somewhere, I can do that by calling the USDETH contract to get the current price."

There are a lot of like minded people there and its a good chance to see how other projects are starting to move off the ground.

I think the ideas are great! There is a definite place for Ethereum contracts in the private transportation. Perhaps you could factor in other aspects such as parcel delivery; that way journeys could even be subsidized if the driver has to travel a little further to deliver a parcel and person in the same journey. Would save a lot on petroleum costs, the driver earns more from doing two jobs at once, the passenger benefits from a cheaper fair and the parcel recipient will probably end up paying less as well. Talk about efficient!

In regards to Fantasy Football, that shit is massive dude crack. With Ethereum allowing multiple users to take part in a contract, I can totally see this being a thing. Everyone could put £5 in at the beginning, then payments would be based on results which could be automatically pulled off a website. Hell you could even have a matchmaking algorithm which takes into account past users success or failure so they are more fairly sorted with equally knowledgeable users.

2014-07-31 19:43:15;Executing contracts / Ether volitility;"> There are set fees to run computational steps.

Fees are not fixed. The sender specifies their own `GASPRICE`: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper#messages-and-transactions

The *ratio of fees* between classes of operations is fixed and all of these can be scaled by `GASPRICE`.

> Developers that create services/DAOs, will base their fees in Ether. 

That's certainly the simplest and most natural. It's quite possible, however, to base fees on some other indexing contract.

Suppose there's a well-regarded contract which returns an exponential moving average drawn from multiple exchanges for the price of ether in USD. In that case it is not hard at all to specify new contracts which query that index to determine their fees.

If we further suppose that miner's marginal costs are primarily pegged to USD, then perhaps they will *also* rely on such a contract to set their minimum accepted `GASPRICE`. If they don't do that, they are taking on the volatility of ETH.They might use a datafeed of some kind to estimate the ether price and possibly compensate. Could also just take price variations as par for the course of course. [Here is a thread about it](forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/5412/)

As for the gas price, what /u/crypto-tim said. `GASPRICE` must be variable one way or another. One way it to have people making transactions set it for themselves and having a gas limit. I think then maybe it might be useful to have a way to regulate the gas limit. Although it'd have be be something like stakeholders doing that. We want it to stay decentralized, which requires it not to be too hard to run a full node.Sub-currencies whose value are tied to particular services will have to be created, and then also smart contracts for hedging can be created. A bit of a plug for BitShares: BTSX deals with ""trustless"" price pegging (start flame war now), and with DPOS you can have a very reliable M-of-N feed coming from block producers who also run ethereum client."
2014-07-31 18:21:55;Too much inflation..;"2% currency supply increase per year is very reasonable; with the world GDP growing by 2-4% per year that would balance out on net to give you either perfect stability or very slight price deflation, which quite a few people  particularly in the Chicago school think is optimal (and also, our supply increase rate keeps going down over time so after 100 years it will be under 1%). QE is actually increasing the money supply at a much faster rate than that (either 5% per year or 50% per year depending on which measure of money supply you take).Well at least you know what it is going to be, (1.198X initially, 0.26X issued per year) and at least people cant give the issuance to themselves. I dont think it is at all a problem, Ether has plenty of room to grow to match/exceed the issuance.

A  couple of decades in the future seems far to look ahead. Maybe well have a [burn-over](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Burn#Coin-burning_as_a_tool_for_transition_between_cryptocurrencies) by then or something. That is basically an option from Ethereum2.0.I think currencies that have a permanent and constant inflation built in are stupid.  Inflation is not necessary just because someone thinks it is.  Any increase in the monetary pool should be proportional to some kind of increase in value represented by that money.

Deflation is better than inflation, and no inflation / deflation is best.  I have yet to see a system that appropriately addresses the inflation deflation problem including bitcoin.  Ethereum would have been perfect -as it solves so many other problems - if it simply floated its monetary base in the same way it proposes to do other things... A decentralized self executing logic based increase and decrease based on value tied to the system.  

Perhaps someone with a slightly better understanding of math and economics could write a method for doing this.  As the rest of the system is based on decentralization and auto execution, there is no good reason that this fundamental element of ethereum should not be treated the same.  Yep. Ether won't hit inflation rates comparable to the dollar until year 45.

2014-08-07 09:43:47;Any value in implementing Ethereum in F#?;"I think Etherum (or any crypto for that matter) will benefit a lot from being implemented on top a clean, modern language.

Go is OK, C++ should be ditched IMO.
F# (or C#) would be fantastic.c++, Go, python are most complete. The Java version is almost fully compatible with poc5 and there is also a js version in the works. The more implementations, the better I'd say (doesn't even need to be a different language, although only do that if there are fundamental design conflicts between you and the original) 

As for getting another 'official' version, I think 2 was already plenty, but because of enthusiasm people just start building it in their language of choice. 

I don't think the DEV team wants to spend more money on alternative implementations at the moment though. Better finish the planned features in the already existing ones. 

So don't let anything stop you if you want to start and if your version becomes popular, good job. Having a functional language implementation would be a great aid in deriving some interesting Curry-Howard isomorphism goodness. This would mostly be useful with provable security related tasks. 

.Net is a bit restrictive and if one wanted to venture down that road, I believe it would be better to adopt a JVM based functional language like Clojure. I think someone is doing a pedagogical implementation of Ethereum in Haskell, which I may participate in after I finish my Udemy course. Yes. Contracts written in functional languages would be much easier to ""read"" for humans than contracts in imperative languages.

Clear understanding of what a contract does is vital for its popularity. For example, one could write a very sophisticated contract that does a cool thing, but if noone is able to verify this then it will likely not be used at all."

I think taxing can be *fine*, and basically you should support those if the tax goes to the actual developers *and* is reasonable. I dont think 1% forever is fine, basically you'd go 1% upto some large amount of ethers,(*some* amount is *plenty*, though it is not super-easy to estimate because you dont know how much the ethers will be worth) and after that, and shift in 'tax' goes to servicers of the system.(which could be the developers.)

We dont at all need 'shareholders'. I am fine with them if they 'speculate' on future tax, and give the developers money during development rather than after launch. But i dont feel fine with perpetual power of shareholders over the DAO, i would find that *much* worse than perpetual tax.. I would prefer it shift over time to users and servicers of the DAO.

Looks to be fairly easy to get that, assuming you can get users behind you, just demand it and switch to forks if it doesnt. Hell, if you think they tax too much or give shareholders too much power you can fork it and *still* give the rewards to original developers. You dont need to hurt them much to do it.

Edit: How we make social norms on this we can reasonably agree on? For instance lets say an investor invests in something with 1% chance of success. 100× payout would 'break even', ignoring opertunity costs, and nonlinearity of the amount you get. So for instance 1000× payout might be an acceptable maximum. So for instance 2000× payout could be a really conservative maximum.

'Power over' the DAO is trickier.. Because it is . The shareholders possibly might need to be able to protect the taxing functionality, on the other hand, the community could possibly fork anyway, so maybe they should trust the community.(as a whole, because any involved changes would require a lot of stakeholders)"

Looks like someone doesn't know the meaning of 'unique'.
You'd get æther for free whether you buy ether or not.

So it's a false dichotomy.

But if you buy ether you also get to invest in the dev team that created the codebase of ether __and__ æther.The æthereum concept is flawed. Ethereum requires that the crypto currency start with some actual real world value. Since Ethereum will contain a turing complete language in the block chain, it means anyone can create an endless loop, causing all other computation on the chain to halt. With Ethereum, each ether will have cost about $0.25, so running an endless loop is cost prohibitive. (Running any code on the block chain requires sending that code ether in order to execute. The cost is based on the number of steps you want to execute in the code.)

With æthereum, since I can collect æther for free, then I have nothing to lose by not abusing the block chain with pointless calculations and loop bombs. æthereum will be dead before it can even start.What is to stop someone from setting up a thousand different addresses, and shifting BTC from one to the next and subsequently using the BTC over and over in different addresses to sign and drawl AETHER.  Whats the key combo?That's exactly why I didn't invest in ethereum. And this is just the start. Side-chains will be the nail in the coffin.This thread is epic, but will likely be downvoted into oblivion, thanks for bringing this up."

2014-08-13 16:48:16;What's with the hate from /r/Bitcoin? Seriously?;"There's lots of money slushing around various cryptocurrency projects (ethereum being one of them) and people on r/bitcoin are alarmed by this in general and are very much on their guard to sidestep any potential scams. This seems to me like pretty reasonable cautiousness (ethereum is still very much unproven, after all.)

Additionally, ethereum is sidestepping some of the established approaches taken by other successful currencies, such as being fully volunteer-developed (like bitcoin/namecoin/litecoin.) I think a good case can be made for ethereum having its premine to help fund development, but it's definitely a bit of a shortcut to try to develop a currency like this without having it arise organically within a volunteer community...

Personally though, I don't want to wait a few additional years for a volunteer community to build ether-style functionality if some prudent, targeted funding can help the project reach completion a bit faster.Just wait until some project in competition with Ethereum emerges. You will see the same sort of nonsense here, I promise you.I invested in both, replaced my bitcoins with new. I see ethereum as the underdog and my investment as a hedge that my bitcoin won't lose their value. 

There is a lot of scepticism which I think is reasonable, a lot of money has been invested by the community with very little guarantees. And people tend to be aggro against new ideas... Like libertarians were vocal against Bitcoin so are bitcoiners vocal against Ethereum. Just let the vocal be vocal, if the system works it won't matter what they think or they will change their minds in time. People feel what they don't understand, and hate when they don't understand how to express their opinions.These haters are just heavily invested in scamcoins and fear new and better competition. The Ethereum community only should focus in one thing: **BUILD AWESOME STUFF**.. the mouths will close as we keep moving the project forward.haters gonna hate. http://www.quickmeme.com/img/09/0999958bf0d611c0c126c24cb234316d90c3b25fb39e8395e67ecb1ebaead860.jpgI am not a fan of the /r/bitcoin community. They appear to have this extreme, almost religious belief in the success of Bitcoin, and will vehemently downvote anything they feel is a threat to Bitcoin, or the price of bitcoins. This includes bad news, any kind of regulation, and alternative currencies.

If you look at the community, there's a lot of hate around it. There's hate for the government, hate for those that sell, hate for those that scammed them (although surprisingly little hate for those that scammed other people), hate for the news outlets... etc. It's not that surprising that they've also got a bit of hate left in them for other digital cryptocurrencies. I'd imagine the more innovative and successful another cryptocurrency is, the more they hate it. Because any advance in technology could challenge their hopeful 100,000$ bitcoin future, so I imagine we'll be seeing a lot of hate from /r/bitcoin.

Much as been made about how blockchain tech has - and will - revolutionize the financial world. But in various corners of the crypto world, developers and thinkers are also contemplating how this technology will change the simple act of voting.

Ethereum, with its open-source smart contracts, is particularly well-suited for decentralized voting. Concerns over lack of transparency and vote-rigging evaporate when there's an easy way to verify that everything is legitimate and above-the-board.

Enter DOUG and Eris

A group called Project Douglas is spearheading decentralized voting in Ethereum. DOUG is a framework for building Decentralized Organizations (DO) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), while Eris is their ""...serverless consensus building and community governance platform.""

We'll take a closer look at these projects, dig into the evolving-before-our-very-eyes concept of a DAO, and also delve into some of the deeper political and social implications of decentralized voting.

Hanging out:

What are you working on in the Ethereum space? What questions do you have? What would you like to learn? We've built in plenty of time after the featured discussion to share, network, chat, and chill.

About the venue:

Our home for Ethereum Denver is the Sidewinder Tavern - a kickass venue that's centrally located in Denver at I-25/I-70 and also convenient for anyone making their way down from Boulder.

Schedule for the night:

7:00-7:30: Welcome + Order Up Food and Drink

7:30-8:15: DOUG, Eris, and DAO's

8:15-Whenever: hang out, summon cthulu, etc.

2014-08-28 14:54:32;A solution for student loans! By investing in Student's future! Each student becomes a commodity by issuing their coin!;"Just what a student needs... more liabilities 

Or are these coins not redeemable for anything?This could be generalized to anyone by the issuance of personal coins. Right now the debs have jokingly created JeffCoin and GavCoin as a test but this cold actually be very useful if we back them by personal time.

Anyone in ethereum can issue a personal HourCoin, a uncapped, centrally issued coin where the issuer promises to make one hour of his time available to anyone who gives him one. This can be used as a simple trade of favors (""thanks for spending one hour fixing my computer, here, have one hour of my time redeemable in the future"") but can also be used to invest in someones else future (""I really like your art, here let me give you some money with the only promise that one day you'll work a full day doing something for me"").

Backers can emit any quantity of coins they like, but anyone would be able to check those and see if he can reasonably make due with all his compromises. Professional traders would be basically talent scouts, measuring how good someone is, and investors could buy a whole class today and in the future they would probably have a healthy mix of hours worth anything from free intern work to a valuable hour with a CEO...This is really a legal contract though.  I'm not sure how Ethereum can enforce anything ... Ethereum contracts are only enforceable,  if, and only if, both parties put down collateral. I don't think most students can put up a $50,000 (or more) collateral in to the Ethereum contract up-front. (Before getting the loan/equity)

So no, Ethereum network cannot solve this problem.  Traditional lawyers will be better in this case. 

The idea itself is an interesting and a novel one. Buying equity or hours in students :)

-TechnologovI think people are missing the obvious here. The coin could be worth a percentage of income. So say I issue a coin that represents 100% of all future income and I sell off 5%. I could have a contract set up which an employer would send earnings to and it would automatically split the income, sending it to the owners of the coin accordingly.

2) Mining algorithms are being developed with the intent of allowing home pcs to be able to mine. The total mined per year will be no more than 15.6 million ethers every year.First the price will drop very sharply and will continue to drop over time because of the nearly 40% of total pre-mine. Look at the price history of every other pre-mined coin and notice they all follow this trend.

Miners won't mine because the price continually is dropping making it a bad investment of their resources. If they do mine they will immediately dump the coin to avoid the extreme risk.

The network will have limited processing power because few people want to mine. As a result of this the network will be slow and weak making people unlikely to buy ETH as a way to run their programs. Miners that held instead of selling will leave the business because they got burned.

It's almost as if it were created with the intention of making a negative price feedback loop rather than a positive one. 

If I'm wrong please enlighten me. I'm totally open to someone explaining why ETH will be valuable if you can refute these ideas. The average purchase price of ether while accounting for the Endowments is $0.214 at the current coinbase spot of $489.17.

Storj.io will do it  and they were planning on Ethereum integration.Storj is working great! Try it out at http://node1.metadisk.org/ :)

ethereum doesn't inherently do decentralized storage. but since it does do decentralized compute, you can use it to organize decentralized storage, in whatever way you chose. the stored data would not go on the blockchain, but it would be tracked by it, and compensation would be awarded according to it.Maidsafe is a fantastic technology, but I didn't invest for two reasons.  Firstly they never really gave a good explanation on how Safecoin would be used, it seemed like they were just jumping on the blockchain bandwagon.  Secondly, there's 4.3 billion coins (as far as I remember) and only 10% are available right now.  Do your research on the market cap and coin release schedule.

I think the market cap of Storj is about 1/10 of Maidsafe right now, it's probably worth considering if you're into decentralized storage.I think maidsafe includes storage but is mostly built around computing?  Storj maybe?  Ethereum is a programmable blockchain

Oh dear god.  Prices matter - but usually less than your bottom line.  If you're more worried about the price of your stock than your customers/product/employees you kill the goose who lays the golden egg.  It's about priorities - ethereum should focus on the goose.  Which is implementing the smartchain concept in a sustainable way.  That's it - they don't need to worry about price.  Price is (supposed) to be a reflection not a goal in and of itself.  *grumbles* Why didn't u buy more doge?Not sure what mention of prices not mattering you are referencing.

The presale price can be multiplied by any number and it wouldnt matter. This is because the amount bought sets the supply. People have their expectations of a market cap and buy if they think their fraction will be worth more at launch. Multiply the price by any factor, and the fractions wont change.

So that is an counter example to the idea that price always matters. Probably the reason is that there no real cost in creating an ether,(though there is a cost to creating Ethereum)  well, it is just limited by the possibility of integer overflow, but 2^256 wei ≈ 1.16⋅10^77 wei = 1.16⋅10^59 ether.

We don't expect you guys to manipulate the price to please us, but we do expect you to fight tooth and nail to conquer the world with your idea (because let's be honest and reasonable, if you conquer the world with your idea the ether will be much much much more valuable than it is today). We DON'T expect to hear from you guys in about 4 weeks that you just gave all up because since you only care about the technology you found another place and another arrangement where you can better pursue your love for tech and anyway Ethereum was just a direction, a dirty business plan which you loathe because you guys are only in love with the abstract essence of pure unadulterated tech.

This is not main Ethereum per se but the [Whisper protocol](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2fzj3p/whisper_messaging_signalling_publication/). It's not yet done and there are many open questions


> How can I know, that contract does what it proclaims to do?

A contract should publish it's source code somewhere and what compiler it's using and that code can be compiled and should be identical to the hash of the current byte code. A decentralized reputation contract will be developed to keep track of those hashes and communicate to the user clearly what is known and what's unknown about that contract so the user can make an informed decision about his risks. That reputation contract can be replaced by any other the user wishes.

When full-nodes mine the Ether, which node gets the Gas? I know that they don't get it directly, but network should give it to them. But to who? To first node which sends the correct solution? To random node?

I believe this works in a very similar to transaction fees in bitcoin but  I'll let this one for the other more technical minded devs to answer ;-) 




Not exactly sure, but FWIW:

> I've read that there is possibility to send messages. How big? Is there transaction fee, or messages are free?

You can implement a messaging system using contracts, but probably you are talking about 'Whisper' a proposed protocol extension to send messages.

It is at this moment unclear to me how it is supposed to work, there is some information on a wiki page here https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/Whisper see this forum thread where people are asking for info https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/6117

> How can I know, that contract does what it proclaims to do?

Indeed you are only seeing the bytecode and it could even be obfuscated. So you don't know for sure what the contract will do.

You can simulate what a transaction does though before sending it, but if the contract doesn't immediately respond and only updates internal storage, then this might be of limited use.

> When full-nodes mine the Ether, which node gets the Gas?

When you are mining a block you set the ""coinbase"" to your own address. Once mined (valid nonce/PoW found), the network considers this the latest block and your address will be updated with the ether as a result of this.

I know that uncle blocks (stale blocks, valid PoW but mined too late) are also included, not exactly sure how rewards work for that.

It's an intelligent discussion between an informed presenter and an engaged audience, with a perspective that's a little different from our usual fare here. If anyone's on the fence about watching it, they should!is that Richard Stallman asking the first question?So the interface between the law, rules etc are people enforcing them (train conductors, police officers, etc). I can get very upset when they behave like robots: not every situation applies to your preprogrammed rules.

With contracts running on Ethereum there is actually no way around this, either it was programmed into the contract before or too bad. I think this is something to consider and I think this lecture raises some important points.

Curious on your thoughts

The nice part of Ethereum platform is that people in general will have the choice to create their own laws (Smart laws) without influences from current legal system around the world. However its possible that some DAO may create oppressive kind of smart contracts (smart bugs) but since code will remain open (thanks for Richard Stallman) and the oppressive legal bugs could be fixed through smart contracts. Many laws nowadays violate many Constitutions and common people don't understand that.The developers will have the choice to create alternative smart contracts (smart laws) which will create new type of society and hopefully bring some good for common people. The current legal systems are only benefiting few and creates extreme modern slavery and inequality. ﻿I don't think there was one person in this video that fully comprehends Ethereum.  Most were stuck on the term contract in a very literal sense, thinking that Ethereum will just code legal contracts between people on a blockchain.  Even the concept of smart property seemed to be quite misunderstood. (lol. Kinda funny when the guy spoke about ripping out the computer from the car).  Even the presenter seemed to only think of Ethereum in a very confined political sense. If you applied her same takeaway of Ethereum to other ""new technologies"" in the past, you could very easily hear her making the statement ""this new invention the automobile could have very bad consequences for law-enforcement because criminals will use them to quickly leave the scene of a crime and that could be scary a thing about automobiles. We'll have to see what happens"".  

I'm feeling very conflicted after watching this video.  On one hand I'm a little miffed that people don't just ""get it"" with Ethereum.  But on the other hand I'm very glad that no only do I ""get it"", I really ""get it"".  I certainly plan to put my understanding of Ethereum to action."

* Mining. Ethereum will have a short block time, rewards for uncles and if needed a trust less mining pool contracts, meaning that instead of having rare large rewards the rewards will be constant and tiny. This means that if the network isn't flooded by super uber miners, if your computer is decent and if you wait long enough then you might be able to get a few cents in a few minutes. This should be enough for paying most contracts.

* Buying. The client will feature many decentralized exchanges, so if you have any kind of crypto currency you'll be able to trade for ethers even in small quantities. Also, if big ether companies are in the beginning selling Ether by other means, then the client will feature them also.

* Earning. Every time you see a site, google pays the site owner 1-2 tenths of a cent. You can use amazon turk to draw a sheep and earn 0.5 cents. Someone might run a faucet that just drops money as a promotion. Many companies might create business models that distribute ether in exchange for views, audience or small work. The Ethereum foundation won't be paying you for these things and does not control what you do, but they can and should control what you see the first time you open the app, and provide easy links to reputable and non scammy third party services.

The main point is that most contracts will be very very cheap, and that it should be easy to earn a low amount of money.

2014-09-11 07:14:04;"I have a question about ""Merkle trees"" chapter in the white paper.";"The sentence you're referring to highlights the fact that this data structure is fundamental to the stability of Bitcoin, and thus an important part of Ethereum too. The rest of the paragraph explains the technicalities of how the structure works and why it is good for the security and stability of the system.the multi-level data structure works as follows

1. block hash is over the header data
2. header data contains transactionRoot (hash over all transactions) and over stateRoot (hash calculated over the state of all accounts in the system - using a data structure called the ""Modified Merkle Patricia Trie"")
3. Each account contains a storageRoot (hash calculated over a key/value store associated with this account, again using the same *Trie* data structure)

As you can hopefully see, the top block hash would be a result of a multi-staged calculation over the data in the system at that point in time.

So the levels are:

- block
- state (all accounts)
- storage (each account)You're doing a great job so far ryoumh!"

2014-09-18 19:16:07;ethereum blog | Scalability, Part 1: Building on Top;"The off-chain transactions and the audited oracle are very interesting!

Can't some of these off chain transactions be done by side chains of ethereum forks?

If we split the ethereum network in two separate networks, then we would have more efficiency in executing the contracts, since fewer nodes were doing each computation, and each network could probably read from the other directly and send transactions to the other as an external contract, like two complementary alt-coins (side chains?). This of course would come at the cost of security since now each one has half the power, but there is probably a diminishing return on investment in security, that once a network is big enough adding more power won't make it that much more safer. Also, there are certain kinds of computations that probably require less security than others, probably because they hold fewer valuable assets. Making separate networks also helps with connectivity, a highly interconnected city with one slow internal link could quickly reach consensus among itself for transactions that only happened internally and then, like a fractal, try to reach a larger and larger consensus.

So could there be a way to programatically split the ethereum network as it grows into multiple smaller alt-chains that could talk to themselves?
I'm not sure I understand this all correctly - In the batching example it talks about using one signature to send multiple transactions using a contract splitter to avoid bloat on the blockchain.. Does that mean contracts don't sign their transactions like ethereum accounts do?How much is an auditing transaction?  Who/what sets the price?"

The major thing to remember about Ethereum vs other crowd sales is this; It will have use completely outside of being a coin, which will give the coin value. Also it already has a large network of users (although they are really more enthusiasts at this point) and investors. It's entirely supply and demand, so it's a tough guess at this stage.[deleted]My gut tells me to look for it to reach 0.0008BTC, or higher, while people who sat out the pre-sale try to acquire some ETH. Then dropping back below 0.0005. Other models I have that go against my gut but make sense on paper give a little higher price before the drop, as high as 0.005BTC. This is taking into account the presale demand and extending that enthusiasm till after launch. BUT you can only guess at this point. I bought in because I like the Idea, not really speculating on price, but the trader in me demands I at least do a few calculations on predicting the future. I would say if your speculating you're likely to get burned unless your holding for a bit. Well, it will start at or near the last genesis sale price. Then, who knows, but lest I repeat myself, [here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereummarkets/comments/2bqkxv/anybody_alive_here_heres_my_take/).Depends on the where the other cc's are. If bitcoin is $300 when it launches, it might see a decline. If bitcoin is back up to 1000 or more, people will probably flood in to the launch. I think certainly in the first 24 hours we'll see a price spikeThis is question no. two. but the first question is how will you sell your ETH and convert it into BTC regardless of value it attains.

I think what will happen is the gravitation towards what is already happening in the VC industry with things like Angellist syndicates. If there is going to plenty opportunties to crowdfund, I'd delegate some funds to a person who has time and know-how in an industry and they will invest for me.

So, I reckon the money will still be there, and will pour into businesses, it will just equalise it a bit more.what about decentralized autonomous angel investobots!..To the extent that capital will become more fluidly available, yes.

But there will never be a substitute for hard-won expertise that advisors provide. Knowledge like that helps in recruiting, credibility, etc. The very nature of startups are new ideas that, by definition, are novel & manual (at least at first). If we can successfully simulate human creativity with some future AI then, I'd say we'll be artists, enslaved, or extinct very quickly thereafter.

Blockchain tech will power the platforms, not supplant them.

To directly answer the question: VCs will very likely co-opt said platform for their own benefit, much like savvy governments are realizing that Bitcoin could be more of a friend than an enemy (public ledger)."
2014-10-01 11:04:57;This company launched a year ago trading IP licensing rights... A perfect target for an Ethereum application?;"Here is an article by the economist on it:

>THE technology industry is at war over intellectual property. On May 7th the first round of a three-part fight between Oracle and Google over patent and copyright claims relating to the Java programming language ended in a decision that denied outright victory to either firm. Apple, Samsung and others are fighting over smartphone patents. Facebook and Yahoo! are at loggerheads over internet patents. Accusations abound that innovation is taking a back seat to litigation. Only the lawyers are smiling.

>All of which makes this a good time to launch a new approach to trading intellectual property, says Gerard Pannekoek, the boss of IPXI, a new financial exchange that lets companies buy, sell and hedge patent rights, just like any other asset. The idea is to offer a patent or group of patents as “unit licence rights” (ULRs), which can be bought and sold like shares. A ULR grants a one-time right to use a particular technology in a single product: a new type of airbag sensor in a car, say. If a company wants to use the technology in 100,000 cars, it buys 100,000 ULRs at the market price. ULRs are also expected to be traded on secondary markets.

>This is simpler, faster and cheaper than the lawyer-intensive process of negotiating bilateral licences for intellectual property, the high cost of which discriminates against small companies, leaves patents unused on the shelf and hampers innovation. IPXI's approach does not work for all types of intellectual property—it does not allow exclusive licensing, for example—but should make it easier for companies to make money from their inventions. “It's a great form of non-dilutive funding for start-ups,” suggests Mr Pannekoek.

>The exchange has signed up 30 members including Philips, an electronics giant, and several universities and research laboratories. IPXI was set up in 2008 by Ocean Tomo, a merchant bank that specialises in intellectual property, and its investors include CBOE Holdings, the parent company of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. On May 4th IPXI published the rulebook that governs how the exchange will work, and it expects to open for business later this year. Its novel approach is ideal for the open, non-exclusive licensing of smartphone-related patents, says Ruud Peters, chief intellectual-property officer at Philips. Good news for innovators, perhaps, but bad news for lawyers?

They even call the assets they are trading **ULR contracts**"
2014-10-01 09:19:56;No profit in contract fees?;"I totally agree with you that network effect will play a very large role in this along with the service's reputation within the user community (whether the contract has been audited so people know it does what it is expected etc).

I think some elements can still be monetised, though to do so may require some amount of centralisation and off chain computation.

Slightly contorting an [example](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bjmgb/hi_we_are_the_ethereum_project_team_ask_us/cj607qs) Vitalik has used in the past, you would see a contract that acts as an efficiency booster, making a small profit every time an entity runs it's algorithm. 

So you could have a equation that takes into account packages that need to be delivered in a local area and match that with an Uber-like service for picking up passengers. People would picked up along with packages that are going in a similar direction, and the person/package would each pay slightly less fare on their journey as one is subsidised by the other (neat right!).

This algorithm will need to interface with oracles off-chain to gather the data needed to work out the route, so why can't the algorithm itself also exist off chain? 

If that is the case, then it does not have to be by default open source and the contract can continue to make money for its use until someone can come up with a better more efficient algorithm with another contract.

Now, that example is not how I'd necessarily want to see Ethereum used. I'd rather see entities follow the likes of Redhat's business philosophy - if something is open source it can still be monetised as long as you are able to add additional useful services (support/training/consulting) on top to justify expenditure.

Regardless, it will be interesting to see how people approach this in the future.


This forces people to make money on a

* *""provide actual service""*-model

* *""write once and cash forever""*-modelYes this is an area that will have to be defined.

good thing there's no such thing as ""economics""

so no, its not impossible. like you said, network effect is huge. people still pay itunes for music they can get for free.No one was sure how to monetize the web when it was invented either but look at it now. I think there are probably a lot of great ways to monetize and keeping transparency high and driving down costs for users is awesome. I know it doesn't apply to every application but I think issuing some type of premined sub currency as a sort of reward program is a cool idea."
2014-10-01 02:58:43;Ethereum Denver - October 7th - Get Started & Connect With Cryptoheads;"With each passing month, we're closer to the launch of the Ethereum - currently expected around March 2015. In the meantime, the ongoing development of proof of concept (POC) code and a highly usable testnet means that developers and entrepreneurs can already sink their teeth into the platform.

Getting Started

When it comes to building your own decentralized app (Dapp) or getting started with Ethereum, who better to ask than developers who are already working with the platform?

You'll hear from meetup members on their own experiences, and gain insights into how you can dive into the protocol. 

Not a dev?

If you're more business-minded but still want a better understanding of how Ethereum works behind the scenes, this session is also for you. We'll touch on ways that you, as an entrepreneur, can connect with developers who can help you turn your ideas into hard-coded reality.

Denver Bitcoin Center

Ben - you might know him as the organizer of the excellent Bitcoin meetup in Denver - will also be on hand to talk about a very badass concept: the Denver Bitcoin Center aims to create a shared workspace where cryptoheads of all stripes can collaborate and create.

Hanging out:

What are you working on in the Ethereum space? What questions do you have? What would you like to learn? We've built in plenty of time after the featured discussion to share, network, chat, and chill.

About the venue:

Our home for Ethereum Denver is the Sidewinder Tavern, centrally located in Denver at I-25/I-70 and convenient for anyone making their way down from Boulder.

Schedule for the night:

7:00-7:30: Welcome + Order Up!

7:30-8:15: Get Started and Build Your Own Dapp

8:15-8:30: Denver Bitcoin Center

8:30-whenever: hang out, discuss how the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire, etc.  
Any questions? Want to share or present something at the meetup? Drop me a line!

2014-09-30 19:59:27;Ethereum missed this opportunity by being late to the party;"Not necessarily too late. I don't think Reddit has decided at this point how their currency would workLate? It's a great opportunity for them to build something together with us. I think it is too late.  Reddit, most likely, will go with a more seasoned approach.  Ethereum, hasn't been put to the test in production, while Bitcoin ahas been tested for over 5 years now.  I can see Reddit using a technology built on top of Bitcoin like Colored Coins or CounterParty. I just don't see it happening with Reddit and Ethereum.

I wish Etherreum had launched a MVP product instead of taking over a year to launch.  By waiting, they take a significant chance of being too late to the part when Ethereum launches.  I'm not saying that's going to happen. I'm just saying, it's a large calculated risk by the Ethereum dev team.  One that may not have needed to be made.

What about (subjective)reputation. It seems to be a complex thing. But in some cases when you allow someone else to wash your car, you rely on reputation.(at least partly) I kindah expect that instead of trying to get a data feed about cars being washed, the 'car washing contract' allows people to accept the job, *if* they have enough (implied)reputation from the car owner. The stake for the washer would be his reputation. The 'car washing contract' never really needs to know about whether the car was washed, if the reputation system is actually sufficient. 

Note that the deal can be moved risk-wise by requiring a deposit for parties. If neither can access the deposit, only release to the other, it is sort-of 'grudge based'.(it is irrational in terms of optimising your own wealth) But taking the deposit could also automatically imply things for the reputation system, i.e. if the washer puts in a deposit, washes, and the car owner takes the deposit. Perhaps the contract could be such that the washer could 1) acknowledge, for instance if (s)he actually did damage 2) protest.(or it could be a spectrum between the two) (1) would basically be an agreement between owner and washer, implying no reputation damage for the owner, and limiting it to that of the washer. (2) is complete disagreement, and reputation damage is done to both.

Of course, other car washers and owners might take note of the disagreement, they do not want to lose respectively customers or people to wash their cars, when the disagreement could just have been car owners selfishly taking deposits, or washers not acknowledging (accidental)damage. I.e. having more customers/washers in the system is better for their utility, and maximizing that means removing the culprits, not the victims.(though it is a bit of a public resource)"

2014-10-16 15:24:30;http://bliive.com/ seems like an awesome example of a service _made_ for etherum;"Here's an interesting side effect of a time share crypto currency: it could change student loans.

See, in order for time based currencies to work, you need trust. You wouldn't accept 3000 hours of hours from a guy in the other side of the world who claims he earn all that by working 24h everyday. If his hours were as valid as anyone's else, then the inflation would destroy the currency.

So what you do is, you have personal hours. I give you my hour to you and I accept yours. Trading can be automated in a way similar to ripple: I'm willing to accept a maximum X amount of hours from my brother, N amount from my dentist. Some locations and professional centres can act as brokers of hours. All hours from any dentist in Iowa can be traded for any other dentists. All hours from anyone in the Small Town are worth the same to anyone who lives in Small Town.

Which leads to investing in hours. Take a 100 students that have been accepted in a nice university. Buy a 100 hours from all, to be paid back in 10 years. Now you have a fund, with 10,000 hours worth of future doctors, CEO's and lawyers. Some people might never honor those hours, some people might drop out and become fast food workers, but at least some of these will become the kind of speaker or consultant that anyone would pay a lot of money to have an one hour chat or a dinner. 

Those future hours are valuable and can be speculated upon. Which means that buying those now, would make sense as they are cheaper. Which means that maybe, just maybe, you could pay for the education of all those 100 students.

2014-10-16 06:11:42;How businesses can utilize Ethereum to save money?;"Have you ever found yourself in the position where you have had to pay someone a fee simply because they are a trusted third-party? Or paid more for a good or service simply because you trusted the seller? Think about this hard, because you actually do it all the time - usually without even thinking about it. 

It used to be that if you wanted to know what the best product or service  to buy was, you would have to pay for a review of them all. Now you can just log onto any number of websites to see crowd sourced reviews of everything from books to hotels to movies. This saves you money as you avoid wasting it on inferior products.

It used to be that if you wanted to send money long distance, you would find a trusted business like western union to wire it and pay a hefty fee in the process. Now you can just use bitcoin.

Ethereum has the capability to vastly reduce the amount of money we spend 'trusting' one another in ways that no one has even come up with yet. That is how it will save your business money, and I'm sorry if that seems vague but this is still evolving and if I could predict the future I would have bought google stock in '05 and retired by now.

:)
Well it really depends on the business, but mostly I foresee ether being used to simplify systems and get rid of intermediaries. 

Bitcoin already does that in a way. The swift system that banks have been using for decades to settle debts and checks, is a very complex and costly system that requires lots of infrastructure. Bitcoin (and other similar technologies) does away with that and allows anyone to do it for a fraction of the cost. 

Cloud storage is a billion dollar industry that requires large data centers and other corporate costs, storj is intended to do away with that. 

Ethereum can do that o cloud computing. Or insurance industries, or the stock exchange, or money lending services etc: it cuts down costs by minimizing the needed infrastructure. With ethereum you could build a trusted  insurance sales company for the cost of building a lemonade stand, the biggest problem being just gaining the trust of consumers. 

Good if you want to be a small lemonade stand. Bad if you are a giant insurance company.

So you can 'lock' bitcoin, and then 'unlock' it in a 'side chain' and vica versa, because it can know when to unlock it.

It is basically the mechanism that [the last blog post suggests aswel](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/21/scalability-part-2-hypercubes/). But it adds a mechanism for contracts to do it aswel. Note that most of that blogpost is about getting the thing to actually be secure.

The sidechains paper talks about this in section 4. Miners merged-mine all, and full-node all, provide security to all of them, that is an advantage. Disadvantage, clear is that miner reward is *strongly superlinear* for miners that cannot afford full-noding everything. They mention mining pools. (""delegate validation and transaction selection"") IMO to get security, this would need to be researched more. Edit: ftr, to be clear, i think this seems insecure against centralization.

And you want mining not to be too superlinear, one way to do that is to allow merged-mining only up to some number of chains that is within reach for small enough miners such that there will be many of them. I.e. you can mention which chains you're mining next to the nonce, and your own address. (the address rewarded if you publish a block)

But that has the disadvantage that if an attacker wants to attack a sidechain, the act of putting more mining power on one, increases difficulty there, pushing other out, you really only need 30% of a single chain to capture one. I.e. the merged mining doesnt help the side chains that much.

Afaict, the approach in the Ethereum blogpost is to basically be able to tolerate that. It does so by having challenges that have to be answered with SPV proofs, that can turn out wrong in the main chain, disqualifying a block. This is basically the [hanging blocks idea](http://o-jasper.github.io/blog/2014/06/03/hanging_blocks.html), there but with cleverer way to present before/after state more flexibly using the Patricia tree. It also adds the idea of using them as challenges that if not answered at all, disadvantage the offending miner other substates because other substate clients wont accept the block, as long as they're seeing unsatisfied challenges around. (miners and users with full nodes on the substate wont accept it, period, because they demand entire blocks.) 

Afaik what that will look like on the network, and how to deal with potential spamming of challenges isnt entirely clear yet. Also, since an attacker pushes out other miners because he pushes difficulty on a substate up, i have to wonder, it will take longer to get an actual block winner, when an attacker is not responding to challenges. By alternating between releasing blocks, and not releasing, and not responding, perhaps an attacker can mess with the timing of blocks, slowing and speeding up. Not sure if that is important.

Btw: the Ethereum hyper cube thing, really it is just a graph of substate(our 'sidechain') tied to the main chain. The hyper cube is just a good way to make that graph work efficiently.In case anyone missed it, here's Vitalik writing about sidechains back in April: http://bitcoinmagazine.com/12349/side-chains-challenges-potential/

It'd be interesting to hear if his thoughts have changed at all.My own 2 mbits is that it will play out like a quote from Steve Jobs I heard as to why NeXT Computers failed... He said something like ""We built a computer that was 20% better but you can only sell a totally new platform if it's at least 100% better.""

I think that's what we're going to see with sidechains... sidechains are going to add some complexity/performance overhead (let's say 20%) and any altcoin that is only 20% better than bitcoin won't be able to attract users if they have a completely independent blockchain, in a world where Bitcoin sidechain support is available.

However, coins that are 100+% better by some metric (and IMHO ethereum falls into that camp) would actually be held back if they are burdened with the extra baggage of a sidechain system: This is because users won't mind going through the currency conversion hassle/risk if the benefits are great enough. Hence, it would be suboptimal for coins like ethereum that offer substantial innovation to pay the ""sidechain tax"".

But those are just guesses... at the end of the day, all we know is that it's going to take a fair amount of time for sidechains to ever be supported by Bitcoin core, and it's impossible to look that far into the future with any clarity.Implementing Ethereum as a bitcoin sidechain would be a great idea!
That would be a win-win situation."

This is confusing me. Can someone explain the financial incentives to requesting the file in this way? For both parties involved. > the first entity to supply a transaction with a simplified payment verification-like proof of ownership of the block at that particular index in the tree

This is one spot where I'm unclear. What would the verification look like? Contract provides a random salt and then the file-storer provides a hash of the data with that particular salt? Then assuming I still have the data, I can verify that hash off-chain.  
  
Is that how it's meant to work? I don't think any of the other examples require off-chain work, so I feel like maybe I'm missing something in this explanation. "

- create a completely transparent structure, where salaries are taken off automatically directly from the company account following strict rules of when, how much and to whom

- create a secure system that can alter the system above, with a decentralized identity and roles, so that you could, for example, associated the role of ""manager"" for a fine identity and then structure it so that any salary increase needs to signed off by two other managers and that in order to someone become a manager he needs to be signed on by two board members, etc

- create a market structure in that can decide among the best structure above: should salaries be fixed? Should them be percentages of revenue? Should it be decided by peers or managers?

I'm a big fan of this approach, because it adds more decentralisation and allows innovation: new currencies can come up with new consensus algorithms that fix the problems of others and apps can migrate easily among them, just like migrating from one server to another.

With these changes, Serpent looks quite a bit more like Solidity than it did. At this point, are there strong reasons to use one over the other? to write long lived/ maintainable modular contracts we will need some ability to use a broker/ location service to invoke other contracts.

For example if i'm writing a system that uses some data feeds, I'll want to first implement a broker/ lookup service in between the logic I'm writing, and the data feed. If the data feed becomes unreliable or is superseded, I'll want to submit a change to the lookup service to redirect invocations to the new data feed.

So in short - combination of the name service example but provide a function lookup service to reference other contracts.

Has anyone an example of this?

for Ethereum<->Bitcoin ?that's some science there...Here's a completely unformed random thought I wanted to share.

Let's say Ethereum launches and I create a contract that I want to exist perpetually (for example a multi-generation inheritance)  I have no way of knowing what Blockchains are going to be used in the future.  Maybe Ethereum has solved all scalability issues and is all-pervasive.  Maybe it's Bitcoin + sidechains, or maybe some mingled multichain cloud.

Can anybody envisage a situation where a contract could be purchased from one blockchain and transferred to a second (like a sidechain 2-way peg)?  Maybe it would make more economic sense to be located on a second chain.  Maybe it's more efficient due to the specific hardware resources of the miners on that chain?   The miners on chains B, C, D would place bids to purchase the contract on chain A.

Just thinking that if we've got all these chains popping in and out of existence, could a contract be guaranteed to exist 'on the multichain' in perpetuity.

Anyway hoping there's some shred of sense in there."

> If I launch a DAPP on a bitcojn clone of Ethereum then people will use it since there are a massive number of people.invested in bitcoin.

That's not true. People don't use an app because they have bitcoin, they use an app because it's useful, because their friends use it and because it's easy to use. You are assuming that since the app on the ""bitcoin clone"" (which honestly is not a good way to describe counterparty) is on the blockchain, then it requires bitcoin to be used, and reversely you are supposing that if it's in some other coin blockchain it cannot be used by bitcoin users.

Those assumptions are not necessarily true. You are assuming that one cannot:

1) Transparently use bitcoins to use an app in Ethereum. An app ""being on the bitcoin blockchain"" is not related to an app being able to deal with bitcoins. This isn't a country where you have to be in country X to use currency Y. There can be a tool that allows you to easily deposit bitcoins in address X, which can be watched and then you'd get bitcoin tokens inside ethereum, which could be automatically converted to ether if needed to pay gas. After you used the app, the bitcoin tokens could be ""burned"" and the app could tell the bitcoin address holding those original coins to send X coins back to the holder

2) Acquire ether by other means in a small quantity enough to be able to run simple contracts. Those means include: Mining (we are working on optimising the algorithm for general purpose computers), renting resources like bandwidth or storage or simply getting some free by a faucet.


The true question that needs to be answered are the following:

1) Will Ethereum, the platform (which is larger than ethereum py), offer enough other tools to be an attractive platform for developers?

2) Will Mist the ethereum browser (and other apps based on the platform) be easier to use than the alternatives that are not ethereum-based?

3) Will the technical drawbacks and limitations of building a decentralized computing platform on top of the bitcoin blockchain be bigger than the security advantages of using the existing network (and alternatively, will the positive features of starting a new blockchain be  advantadgeous enough to attract a large network of computers to make the ethereum platform more efficient)?

4) Will the market as a whole, the billion people using facebook who never heard of neither ethereum or bitcoin) even care about decentralized apps?


Steve Jobs once said to Apple employees: ""We have to let go of the notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. In order for Apple to win, Apple has to do a good job"".

We are not trying in any way to undermine bitcoin. Not only the foundation but personally every Ethereum worker has a good stake on bitcoin. We welcome bitcoin users, we love the bitcoin community and we will make as easy as possible for people who have bitcoin and people who have no cryptocurrencies at all, to use our platform. We are building it in a different blockchain because fundamentally we believe in the technical advantadges of being able to do things that probably even Satoshi would have done, if he was building bitcoin knowing what we know today. I don't believe that things will ever be priced in Ether, that is just a way for the market to send messages on what is valuable and what is not.

* [BitVote](https://github.com/BitVote/bitvote).. got a *first version* finished, added stuff for NameReg, but needs a little testing.
* [Assurance contract](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper.github.io/tree/master/eth-entity/assurance_entity): Got it tested, but no interface yet.
* [Tx-swap](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper.github.io/tree/master/eth-entity/tx-swap)... It can trustlessly allow two parties to send transactions for each other. Nearly finished testing, but stumped by bug at the moment.(kindah wanted to run on this counterparty fork thing..)

More like ideas at the moment:

* A contract where different parties put a multiple of ethers/subcoins in, then they agree on a Merkle root, or a list of addresses.(whichever is more efficient) If everyone agrees, each address in the list gets 1/N'th of the ethers/subcoins. Who ends up knowing which address belongs to who depends on how the list is assembled.(it is sort-of a mixing service) Additionally, there may be messages-to-be-sent.

   Probably better anonymization schemes exist. For Bitvote anonymization is desirable too, preferably one where the item voted on cannot be revealed without revealing the private key.
* ""Wallet"" contracts:([messed with writing them](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper.github.io/tree/master/eth-entity/featured_wallet), will start from scratch tho) contracts helping you secure addresses via various mechanisms. N-out-of-M multi-message('multi-sig'), 2-out-of-2-but-second-can-only-delay for 2-factor authentication. Different security levels.(now i think about that, different contracts might better represent different security levels.)

* [Publishing DAO](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper.github.io/tree/master/eth-entity/publishDAO).(old code)(a non-holy-grail one) More interesting to do if we have swarm.(but in principle you could 'simulate' having it)
Other:
* Reputations are important for a lot of things.. Havent got it figured out. Possibly try stuff that is not-entirely figured out but has good properties. (possibly does not require blockchain)
  Could help escrow forward a lot. Could help the holy-grail bit of publishing DAOs.
* OnePerID. My thinking is that reputation helps a lot there. This is also a *key* obstacle for Bitvote.
* [Not-a-dapp](http://wiki.darwinbots.com/w/Main_Page) (probably 256→64bit for that)
* Edit: Hanging blocks.. duhh.. Even if Ethereum is scalable enough, is it scalable enough to have a forum on the blockchain itself? Hanging blocks are. (but their security is typically lower)

Note: 'tested' is relative, i currently call them tested if they have tests going through all the paces. How the paces are run through can be partially random-generated, but the approach is currently not clever about fuzz testing. ([Tools like this](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.nl/2014/11/pulling-jpegs-out-of-thin-air.html) have a better chance than random to find bugs) And they're not reviewed, or gone through step-by-step for accuracy.(at this point, and at this point, that'd be overkill)To answer my own question: My current project is a programming game in the style of Core War or the Google AI Competition, to be played by competing ""DAOs"" on the blockchain.I'm working on a few, but currently focusing on tooling to make the making easier.

- A sort of discussion forum with voting, designed to help decentralized organizations make decisions. 

- A new kind of hypertext system designed to work on peer-to-peer networks.

As some of you might have noticed already, the Solidity compiler is activated in AlethZero by entering some source code that starts with the word ""contract"", but probably it is more convenient to just try Solidity in your browser: [Browser-based Solidity compiler](https://chriseth.github.io/cpp-ethereum/)

Note that the planned IDE will be different, this is only to be able to play with Solidity with prerequisites close to zero. One drawback of the browser interface is that you cannot execute or debug contracts, but you will get parse errors and the compiled bytecode. It is pre-filled with an example contract that should explain most of the features, otherwise please ask here or on IRC. It may be wise to disable the optimizer while writing (untick the ""optimize"" checkbox). Furthermore, the emscripten build is an unofficial build and will only be updated manually by me for 

The browser interface is powered by the wonderful project [emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/), which compiles the Solidity compiler written in C++ to javascript, so that it can be used directly in the browser without a server-side backend.

Current limitations of Solidity (which will all be resolved in the future):

* no access to blockchain data (query balance, block number, etc.)
* no access to other contracts
* no way to send messages / transactions
* no constructor / init function
* no structs as local variables or function arguments, only the first return value can be accessed in local calls
* no real, string or text types (only uint*, int*, hash*, address and bool are supported)
""const"" is not enforced
* functions can fail to compile if expressions are too complex or if there are too many variables (access to only the topmost 16 stack element)

I was tempted to start to look at rate control mechanisms and security, however that will have to wait until the sequel.  I suspect that I will need to reproduce Vitalik's Monty Carlo simulations of the modified Ghost Protocol when carrying out the security analysis of this thing.Mmm, can someone ELI5 me the conclusions of the tests? Does the random circuit seem discourages mining pools? Does is look like it will really be ASIC resistance?> The system is admittedly rather complicated; this is because its original intent was to thwart an easy implementation in an ASIC.

Partly, the approach is to be Turing complete. That said, even if the mining algorithm is usable for general computing, that doesnt preclude that an ASIC is possible, but at least the ASIC design might have aspects making it useful for computing.(i.e. CPUs are ASICs for general computing)

> Fundamentally, the compute pool cannot mine any faster than its fastest miner.

To be honest, i dont quite understand. Surely trustful pooled mining is just like two separate miners, and they have ~×2 shot ""in the perfect case"".

> In the classic BitCoin model this didn't matter, since effectively S=1 and mini∈IC\_i can be taken to be small. 

Not sure what this means.. You mean individual mining attempts dont take long? However, cant paralel mining attempts be used, and pooling still be useful merely for not running a full node..

If individual mining attempts take long relative to block time(time a winning block is applicable) makes mining possibly superlinear. If a mining attempt is forced onto a single machine, it makes it superlinear with regard to the speed of the machine. The reason being is that it increases the probability that a solution is found during an mining attempt, essentially wasting the mining attempt, or giving it a lower probability of being accepted as a block if published.

Note that if you have `F(X) > difficulty` for some function suitable as mining function `F`, then you can lengthen each attempt at the cost of taking more time to check aswel `F(F(F(X)))) > D`, for instance.

What variance are we controlling? Part of the reason for the existance of mining pools is that otherwise payout is too uncertain. So it is set to the block time. A solution in giving multiple rewards per block, some with lower difficulty solutions that can be claimed with a transaction has been suggested. However, i think it leads to superlinearity somewhat, as the block maker can put in his mini-rewards before the others.. I am sure it has other issues.(a thread somewhere in the forum, but cant find it)> Of course, a miner could also try to compose other SAT problems with varying solutions, which is in NP.

Does this mean that the criteria you impose on the problem are sufficient to provide a provable lower bound on the difficulty of obfuscating a simple SAT problem into one which looks more complex?"

2014-11-25 13:14:34;Proof of Stake: How I Learned to Love Weak Subjectivity [ethereum blog];">we can clearly see how proof of stake works perfectly fine: **we simply forbid nodes from reverting more than N blocks**, and set N to be the security deposit length. That is to say, if state S has been valid and has become an ancestor of at least N valid states, then from that point on no state S’ which is not a descendant of S can be valid. Long-range attacks are no longer a problem, for the trivial reason that we have simply said that long-range forks are invalid as part of the protocol definition. This rule clearly is weakly subjective, with the added bonus that X = 100% (ie. no attack can cause permanent disruption unless it lasts more than N blocks).

Isn't that how NXT works?[deleted]Shouldn't it be 0.9 + 0.1 = 1.0 in the nothing at stake image?

EDIT - yeah I see what's going on, the () / 2 part has been omitted from that and subsequent images.I'm somebody who made a very large (by my standards) purchase of Ether.  I was expecting the total amount of Ether to increase every year by 26%.

From the blog posts it seems that the Ethereum team are looking at some hybrid PoS-type solution, which from what I have read would result in a lot less new currency being created.  From a purely selfish, speculative standpoint should I be happy about this?After hearing Vitalik speak at WeWork last week, can't wait to read this!!/u/vbuterin could you throw out some numbers or give an example of how POS would effect someone who had 20k Ether (acquired in the pre-sale) and starts mining day one vs someone that joins the ecosystem two years after Genesis and starts with zero Ether.

I agree with your thinking on this issue. POW is not the long-term solution. And I think you're on the right track and it's very clear that your intentions are well aimed. IMHO I don't think there can be a solution that will be 100% fair to everyone (and we'll prob just have to live with that fact). More important will be the effects of decentralize that will positively affect EVERYONE on the planet including those that don't mine on the network or even know what Ethereum is. That is the fairness and balance that will ultimately be achieved. Wow. 

When I first heard of proof-of-stake, I thought it was a cool idea, then I read about critical security flaws, especially ""nothing at stake"". 

This is a very compelling argument that it can be made to work after all. Very nice work Vitalik!Hi there, I just have a couple of questions if that's ok.

1) With this sentence - 

> If there are 1000 stakeholders, and each of their activity has a 1% chance of being “pivotal” in contributing to a successful attack that will knock coin value down to zero, then each stakeholder will accept a bribe equal to only 1% of their holdings.

I'm not really sure why they'd accept a bribe of 1% of their holdings.  Are we saying that a network participant would/should pay 1% of their holdings to reduce the chance of losing everything from 1% to 0%?

2) When Vitalik says ""once the deposit is withdrawn there's no longer any incentive not to vote on a long-range fork starting far back in time"".  I think I was initially confused here, because in a PoW system anybody can broadcast what's basically a ""alternate reality"" of blocks.  That alternate blockchain would not contain the transaction whereby the initial deposit was made, therefore they wouldn't have been deposited in the first place.  So why would the user need to wait till they were freed up in Reality #1 to use them in Reality #2 where they were never taken away in the first place.

Then I thought about it some more, and it's simply because of the way that PoS works.  When you get a chance to vote, you're not broadcasting blocks you're saying ""this was the correct fork.""  If your stake has been withheld then you can't make that vote.  Am I along the right lines?

3) Lastly, the whole 'caught cheating by voting on multiple forks' concept.  The way I understand it, an alternative fork would just be discarded data (just like orphaned blocks in PoW).  How can you put proof of a transaction involving something that's been discarded in the main blockchain?  There wouldn't be data for the miners to reference.

Anyway if somebody could answer these questions I'd appreciate it.  I've read the blog post three times now, I guess my knowledge of Ethereum isn't really up to scratch right now.
So, is it still in the blue?  PoW first, then PoS? Or directly to PoS?Vitalik, I love your work, and I think you're brilliant.  Since 2012 or so, I thought that smart contracts would be a huge development, and I'm quite excited to see you developing a currency that implements it.  But with all respect, please stop doing research on how to improve Ethereum and finish making a product.  Otherwise, a fork of the code will be completed before you ever release.

You have obligations to your investors, and it's naive to think it's possible to ever make the ""perfect"" cryptocurrency.  For now on, currency will improve incrementally just like any other technology (though I cannot imagine the timescales).

Otherwise, I personally think you should make it clear that you're the cryptocurrency researcher who founded Ethereum and not a full-time developer for Ethereum."

Probably doesn't matter unless there's a load of activity at the time or a very wide set of owners who don't agree on the fork!

Interesting question though.

They must have done similar in the past for bitcoin's hard forks. Did they manage it by having a small number of major miners who just agreed how and when to do it?> The only thing that we can be sure of is that ETH 1.0 ether tokens will be transferable to an ETH 2.0 blockchain.

2014-12-04 13:11:37;Ether price kept artificially high affecting cost of all trade on network;"Ether price is not the same as gas cost. As long as there are miners willing to accept reasonable transaction fees (and why wouldn't they?), the cost of Ether itself is irrelevant.Each miner has to decide which of the available transactions to include, and they personally get the fees from the transactions they include in the block, and with the current specification the number of transactions in a block is limited only by a cap on the gas spent per block, so the highest gas price transactions will be included first, until the block is full or all known transactions are included. So the price will be set entirely by demand, and the equilibrium is gas_demand_at(gasprice)/block = gaslimit/block.> No different from how the oil price is keep artificially high in many countries 

This seems really different to me actually: These high prices are due to taxes applied at the time of the sale, unrelated to market forces (which is what will determine the price of ether)

> isnt it theoretically possible that those who hold ether could decide to keep the price artificially high and thus affect the price of conducting business on ethereum?

This is a classic ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" situation. Yes, if EVERYBODY who owns ether refuses to sell it, you are right that prices could be kept artificially high. However, it would be in the interest of any individual holder to cash out their ether in that situation to reap an enormous profit. The hope is that ether will be distributed widely enough that this type of ""cartel"" cannot form and that we will instead have an open market.

With an open market, price manipulation is very difficult. I'm pretty certain that 99% of the time when people complain about bitcoin or gold price manipulation they are just complaining about losing money and have no evidence of actual manipulation to back up their claims.

(In the stock market price manipulation is more rampant, due to the availability of lots of insider information, but that does not exist to the same extent with ether or Bitcoin)I'm not an economic expert but Oil is consumed when it is used - ether is not."

That would lower the barrier to entry for the average person.Sorry i didn't answer before, I've been away for a few days. 

Mist is a end user browser, so the question of it will include mining depends ultimately if a end user can actually mine in a home computer. We might even do a test to determine if the users computer is able to do it or not. I believe the experience of having ""mining turned on"" but never getting any reward is worse than not having mining at all.  

But ultimately your question is about how users can get started with ether and that's am definitely something we worry about. We intend to include, in the signup process, a link to all or most of the dapps that can do that, like:

* hard disk space renting (IPFS)

* VPN as services (Lantern project)

* CPU markets (Golem Project)

* artificial artificial intelligence services  (Mechanical Turk)

* Any kind of faucet or giveaway project that seems fair

This depends ultimately on the community having those ready as soon as possible. As with all the dapps on our starting screen, the list will be updated constantly..
This would be absolutely amazing. It would take the 'scary' element of mining away entirely (for less-techy people).Another even simpler implementation may be to have a ""mine ether"" button link to the download page for the full node client.

These block chain computers will allow us to put the most crucial parts of our online protocols on a far more reliable and secure footing, and make possible fiduciary interactions that we previously dared not do on a global network  > But the limits of Bitcoin's language and its tiny memory mean it can't be used for most other fiduciary applications, the most obvious example being risk pools that share collateral across a pool of financial instruments.

2014-12-11 20:50:10;Ethereum and Evil;"Your question hits a deeper question beyond Ethereum -- rather it's a question about being digital in itself, and being on a network. 

Forget these fancy 2.0 movements - you don't have to look past the current web. If you really wanted to and looked hard enough, you will find all these nasty things you mentioned, and more. You upload the schematics for a 3d-printed gun once, your site will get taken down - but have they *really* taken it down? Same goes for nude pics, government leaks....Bytes are trickier than atoms. And that's all without Ethereum!

So this isn't a hard answer really, but rather just a musing -- we live in interesting times. The record/film industry had to adjust as it faced its new digital reality -- still is, but they're slowly finding their way. What I do have a sense of is, is that this train will not stop. It's scary because we're facing an unknown. We'll have to adapt and make sense of it as we go along.Like other crime in society, the public will be isolated from it by default - they don't want to see that. Authorities et al will try to fight it by whatever means are sufficiently palatable. It'll be easier for the internet public to witness crime, which will probably make them uncomfortable. It probably won't make crime much easier for professional criminals, either, but if it does that'll reduce their profit margins, although the volume might increase. The real question, though, is if we can stop people from using ethereum to fund roko's basilisk. I typed a longer answer but it was lost in the airport wifi limbo. Is in short:

* You can't have secrets in the blockchain, so any ransom that needs to only reveal a key under conditions isn't yet possible. 

* Undeletable information is already a reality with torrents. Try to take down the leaked  celebrity nudes or the 3D gun designs if you don't believe it. 

* You can have some evil uses with crime contracts that are bets that reward of something bad happens, but the problem is that those are undistinguishable from normal insurance contracts. A contract that gives a reward to someone if a third party dies is a terrible crime of the two parties are political enemies, but actually a very advisable contract if the two parties are spouses buying life insurance. To distinguish the two you'd have to lose anonymity and measure intent, which are undesirable and impossible 

* Finally there is the possibility of an evil DAC, a contact which automates some sort of criminal organized activity. But for those to work the whole untested concept of DACs have to work, and if these do it means that you can realistically replace governments entities and big corporations, in a more efficient manner with a transparent contract, a sort of automation of the top executives instead of the bottom workers. If that's true then it means that Ethereum will change society in both good, bad and unpredictable ways. It may be useful to approach this question from the opposite direction: In what ways might Ethereum improve the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies?

* Blockchain-embedded investigation logs
* Reduced administration
* Computational power and related services available to state and local agencies for breaking encryption
* Securely distributable criminal databases 
* Autonomous dash-cams identifying and reporting number plates, faces, etc
* Digital management of jurisdictions for more seamless inter-agency coordination

At a more systemic level, we might look at laws and punishments as structured incentives. Digital, programmatic laws and punishments can be more responsive to human behaviour - somewhat nearer to being immediate, proportional, and scientifically designed. I suppose you hit on one of the worst there alright in your OP- child abuse/pornography. I suppose Ethereum wouldnt exactly enable that, it would just make it a little harder for our current legal and policing systems prevent (which of course they should, could and will continue to punish). 

Interesting video posted today of a talk Gavin gave, in which he kind of explains that it will necessitate authorities to go after law breakers directly rather than through the service providers they use to do whatever they shouldn't

Also things like organised crime, hit man service, drug deals, insider trading, fraud, money laundering, political corruption, tax evasion.

Most ""evil"" uses of Ethereum are just quick ways to empty the account of the would-be evildoer.

But it's great that we're at the moral panic stage of the adoption curve. ;-)Perhaps it would be more productive to have more sense of what is not possible than speculate what might be possible?

Could a disruptive script be written that affects other scripts?.. If that's possible then you have potential anti-virus or anti-evil.. the limit of that being that such a script needs to be paid but so does all law. If it's not possible to disrupt a script, then surely the network could be at risk from a well funded evil script or the reputation that the network would aquire?.. and would the devs or the consensus that is society tolerate that?.. or would they simply clone a better version that did limit evil - if only through vetting and licensing or plus ability to disable scripts.

For all the uber liberal backing, it's typically only a fraction of society that would support such a network..???> instructions for ultra-cheap biochemical weapons

Edit: I want to point out though to whoever is working on the solidity syntax that I'm overall pleased with the design, I think it's a good approach with lots of promise.BTW, contract publishing in AlethZero seems to be broken in the latest build.  Could you let me know if you get your contract to publish?

To compile your solidity code, just paste it into the data field of the transaction panel like you would Serpent or LLL.Oh Solidity, you make us all yo bitch :( There is no reference yet, thet tutorial is as close as it gets. For all features that exist, there should be a test in the [end to end tests](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/blob/develop/test/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp).

*arrays*:
Solidity does not yet support arrays. As pointed out in other comments, mappings can be used as an inefficient replacement for arrays in storage. Netiher structs nor mappings can be passed to or returned from functions for now.

*calls to other contracts*:
Basically, you have to know the ABI specs of the contract you want to call, if it is an ABI contract. To do this, for now, you have to put an ""interface"" of that contract above your actual contract, just leaving the functions blank. The rest should be clear from the tutorial.
If it is not an ABI contact, you are left with callstring32string32 and callstring32, but it is planned to improve this (basically there will be just ""call"" and it derives the types from its arguments).To make an array, use a mapping.

e.g.  mapping (uint8 => uint) integers;  makes an array of size 256 (named integers) that maps to 256bit uints.

Not sure how to call another contract with arguments.  I was under the impression that methods are numbered, not named.  Maybe someone else can answer this.Solidity is currently under heavy development and so things are going to be changing fast. Documentation will come as soon as things stabilize a bit more.

If you want to look at examples of cutting edge code you can always look at our tests. I would recommend you looking at the end to end tests.

2014-12-31 10:55:42;"""On Silos"" by Vitalik Buterin - ethereum blog [direct link]";"Reposting this as the other one had that horrid, nasty iframe used to monetize other people's work. >Some people see cryptocurrency as a capitalist revolution, others see it as an egalitarian revolution, and others see everything in between.

That's why it's here to stay.Great post.  I agree.

I think I basically said this before, but I strongly believe that there can and eventually will be technology that facilitates not only universal systems interface but also systems definition and exchange of system definition.

Something like a virtual machine is a starting point for thinking about this.  For example, the system Ethereum uses or an LLVM or a Java VM.  Say you understand that.  Now go read about ""knowledge representation and reasoning"".  Check out the OWL Manchester syntax.

We should be able to describe our systems in a high-level general purpose machine processable way and automatically generate code in our favorite programming languages.  Having a common language to exchange algorithms and high-level definitions will make it possible to take advantage of technology in collaborations.  Without something sophisticated, powerful, and universal like that, even when the programmers and next-gen economists stop arguing, they still will have to sit there and stare at specifications and semantically useless REST APIs and manually interface and implement.  Or if someone happens to implement a component in a programming language that is not their favorite, they will have to manually port or interface with it.

This is not in any way a new problem.  Its not an easy problem to solve.  I believe it has been a largely unrecognized and massively neglected problem in computer science.

Without the systems being able to communicate with a common language, we will always have to rely on human programmers to slowly and unreliably translate.

Most programming languages have MUCH more in common than people realize.  Most of the cryptocurrency concepts have not changed that quickly.  But there is no standard way to describe them that is machine processable.

I believe you want to start at a higher level than algorithms in many cases actually.  The algorithms often describe how to achieve something, but just as important is having a way to understand WHAT they are trying to achieve.

The solution is NOT to build all of the low-level components in C++.  I could have gone along with that in the 1980s, but its 2015."
2014-12-31 08:03:51;SchellingCoins in practice - would appreciate comments;"It sounds like you're thinking in a sensible direction, but some initial comments:

> you'd have to run another program to get the required data.

So, the idea behind SchellingCoin is that you DONT need to get data from the outside world... Are you saying the contract is a schellingcoin contract, with a schellingcoin-style API, and that you are giving users an additional program (NOT schelling-style, since it interacts with the outside world) that feeds data into the contract? So does that mean the contract will reward those people who's datafeed resembles the mathematical mode? (i.e. the most common value, i.e. hopefully the ""real"" value)

> Of course, there may be rogues, but that's the inherent nature of the SchellingCoins approach.

OK, suppose there's 1000 honest users participating... how do you prevent a SINGLE rogue from firing up 1001 docker containers, linked to 1001 separate anonymous ether wallets? If your answer is ""it would be too expensive to do so"" realize that this would significantly hamper the utility of your schellingcoin system, since it's primary purpose will be to execute financial contracts that ideally involve significant sums and provide lots of incentive to cheat.

(Not trying to knock your idea, I agree something like what you describe could probably serve a valuable role, I'm just trying to understand myself how big that role can be...)> The users receive a vagrant/docker machine ready for action. The advantages of vagrant/docker are isolation and the ability to deploy on cloud platforms immediately.

This all seems overly complicated.  If you don't mind using dockerhub, couldn't you just push a container there, and just do `docker pull <repo/container> ; docker run <repo/container>` ?"

1) If you don't have leverage to negotiate good deals in a contract, no new technology will help you out. In fact, by making contracts impossible or hard to break out from, it might get even worse. Of course Ethereum is suited for things that are happening inside computers, so unless we're talking about the rights of an avatar inside a video game, then digital contracts are hard to enforce in a environment which is very meat based.


2) Decentralisation is a strategy, it's not suited for all occasions: sometimes there's a exponential proportionality to joining forces . I would bet that at any point in the year, there is always some kind of important international olympic sporting event going on: some very important marathon in new york or the finals of the rhythmic gymnasts competition happening in ukraine. But still, when you put them all happening in one central location, controlled by one group then boom, you've got the olympics and everyone in the world is paying attention. Maybe this also happens in UFC, where smaller independent fights are never as popular as the joined forces of all leagues?

2015-01-15 09:15:29;What incentive do developers have for creating apps on Ethereum?;"Developers will be able to charge for apps, as long as they can create an impetus for people not to switch to cheaper apps. One way to do this may be a network effect, building an app that's more valuable if everyone is using the same one.You'd create something on Ethereum if it is cheaper, more convenient, or more possible for you to do so.

You can charge for using services on Ethereum to the extent that they do something useful, just like services on the Web.

To take the Kickstarter example, Kickstarter already exists so it's not clear why you'd re-implement it in Rails or node.js or any other platform either. But if you really wanted to remake the Kickstarter wheel, it would be more transparent and more secure to do so in Ethereum.

You can charge people for using the service implemented in your DApp, I don't understand why that wouldn't be possible.

As for adoption, every new platform has its adoption dynamics. But you can hide Ethereum behind a web server if you want to, and Mist is an easy install with a good UI so it's not like the average user is beign asked to install GNU/Linux just to play Cow Clicker.. ;-)Think of Ðapps as companies or tools. Why would someone build a company, tool or business if they can't sell it immediately? 

The answer is either (1) because that person has a business plan on *using* the Ðapp, (2) because he needs that tool for his own purposes and doesn't mind sharing or (3) because he has other personal incentives to do that, like learning, pleasure or ideology.[deleted]Developers have an incentive if they want to take part of the dapp's output. Regarding costs for development, crowdfunding/donations/etc can be used. Additionally, many applications are *much* easier to develop on Ethereum than in a traditional server-client setting, so that's definitely a selling point for developers as well.Same reason as Linux exists[deleted]"

2015-01-22 12:44:16;An Ethereum Uptopia;"> At some point if that keeps up, I envision a society where people are able to get the basic necessities like food and shelter completely free or else very very cheap, and don't have to worry about working. The government would eventually have to do something to address the rising unemployment rate due to all the DAOs, so paying people a living wage and supplying them with free food sounds like a start.

That's the optimist's vision. The pessimist view a world where instead of 1% of the population owning 90% of all wealth, most of the wealth will be owned by robots and faceless, leaderless, humanless corporations that can't be stopped. 

Let's hope you're right.I've posted this before but I guess it's relevant here too. Here's a snapshot of your potential future :)

""You wake up, and see that $17.27 was automatically deducted from your primary wallet, as you had authorized to happen every day, to pay the rent for your apartment; if you cancelled the authorization, then after a warning period ownership in the land registry contract would automatically transfer back to the landlord and the door lock would no longer recognize signatures signed by your smartphone’s private key as valid for letting you in. Of course, your landlord is bound by the same restrictions - if he shuts off his account paying the local government $6.60 land value tax per day, then he loses ownership and the contract automatically switches over so you are renting from the government instead. The government itself is simply a large decentralized organization, and you can see in real time the $6.60 moving on the blockchain and eventually getting into an account to pay for a medical research program trying to extend the human lifespan from 170 years to 230.

The internet that you are using to access this information is based on OpenGarden, which by then is a mature decentralized and incentivized mesh networking platform; you also paid $0.0009 to access the information, but your laptop also earned $0.0014 transmitting other people's packets at the same time.

You then get up, and get into your Mastercar self-driving car to go to work (originaly, all self-driving cars were made by Google, but Master Corporation, a decentralized autonomous entity that automatically uses a combination of futarchy and liquid democracy to determine how the company should spend its funds each day, proved that its governance mechanism was so efficient that it overtook Google on some core services within three years, and alt-Mastercorps took over most of its other operations). You get in, and Mastercar runs a optimized version of the A* search algorithm (for which James Wilbur automatically got a bounty of $782,228 worth of MSC from the Master Contract) to determine the optimal path to your primary workplace. Given that your self-tracking app has detected that you value your own time (or rather, the delta between time spent in a car versus time spent at home or work) at an average of $14.18 per hour, the Mastercar’s algorithm chooses a route which takes an extra 11 minutes in order to avoid road tolls and also on the way move a shipment from one side of the city to the other. You drive out, and 30 minutes later you have spent $1.04 on electricity for your car, $1.39 on road tolls, but receive a reward of $2.60 for moving the shipment over.

You arrive at work - a location which is a hybrid living/working space where “employees” of five different alt-versions of Master Corporation are spending most of their time, except that you chose to live at home because you have a family. You then get to work, running simulations of a proposed new scalability algorithm for the now community/DAO-driven Ethereum 6.0."" - Vitalik Buterin, [Reddit AMA July 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/2bjmgb/hi_we_are_the_ethereum_project_team_ask_us/).This *Uptopia* doesn't have *spell check*??? ;)Ethereum is not high level enough to be a practical solution to automation. It's a primitive implementation of an obvious idea, and people will quickly understand the limits of the platform. More than anything, it lacks a high-level framework to represent the world, general semantics."
2015-01-22 07:50:57;An ethereum app store for Android?;"Id rather see an Ethereum mobile osOur focus is to release ethereum for desktop platforms, only when that is done well we'll focus on mobile.

As part of their project with Samsung, IBM worked on an android port but I don't know what will be done with that.There is no specific plan internally to create an Android only appstore.

However, as you may have seen in the news recently, IBM is creating an Android based ethereumj light client as part of the ADEPT project. This client would be usable on most Android devices, so I can see a store being created by the community in the not too distant future.

As to why would devs publish on it? Simple - the mobile market is already massive and still growing exponentially. Mobile computing is also very [popular in the developing world](http://qz.com/329123/melinda-bill-gates-foundation-annual-letter-mobile-banking/), and many DApps that would compete with existing services in the developed world may well go unchallenged as a similar service might not exist. 

This is pretty awesome as it effectively allows developing countries to leapfrog the developed world from a technological perspective :)It might help that Google now supports Go in Android. They can just port the Go client for it (with a different material UI of course).Love the idea! Would be great to have something like fdroid ( FOSS App-Store ) but in distributed.

2015-01-21 20:09:46;Mining Ethereum for a beginner;"The algorithm used is one called a dagger-hashimoto, which is made to resist ASIC mining, meaning it's meant for general purpose computers. It means that it's quite possible you'll be able to mine in your home computer, but that doesn't prevent corporations to use tons of high end computers to do the same. There will be other ways to earn ether, like renting your hard drive.

Instead of focusing on the mining aspect with your kids, try to think about the other kinds of things that you'll be able to do with it. I look forward to mining, but I don't expect anybody to make a lot of money mining. If transactions are going to be as cheap as possible then mining has got to be energy efficient (meaning less compensation for miners).

However, I don't think they should be obligated to teach business owners how to run their companies. This is the place where a company needs to hire a specialist in blockchain tech. > If Ethereum is to succeed, it needs to start reaching out to people and showing them how to make their business more effective using blockchain technology. It needs to tell people why on earth they’re mining it and how what they mine works, rather than publishing endless papers on GPU efficiency and mining algorithm debates. They need to show people what the internet looks like if we all become citizens rather than anonymous drones. Don’t just tell us what the mathematical concept behind your consensus identity is, show us how it looks for someone who can’t tell you what a variable is.

2015-01-29 07:46:22;Contract sending a whisper envelopes / message;"Contracts have no way of actively interfacing with the ""outside world"". Although it would be horribly expensive, the proof of work can in principle be computed by a contract (since the EVM is Turing complete), but it is not possible for the contract to send whisper messages to the whisper network.
The user interface of the dapps are the controlling entities that can interface with the three Ethereum subcomponents (eth, whisper and swarm) while eth, the consensus engine containing the contracts, is a rather passive element in this ecosystem.Performing a PoW within a contract is going to be a very, very expensive way to do this.  Since the consensus engine (every full node) is going to do the entire calculation, you will need to pay a fair amount of gas to get it done.  But, feed it enough gas and a contract can perform any computation.  So, yea sure you can pay a contract to generate whisper protocol outputs.

I'm so glad you posted this Vitalik (and I suppose i should really thank Andrew Miller), because it reminded me of something.

Back in Feb 2014, we were having a spirited debate on IRC, at the inception of the Bitsquare project, about whether you can use a 2 of 2 multisig to remove the incentive to defraud in a fiat for bitcoin trade. We went through various defences and attacks, and at one point I found a very interesting podcast that seemed to illustrate what I thought was the key issue:

http://www.radiolab.org/story/golden-rule/

(listen to it if you like, it's only 20 minutes and quite entertaining, or I'll explain in short here: they set up a single round of Prisoner's Dilemma to decide how the game show's prize money is split between two finalists. Payoff zero if you cooperate and the counterparty defects.)

So one guy (A) comes up with a clever trick: he announces to his counterparty B that he will *definitely* defect, but will split the money after the game. (The argument starts around 13 minutes in the podcast). The audience goes crazy, everyone hates him (A), but he just insists again and again that he will defect. B is eventually convinced and so has no choice but to choose cooperate ('split' they call it), thus giving the money to the first guy, who promises to hand over half the money at the end. It's obvious what happens at the end - A chooses the split ball anyway.

The bottom line is that this is just a confidence game, but as you can say it can be made a matter of contract - 'A' in this game could have written a legally binding contract somewhere that he will choose to defect, or he could use smart contracts. Either way the same goal is achieved - to convince the other side of your action. And although these Schelling constructs are more advanced because of the number of participants, I think what Miller is showing here is that it's basically the same story.

I do understand that of course there are what you call 'altruism' issues, which could well be incentive issues, but we're interested in fundamentals here.

I'm going to read your proposed solutions carefully, but I sometimes wonder if your ingenuity is a blessing or a curse :)"

2015-02-05 14:57:46;HFT On Ethereum;"It appears you are misunderstanding a bit on how ethereum works..

I'm not sure any blockchain technology will compete with a centralised  high bandwidth for millisecond trades. Ethereum has a 12 second block time, so this means that if your transaction propagates fast enough to all the network, then it will take at least an average of 12 seconds before it's confirmed for the first time. If there are multiple incompatible transactions (a double spend coming from the same account) then probably the one with a higher fee will win, but there's an element of chance there.

If a contract is selling something that can only go to one person, then it would not be very smart for it to just give it to the very first buyer, as it will be based on transactions fees and a bit of luck. Instead it would ideally work as a small auction in each block, so in average each 12 seconds the contract would gather all the bidders who go their transaction in the block and give whatever they were selling to the highest bidder, or according to whatever auction method you pick. In this sense all you have to do is give a transaction fee hight enough to be included in the next block.

So in this sense it would not be a high frequency trading, it would be a 12 second block trade.

But honestly, can you explain to me again what is the true benefit of millisecond trading?"

Here's a way to thwart miners: instead of making the roulette wheel based on `block.prevhash`, try using `sha3([block.prevhash, block.nonce], 2)`.  Mining is hard enough, but now this forces the miner to not only mine the ETH but also ""mine"" your roulette wheel.  If you want to make it even harder, you can iterate `sha3(sha3(sha3([block.prevhash, block.nonce], 2)))`, since `sha3` is a costly procedure for GPUs.Looks great.

See [my thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2vko6s/dapp_manager_systems/) posted shortly before yours.I actually agree this is a good idea. If they added this opcode it would make my life much easier... and I don't see any real downsides. Seems like a good ethereum v1.1 enhancement.

InB4 vbuterin explains why this is obviously a horrible idea.Would it not be possible to just implement a contract such that if the contract receives a message from all affected parties permitting an update then the contract could transfer all of the assets of the current contract to a new contract with new code and a new state?

2015-02-19 22:23:08;Decentralized storage;"More or less it'd involve other people renting out idle hardware space for a small income of ether, and the master contract somehow allowing for formal proofs that the stored data persists.[1] Swarm would probably be what you'd use to interface Ethereum with some sort of bulk data storage, and requests.

The greatest benefit would probably be permanency, and prevention of censuring, or otherwise take downs. 
It could also be a great way to store files without needing to trust any single source. Or, simply a great way for people that have no stake to get their initial deposit. :p

If it's specifically cheaper? (If you are using IPFS as the medium, *probably*; otherwise) [t]hat would require to know the gas rates for uploading, downloading, delivery, and incentives. However, you wouldn't have to personally bother with dropbox (user data), renting servers, or hopefully file size~

Though this doesn't prevent you from hooking up a central server through Swarm or something else. It'd probably be normal. Then the main benefit would be Ethereum, or Swarm as a distribution layer.


1, There's probably more to it to that, like: Encryption for Privacy, M of N Schemes for Availability or Safety, Some sort of DHT to make sure peers can coordinate storage or distribution..."

2015-02-19 16:01:38;Interaction with Bitcoin blockchain;"My project CryptoCoinWatch (https://github.com/EtherCasts/cryptocoinwatch) does exactly this: it is an Ethereum datafeed to watch the amount received of crypto currencies.

`btcrelay` is another project which tries to go around some of the trust issues by verifying actual blocks and transactions. I have no idea how it exactly works and it is under heavy development :) https://github.com/ethers/dapp-bin/tree/btcrelay/btcrelay

You've basically answered your own question :)

Ethereum smart contacts cant contact have no access from the outside world and can only get information from transactions sent to them - ergo you need oracles, voting pools, SchellingCoin etc.

Yep, you pretty much answered your own question.

The fundamental issue is that ethereum contracts can only ""know"" and interact with things that every node knows about. The only way you could have trustless interaction with bitcoin was if the bitcoin block chain became a part of the ethereum block chain and consensus mechanism (which is perhaps some of what side chains aspires to be?). 

The other alternative as you note is that you instead reference a source on the ethereum block chain that claims to reference the bitcoin block chain, but you have to make the decision yourself whether that source can be trusted. 

With advanced reputation systems this will possibly become a lot easier and you could e.g. ""buy"" an information feed on Augur that monitors and reports on the status of one or several bitcoin addresses. Even if the reward you pay is relatively low, the cost of lying by an attacker will still be extremely high as they would lose their reputation tokens for the entire platform.There will need to be specialized nodes that act as relays between multiple blockchains. These nodes will run a full client on each blockchain with software connecting the clients, such as [Decerver](https://decerver.io/). They may interact with oracle, reputation, or prediction market systems to provide information across chains. They might also be stakeholders in a DAO who need to run such a relay for the DAO to work (ex an ethereum DAO that sends/receives bitcoins).

In the future (Ethereum 2.0 or beyond) it will be possible for a DAO to contain a private key without exposing it to the public, in which some functionality provided by cross-chain relays isn't necessarily needed. For example a DAO containing a bitcoin private key can ""send"" the BTC in that address to someone else by relinquishing control of the DAO to them. The private key was generated and lives encrypted in the DAO, and is only exposed if the contracts are destroyed, ensuring recipients do not need to check on the bitcoin blockchain if funds are still at the address, since no one could have previously gotten the private key out to spend them on the BTC blockchain.Thanks for the answers.  
It provokes to me the question how much of the usefulness and the capabilities of Ethereum contract system is left, if critical input data comes from an outside semi-trusted system (oracle, voting pool, schelling coin,...). Those systems could then be used to handle much more tasks as only providing a data feed. It might be cheaper and more efficient to use them also for the state transition process and use the Ethereum ledger primary for storage, which would reduce a lot the main reason for preferring Ethereum over other block chains. Of course its great to be able to build complex processes inside the Ethereum world, but I think the real interesting stuff is that what interacts with outside data.
I think for some use cases SPV clients (using BitcoinJ) can be used and every client in a P2P network is doing the verification but that will not work for all situations (if a Bitcoin tx changes the state on the Ethereum side).
My primary use case would be to issue a token as a Ethereum sub currency when a certain Bitcoin transaction has occured. But that token creation must be verified or done in a trsutless way by a contract. So I don't see an easy solution to solve that. I don't know if what I am saying would work, but here I go.
I think I heard something about a contract which acts as a light client? I'm not remembering clearly. But, if I do happen to remember that part correctly, maybe I also remember the following correctly.:
Maybe you could have a contract which stores a recent block header from the bitcoin blockchain (idk how expensive it is to store a block header.)
And then every few bitcoin blocks, someone could send the contract information regarding the next few block headers (which the contract would validate), to get the contract caught up about the bitcoin blockchain. Then, if someone wants to know about some particular transaction that happened in the bitcoin blockchain (i.e. ""look up a transaction""),

They would send the contract some ether to pay for the service (in addition to the gas), requesting information about the transaction. Then, another user who has a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain would send the information about the transaction to the contract, and include a proof that the transaction in question was in the blockchain. This would be done (I think) by sending:

* the bitcoin transaction

* a merkle tree proof that the given transaction fits with the merkle root hash for the block the transaction was in (including the merkle root hash)

* the block header of the block the transaction was in

* some sort of proof that the block header containing the transaction is an ancestor of the block considered to be recent. The simple way for this would be all the block headers in between, but that might lead to unaffordable gas costs for sufficiently old blocks. Idk if bitcoin has any way that would make it only take log(n) headers instead?

Then the person who provided the transaction and the proof that the transaction is accurate would receive (most of) the payment that the first user paid (which would have to be more than the gas cost to be worth it), and the contract would send a message to the first user with the description of the transaction.

This does have some problems which I don't know the solution to (but suspect that others know a solution). Some of these are:

* how to insure that the block header that the contract keeps track of does not end up being a block from a fork in the bitcoin blockchain.

* how to cheaply prove that the block header of the block with the transaction is an ancestor of the most recent (known) block

I expect that someone has already done all of this, assuming that it is possible.
I might be misremembering some things."
2015-02-18 14:58:02;Economic Modeling of Ether, the cryptofuel;"price will correlate with adoption in the long run. That's about the best economic model its possible to come up with.

In the short run the price will swing wildly and be dominated by speculation with no real connection to fundamentals, just like bitcoin.> this will no doubt influence the price of Ether, the native cryptofuel.

This is incorrect.

Gas is the native cryptofuel and the price of gas depends only indirectly on the price of ether."

Going forward, the plan is to meet the first Thursday of every month. For the foreseeable future we'll be using the DBC as our spot - however we'll probably mix things up once in awhile and head to a centrally-located bar/restaurant/mental institution.

If you'd like to present something Ethereum-related - please let me know. While I'm happy to give a brief presentation every month, the community has way too much knowledge and energy for just one guy to be sharing. Whether you're working on something cool, have dev-related challenges, need feedback on business ideas, or want to challenge the status quo, we'd all love to hear it!

And a note on email visibility: Gmail likes to categorize Meetup messages as Promotions. If you happen to see this message (or one like it) in your Promotions tab, click and drag it over to your inbox. Gmail will ask you if you'd like future messages to be treated the same way. Answer in the affirmative, and you should be good to go.

If you'd like to tap into the discussion of a new local crypto discussion group, email michael@denverbitcoincenter.com.

Dan Magnie also reminded us on Thursday that Colorado has become the latest state to attempt to speed up the process for ordinary residents to invest in a private start-up company.

2015-02-25 23:25:47;Little bit of futurism... (green finance, executable contracts, the question of value etc.);"I'm a big believer in using carbon trading and similar derivatives as ways of efficient resource allocation. This should be valid for any kind of resource that we want to take out of the environment. 

Batteries for example. They contain toxic chemicals that should not be discarded, yet knowing how to discard them is hard and usually there aren't ways of recycling them available. But what if all companies who extracted or produced those chemicals had to ""buy"" toxic credits and the only people who could generate them were companies who were able to neutralize them?

Suddenly you create a market value for acquiring the toxic trash.  The beauty of the market is that just electricity or air currents, it always finds the shortest paths between low and high zones: companies who used the chemicals would have incentive to create buy back programs in order to recycle and reduce the cost of the next batch, entrepreneurs who could figure out how to better take the trash from people's hand would have a reward. The price of the trash would be passed around down to be paid ultimately by those who were not recycling or disposing of it completely. 

This is where I'm in disagreement with most of the my eco friendly socialist friends: I believe in the power of capitalism to save the planet with very little regulation of industry. 

This is also where I disagree with most die hard libertarians: I still believe there's a place for government to regulate end points, in this example the producers and recyclers of trash, to create artificial costs of pollution, while leaving the market to figure out the solutions. 


> could we finally build a system which models value directly, rather than abstracting it out to simple numbers? Could we compute the true value of nature, and of a contract, and thereby right the world?

There's no such thing as ""true value"". Value is subjective[1] and only exists inside human minds. Any attempt to make an objective measure of value suffers from the mind projection fallacy[2].

The closest approximation to what you want is a global, continuous, real-time marketplace with some sane governance model for natural resource consumption.

The same counterarguments apply (i.e. if we only permitted technology if it ""lifts all boats identically"" we'd still be living in caves and hunting with spears.)The most important thing to keep in mind is that technology is just a tool. How we use it is up to us. If we're just using technology to make ourselves rich then what's the point? 

Decentralization is potentially civilization changing technology that can be used to help all people, IF we're paying attention. Both capitalism and state governments have some major centralized power flaws with corruption and exploitation that can be addressed by this new generation of tech.

2015-03-05 17:13:57;DApp store. What is it and why do we need it?;"A Ðapp is not a contract, as a single Ðapp can use multiple contracts. In Mist case, a Ðapp will be a bunch of files used to define a interface using web technology: html, js, css, images etc. These can reference one or more contracts in the blockchain.

The Ðapp will be acesses by a smarm hash, that will allow you to find and download the necessary files just like bitTorrent. Those hashes can be made into human readable names using name reg, our ""dns"" contract.

The Ðapp catalog (I prefer this term as it's neither selling nor fully comprehensive) will be a guide, curated by the ethereum team, of Ðapps we suggest to our users as a beginners guide. You will be, of course, free to access any other not on the catalog, given that you know it's name or hash.One important feature of the DApp should be to verify the checksum of the js,html etc.  If it didn't you could be lured into auto sending ether if you somehow navigated to a malicious web page.DApps will come in both forms depending on use-case.

In scenario 1. a piece of software you download, that is more like an executable you run from your desktop to play a game like Minecraft or Eve Online. Perhaps the DApp uses Ethereum for account registration, Leader Boards, Auction Houses and in-game currency management.

So when you are downloading a >1GB DApp, it's probably packed with lots of images, cutscenes, ingame graphics, etc. and that is why it doesn't make sense to run it inside the Mist browser.

Forgive me here, because I don't develop Web Apps, so my knowledge is a bit sparse here, but typically a web-app/website is downloaded *every time you open it*, though it may *cache* some resources temporarily (until you delete temporary internet files for example). So scenario 2 is useful because you definitely don't want to download a 1gb webpage every single time, considering the content is *mostly* static and usually only a few megabytes.

The DApp Store, is useful in and of itself because it can be trusted^1, assist with pushing updates to users from developers in a consistent manor, maintain software ratings/rankings/comments, make similar app suggestions/recomendations, and perhaps even assist with bug reporting...

^1 Even a DApp can be malicious. You want to be sure that someone else has vetted the code, if you cannot do that yourself; which will be the case for most users. You want to ensure they have a policy for removing malicious DApps from the store and warning users that downloaded it previously. Trust is built over time, so a popular store and an older store, is generally safer than a newer/smaller store and often safer than a direct download from the developer's site."
2015-03-05 10:40:12;Noobie Question: What would happen if the price of ETH increase signifficantly ?;"Transactions don't cost ether, they have a fixed cost in ""gas"", a unit that measures their computational costs. There is a market mechanism where users and miners choose a gas price that is paid in ether, so that the cost of computation is not tied to ether speculation.You simply buy Gas with Ether and then pay for contract execution with Gas. If the price of Ether goes up, the cost of Gas goes down.

If, however, the cost of Ether remains the same and the cost of computation increases... then the price of Gas increases. But it is more likely that the cost of computation will go down over time (better/more efficient computers, and Ethereum scalability improvements).That's exactly what the gasprice is for.I think they would say that would be just fine ), as Ether is highly divisible, with I think the smallest denomination being a wei, which is teensy tiny

2015-03-05 06:56:18;Optimizing Inefficiencies;"Corruption and misappropriation of funds. In Ethereum every cent spent is accounted for and can only be moved if it's authorised by the right parties, so this mean an organization can get rid of any unwanted costs of money that goes ""puff"" and disappear. This means that if an organization loses 5%-10% of their revenue by these money leaks, using ethereum becomes profitable even if it's expensive.eBay and AirBnb take a substantial cut of every transaction (7%? 10%?), far larger than is likely to be taken by a dApp on Ethereum, even with escrow charges, exchange fees and whatever other transactional security / mediation practices might be required in the dApp economy.

Being able to undercut eBay or AirBnB prices by 10% *and still make a profit* is a mighty strong incentive - those are big, big pots of money that somebody could, potentially, be dis-intermediating. And this is all the way through industries: brokers are horribly expensive and inefficient, and we should eat all of them if we can!"
2015-03-05 04:28:10;Whisper: Explain to me like i'm 5.;"Let's say Sally likes Billy and she wants to give Billy a secret note in their classroom. Since Sally is scared that the other children, besides Billy, will read the note, she writes it in a very special silly language that only Billy knows. But Sally's even more scared than that: She really doesn't want anyone to know that she likes Billy and just knowing that Sally is passing notes to Billy is enough for them to guess. She also knows that as the note is passed from desk to desk some mean kids might bring it to the teacher. She doesn't want the teacher to know she's even passing a note, or anyone to know that her note is for Billy.

It turns out lots of boys and girls want to pass notes and they are all scared about different things. Some don't care if the other children know who they are passing notes to, or if the teacher can read it. Instead they are mostly scared that the note will take too long to get to the girl or boy that they like. Others can wait a long time if they don't have to be scared at all that anyone will know who they like. Nobody knows who the mean kids are but they are all pretty sure that a mean kid might end up with a note at some point.

At recess they have a meeting and Sally explains a new way of passing notes. Instead of having a boy or girls name on it, each note has the name of a different magical animal that they invented. The notes are written in a silly language that only the person who invented that animal can read. Instead of sending a note directly to a friend, notes are passed randomly around from desk to desk. Often instead of just passing a note the child will copy it, so that they can keep one note in their desk and pass the other one. Most girls and boys, most of the time, will have lots of different notes in their desk. Any boy or girl can ask the kids at the desks next to theirs what animal names are on the notes in their desk and if the other child has one that they want, they make sure to pass it or copy it over. Of course you can still write someones name on a note, if you want to get it to them fast and you don't care so much about mean kids or the teacher.

With so many notes floating around, Sally's secret note is likely to end up near Billy's desk. Since Billy is looking for the secret magical animal name that only he knows, he eventually finds Sally's note and learns the secret.Ohh me too me too!!

My take-away - these topics keep coming up in conversations that reach out to a wider audience:

1) Public versus Private blockchains

2) Multiple blockchains talking to each other

3) Decentralised Identity systems

4) Decentralised Reputation systems


These lead to the following questions...


1) Ethereum as currently configured is aiming to be a (the?) public ledger IMO - what does that mean for privacy? Does it need to worry about it? Are privacy needs not served by private blockchains?

2) Should the Ethereum project be building an Ethereum compatible multi-blockchain infrastructure for 2.0?

3) Would it be of beneficial impact (for economy, freedom, choice) to remove control (and potential misuse) of identities from large corporations like facebook/amazon/ebay/google etc? from governments etc from criminals etc? where this power has now centralised?

4) Is it within the remit of the Ethereum project to tackle these issues head on?


The most interesting thing about blockchains for me is that they are an immutable store of relationships - which can be agreed upon by the participating parties - who all play a part in the validation.

I see everyone and everything - people, things, groups, corporations, nations, etc having it's own blockchain one day. As I am ultimately defined by all my relationships - a hash of my personal blockchain could be a definition of my unique identity. 

We link to transactions in other (peoples/things) blockchains by means of our unique identity - a hash of our blockchain.

As my identity changes thanks to my interactions, so does the hash of my blockchain - only my blockchain can link all these hash identities together. I can explicitly choose to share/not share different levels of my data with anyone, with explicit arrangements of how it can be used by them and for what purpose codified into our agreement.

At one stroke, we go a long way towards solving the problems of unique identities, reputation, how to measure value and privacy - imagine a world where it would be 'illegal' for anyone or anything to use 'your data' unless it was uniquely signed by you - each time of use!

It's like the old economic argument about fast food restaurants: the reason why they all locate themselves close to each other is that they're cooperating by giving each other network effect even more than they are competing.It's really good for ethereum. If using EVM compatible block chains becomes commonplace for companies then the skills they learn using them will make them much more likely to also use the primary ethereum block chain.

Seriously, having clones and alt chains is extremely good for ethereum or any block chain for that matter - I really hope the community will not fall into the mentality of shitcoin hate that the bitcoin cult has decided to adopt.I should plug [Qointum](https://qointum.com), similar to Eris it's a multichain smart contract platform, however it is also a web 3.0 cryptocurrency like Ethereum and we're using the Python VM instead to build our shared-state turing machine so that app developers can use their existing skills and libraries. We're also providing quantum security and a new DPoS model out of the box (written in C++ for speed), however as the platform matures each chain will be able to customize its own cryptographic security and consensus model.

We're starting our crowdfunding soon, so come check us out - /r/qointum"
2015-03-26 21:59:58;Introducing eDollar, the ultimate stablecoin built on Ethereum;"Hmm, this actually looks exactly like the version of schellingcoin that I came up with during discussions with Dominic Williams (the specific discovery being requiring the margin-caller to supply and destroy the stablecoin as a primary mechanism for keeping total stablecoin supply at zero rather than interest rate targeting as per my original design). So, two groups discovered it independently in identical form modulo parameters (we did 200/125%), which is a pretty good heuristic for it being at least pretty good :)

> Maker can upgrade its own guardian contract, and update vital parameters of the eDollar contract (such as changing the source of price feeds, or changing collateral requirements). To prevent abuse these actions have to be primed with a delay (which can be several months for extremely vital functions), so that users will be able to notice and withdraw their funds from the contract if this power is being misused.

Now this I am interested in. This sounds like something that really should be built as a separate plug-and-play component for any application; now that I think about it, quasi-centralized apps with ""constitutions"" guaranteeing _slowness_ of feature changes are likely to be a rather attractive point on the decentralization/adaptability tradeoff space.I know it's early and you still need to add etherex support as well. Just fyi on some Solidity optimizations. You can declare public variables now, so you don't need to craft your own getter functions. Also, checking if msg.sender == guardian could be neater with modifier functions. Inline initialisations are also possible (so no need to set the variables in the constructor anymore) :). 

Will check through this later properly! Sounds exciting.

EDIT: The delay on contract upgrades is novel. I like that!Cool stuff! Not a bad start (bonus points for the solidity code). I'll pick on the riskiest part, as an armchair economist (forgive me, please).

> This means that becoming a Liquidity Partner is an easy way to make a guaranteed profit for anyone with capital available, since they earn income both from the spread of their market making activities

No such thing as guaranteed profit (with the exception of arbitrage, or trading on inside information, or broker commission, stuff like that). Market-making is only profitable if the marker-maker avoids what they call ""adverse selection"" (in layman's terms, getting run over by a truck, while trying to pick up pennies in front of a bulldozer).

> Cryptohedge and Maker will ensure there is enough liquidity available for Shapeshift to always offer its services at a spread below 1% and with limits of at least 5 BTC per transaction.

If the ETH price is falling, then the net order flow will be negative, which means way more more sells than buys (ie. sells of ETH, or buys of eDollar). If the spread stays at 1%, and the Maker (or Liquidity Partner) is buying all the way down, then they will rapidly run out of cash (ie. the inventory becomes unbalanced. holding lots of ETH, but no USD/eDollar). That's why spreads get wide when the price is volatile, its not profitable to keep buying near the mid-price when people are dumping. You'll go broke (unless you have enough funds to buy all the ETH).

If you don't have enough funds to buy all the ETH, then as long as the price is going sideways, and net order flow is more-or-less balanced, a simple 1% spread rule should work fine.We've been linked to by most major coin communities. I've seen this posted in multiple spots in the NXT, Bitshares, and Supernet communities. This thread is getting a lot of attention.This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.

I realize this is probably not important but why 0.99 and not 1.00? Might be silly but for me I feel an asset that's is worth about USD$1.001 *feels* more like a dollar than one worth USD$0.999When I spend the eDollars, do I still need to use ethers to pay for the transaction fees or I can use the eDollars to pay for the transaction fees?Is this a function of Ehtereum and users can build their own customized pegged currencies by themselves?Great post. But I really don't get the whole burning thing. Why all the rules that if the price is X this will happen, and if price is Y that will happen? Why not create a sort of ETF with 100.000 dollar worth of ETH and at the same time sell CDF-contract's with the same underlying value. This is how it's done on the professional markets. Like, 2000 oracles sent the price to a contract every 10 blocks. The CFD will fix the differences created. So if the price goes down 1% the CFD will make 1000 profit. On no professional markets any dollars are burnt ever before. It's like re-inventing the wheel. A big company would just buy 100.000 dollar worth of oil and sell Future contracts to cover the whole thing. 
 Would it be easy to duplicate this for other currencies? eEUR, eCNY, eGBP, eCHF, eBTC...Will the eDollar earn a yield similar to bitUSD?Just wanted to make sure you saw this conversation, and my comment:

I think a pegged coin would be a real game changer and look forward to seeing eDollar in action.How is this different from /r/NuBits which is open source and already stable for over six months? @rune: A question for you.

Assume 

1. You create this stablecoin scheme on Ethereum main-net when it launches.

2. The contract is structured so that part of ETH received by contract through staking gets funnelled out to your address. This is your monetisation scheme.

3. You have actually figured out the best arrangement i.e. there really isn't another stablecoin approach that offers a large improvement over this.

Question:

1. What is your competitive edge and how do you maximize it?

2. Stated differently, I make the same scheme but with my address as the scheme beneficiary. What makes it hard for my scheme to take away your business?what is the status on this now?  Ready to go live?"

2015-04-02 23:16:37;[March 2015] On Stake and Consensus;"It's a little early for me, so I am not going to fully articulate my arguments against the above paper but here are some of them as bullet points, they can be expanded upon request :D

&nbsp;

Section 2 is way too short. Where is the discussion of other consensus systems? Computer Science research in this field starts in the 80s. Voting systems have been formally studied since the 1700s.

&nbsp;

Why is [Bac02] cited but not:
[Pricing via processing or combatting junk mail](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3632491171407843130) 

&nbsp;

FLP is cited, but DLS is not, oops.
[Consensus in the presence of partial synchrony](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16245621730371199775)

&nbsp;

I don't understand how you can write against PoS and there is no mention of Leslie Lamport, it's almost as if the person writing this hasn't actually studied distributed systems. Here are some of his greatest hits:&nbsp;

[The part-time parliament](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15102173899612517840)
&nbsp;

[Time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4892527405117123487)
&nbsp;

It would be nice if someone wrote an implementation of his [Leaderless Byzantine Paxos](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=leaderless+paxos) algorithm, I haven't been able to find one.

&nbsp;

3.4 implies that vector clocks don't exist, oops:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock

&nbsp;

It also implies that a number of Goolge databases are impossible:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanner_%28database%29

&nbsp;

It would also be nice if this author had put in the work to do an apples to apples comparison between a legitimate PoS system and bitcoin. I recommend they look more seriously at Tendermint. 

&nbsp;

This paper also seems to ignore that Trust can be fluid and it's extremely expensive to assume that everyone is anonymous when really no entity on the internet is anonymous. This faulty modeling of Trust and Identity is maybe the most offensive thing in *On Stake and Consensus*; it implies that consensus between truly anonymous entities has some meaning, which I think we can all see is a logically dubious assertion. A simple example is truly anonymous entities can all have a single identity or multiple identities as is the case in a Sybil Attack.To quote the paper: ""If this is implemented correctly, there is no problem with this, except that it changes the trust model from that of Bitcoin."" Indeed it does. But it might be more prudent to rather say that it is more honest about its trust model than bitcoin. And as others have pointed out, it's as if bitcoin has over optimized its trust model into something that is for all intents and purposes useless unless you write your own operating system and bitcoin client, and while we're at it develop your own hardware

How's this for a theorem:

""Any distributed consensus algorithm ever uses social consensus 
as a fallback mechanism because software bugs will always exist""


... even bitcoin (eg. March 2013 berkleydb vs leveldb fiasco). At least with a modern PoS system, there is explicit impetus to develop that social consensus fallback as its necessary every time a new node joins the network. So its much more explicitly honest about what it is, and doesn't pretend to be something it's not, the way bitcoin pretends to be decentralized consensus when in reality its like 3 guys controlling most of the hash power. At least with PoS it'll probably be more like 15.Paging /u/vbuterin, [who wrote](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack/):

One problem that I see is that it maps pretty closely to the old-style bitshares market peg: if the value of S drops to $0.99, then you have the incentive to convert V to S because you expect V to go to $1 as a result of other people following the same strategy and thus will earn a profit. So it has the same fault: if the value of S starts dropping too much, then everyone has the incentive to sell their S to get out while they still can, and so the value of S will drop further. On further thinking I actually believe that it's the very separation between price voting and buying and selling that makes schellingcoin work.So, a schellingcoin merged in with the seignorage shares conversion process in a single step?

Also, cryptocurrency trumps precious metals. Hard. disclaimer: I don't know stuff about this stuff. I am speaking out of ignorance.

re:
1:
(**Note**: I may be misunderstanding, and as such unintentionally misrepresenting, your point here)
While I do think this would be good, I don't think it is necessary for *every* household to have one. It may be sufficient to have one in every few households have one, and have friendly neighborhood trade and local shops provide the others? Also, I'm skeptical that making quality chips will be affordable to the average household, because they would not be making them at scale. In any case, some amount of transportation of goods is necessary because one needs to obtain the raw materials. Unless all the materials one uses are entirely and efficiently recyclable, well, not everyone can own a mine. Specialization of skills is useful! While it would be best for there to be a large number of suppliers for materials and other goods, I think it is not practical to *completely* decentralize every business/trade. I think that while as many things as feasible probably should have a decentralized option, for many people it will be worth it to purchase goods (final products) from somewhat more centralized sources. So long as there is a sufficiently mainstream decentralized version, the existence of the decentralized version should prevent the slightly more centralized version from causing as much harm.

2:
yeah, if this could be done efficiently that would be nice.
But I'm not sure how efficiently this can be done on a large scale?
I'm not sure how one could create long range high bandwidth connections without having an actual long connection or satellites, and I'm not sure how that would happen without a large amount of funds. It could be done by donation, but uh, theres only so much will to create connections like that, that I'm not sure one can expect people to keep them decentralized for long periods of time.
But yes, more research on mesh-nets, good to get them to work as well as they can. I'm just not sure how efficient they can be over continent scale connections. Hopefully somewhat.

3:
Yes, user adoption of this would be great.
In addition to the number of people making transactions, it is important I think that there be connected closed loops of payments (the pencil maker buys wood from the wood group, and paint from the paint group, the wood group buys pencils from the pencil maker for marking measurements on wood, the paint makers buy pencils to use on their notes, etc.)
But uh, this is all fairly redundant stuff that everyone already is aware of, so not much point in my having repeated it.

4:
I'm not as sure about this one. The eBurger/eBigMac idea seems to me that it would work well for a store of value? (if the network doesn't have a problem anyway) Also I feel that speculation on precious metals may cause it to be too expensive to use them for something which might be more useful in some cases? Not sure. You've thought more about this than I have (likely on the other things too), so take what I'm saying with a packet of salt?

5:
I'm not sure this actually means much.
I may be uh, over-fitting (?), but to me this brings to mind complaints like ""Americans are f***** sheep"", which does not seem like a useful complaint to me.
It is probably true that people could stand to choose to peruse and be influenced by different distributions of types of media than they do, but when has this ever not been the case?
One cannot expect everyone to be aware of every issue.
Though, for decentralization to occur, it seems likely that more people need to be aware of the idea and ideologies related to it (though they don't necessarily need to particularly support the ideologies, so long as they can tell that it would benefit the ideals they do have?)

2015-04-09 01:44:04;[Metaphor] Ethereum puts time into computing;"I enjoy this metaphor and have been thinking in similar lines. We can already conceive of building the state logic of alternate realities onto Ethereum (decentralized law, governance and property in a virtual world for example). With the current scalability, we still have to ""resort"" to our current reality to host things like files and so forth.

However, it won't be that farfetched to imagine that somewhere into the future, as we invent ultra-scalable blockchain consensus systems, that much more will be absorbed into this. It sounds very sci-fi, but we might just be actually busy inventing new realities, new substrates.

Somewhere in the future we might have planck time blocks, with data stored in DNA, and quantum tunnelling used for block propagation. Something like that. ;)

Either way it remains an interesting thought experiment. What if our current reality is a blockchain from a previous reality? Maybe that would explain the quick expansion in the early days... the coin-dev didn't have a proper difficulty retargeting algo?

A relay will exist in Frontier release.  It's pretty much done and it's deployment is being tested on testnet.

Second part is an exchange contract (a sample is in the btcrelay repo you already linked to).

The initial system is simple.  With the relay, you provide it a Bitcoin transaction (and its merkle proof) and an Ethereum contract's address.  The relay verifies that the Bitcoin transaction is legit and ""relays"" it to the Ethereum contract.  For a simple exchange, the contract basically says ""send X ether to address A if Y bitcoins have been sent to address B"".  https://github.com/ethers/btcToEther is what one can use to construct this Bitcoin transaction.  There is a frontend that will simply ask you for the hash of the Bitcoin transaction, and then submit it to the relay.  (The frontend is the client directory of the btcrelay repo.)

Note that the relay's primary purpose isn't exchange.  The relays allows any other Ethereum contract to take action based on a Bitcoin transaction, with the assurance that that Bitcoin transaction has been sufficiently confirmed and is on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The relay is fully trustless and depend only on the security of Bitcoin and Ethereum.  It is a building block that other systems and Dapps can leverage.

2015-04-16 03:49:13;Why is scalability such a hard issue;">  In the discussions I have seen lately it seems as if we are substituting system complexity as a cost trade-off to acquire security. 

More precisely, it's system complexity as a cost trade-off to acquire developer simplicity. With your approach, developers are forced to think ""okay, this is a payment, I need a lightning network for this - oh wait, the payment is made by a DAO so the lightning network won't quite work because there's no entity that can hold a secret so I need to go talk to a secret share, then I need a complex multiheuristic reputation system (which by the way will end up more complex than our entire proposal) in order to figure out when DAOs are under attack, etc"". We're targeting, basically, being maximally close to equivalent to 1.0 from a developer PoV; it's all just function calls. Ethereum has been about pushing abstraction and application-neutrality to extremes from day one anyway, so not much of a departure imo."

Bitcoin was the first example, and Ethereum's probably the best one I've seen so far. It boils down to writing some piece of open source software that allows people (or software agents) to collectively address some need while receiving remuneration directly, usually via the same software.

Open source software development models might also be useful to you.https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/""DAO"" was a modification of the term ""DAC"" invented a few weeks prior by the founder of bitshares - just to point out where to continue research. BTS and several related projects are ""for-profit DAOs"".

You could probably say NXT is also a DAO, but that's about it.

Ethereum prefers to be seen as a ""DAO platform"" and there are quite a few in production."

2015-04-29 05:47:59;Newbie Questions About Ethereum...here we go...;"See Gav's blockchain scaling piece https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/ 

Decentralization, and speed. It's quite a complex piece, but it's quite a complex problem! 

TL;DR ""more magic"" is the solution.And, for even more https://github.com/vbuterin/scalability_paper/blob/master/scalability.pdf the new whitepaper.

I have not understood this material well enough to describe it clearly - sorry I can't provide an effective summary yet.I've been working my way through Vitalik's paper, can't say I have a complete understanding but here is a stab at it. Security deposits are the main concept that makes the whole thing work. Multiple blockchains are mined in parrallel but they are connected in such a way that they must interact and verify one another. In order to mine one parrallel chain a miner must risk a substantial security deposit in relation to the rest of the blockchains. Basically what you might say is that even though there may be an incentive for huge mining operations (let's expand mining to include, providing offchain storage and processing that is incentivized and verified by blockchain transactions) there is no way for them to control an entire blockchain because, in the case of the newer work, they are still risking their security deposit relative to the whole network. Anyone can challenge that security deposit by proving that a miner is creating invalid blocks and the rest of the mining community can verify the challenge, take away the misbehaving miners security deposit, and banish the bad block. In theory everyone is incentivized to do this work.

This is perhaps an oversimplification. But the general idea is that while different pools of miners work on different chains, there is an incentive to police each other, so collectively the different chains form one chain. The hypercube idea is basically just the shape of the connections between the chains, so as the cube adds more dimensions, each point on the cube gets an extra edge. So for example if the network goes from a 8 dimensional cube to a 9 dimensional cube it would double it's capacity from 256 chain fibers to 512 while only requiring individual nodes to police one extra connection between chain fibers.

Please correct me if I'm wrong on some aspect of this.

This is of course super complicated, which is why I'm a shill for [Intheoreum](http://intheoreum.org), which Vitalik was forced to agree is simpler and therefore better. Once Intheoreum get's to it's ""Firefly"" epoch you'll be sorry you didn't specuvest while you still could.Thank you for the replies.There are a few older blogposts that Vitalik wrote that also cover blockchain scalability. Not sure how relevant they are in terms of his current plans - blockchain science & innovation moves so quickly even work from last November may not be considered cutting edge!
I guess consider this as further reading :)
https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/

https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/21/scalability-part-2-hypercubes/

https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/13/scalability-part-3-metacoin-history-multichain/>however, how can one node (one computer/device) store all the world's decentralized internet (or Internet of Things) if it becomes as huge as its intended to be?

It likely won't work like that. There are multi-chain models that are likely more efficient. 

>If the blockchain data is split up and nodes DON'T hold all, but only part, of the data, then destroying a few nodes could permanently destroy blockchain data, couldn't it?

It would not be arbitrarily divided.

Maybe. 


>how is that different from the centralization we have now?

You have proposed only one possible scenario, and it will likely be different.

2015-04-28 13:25:38;What is going on with Ethercoin?;"Just a disclaimer for those who don't know: Ethercoin is not ether and is not affiliated with any of the ethereum developers. It's a coin that **promises** to trade back into ether when the live network goes live, a sort of market speculation pre-release. If you buy that you are trusting them to fill their part of the bargainFrontier milestone reached 91% yesterday (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestones). Maybe that has something to do with it?

Just a personal guessEthercoin is someone who bought 1 million ether during the presale...they then created a simple Proof of Stake coin called ""ethercoin""....on their website they have legitimate wallet addresses that prove they _do have 1 million real ether_.

**but** just BC they have real addresses _doesn't_ promise that they will exchange ethercoin 1:1 for ether when it's released.

I'm guessing that ppl at the NYC Bitcoin conference are really excited about Augur and ethereum, and they're taking a gamble via buying ethercoin.

I really hope ethercoin is legit BC it would be really unfortunate for the naive buyers of ethercoin, _and_ it would also be unfortunate for ethereum (even though they have _nothing_ to do with it; sort of how MtGox was not synonymous with Bitcoin).

Even if the ethercoin ppl had good, true intentions going into it, let's say for example, real ether starts trading at $5 apiece..._then_ the incentives of the ethercoin devs will change dramatically - they'll now say ""holy shit, we now have $5 million dollars in our hands, maybe we'll keep it and relocate to Thailand"" (or wherever crooks run away to...lol)

Those wallets could be flagged, but either way, it would be a bad situation...let's just hope that it's legit :)We don't have any control over who is buying and selling Ethercoins on exchanges, so we can only speculate.

As for the discussion regarding trust for us to deliver Ethers, we'd like to make it clear that we support Escrow transactions with Bitrated.   Infact, we would rather everyone make purchases with escrow if possible.

We have been using the top-rated agents on the site for trades.   Please see bitrated.com to see how the escrow works, and contact us at ethercoin.cc@outlook.com if you are interested in buyingPlease consider using r/ethertrader for price discussion."

Ditto for my stuff.

...can you explain why the ""end"" case for your situation couldn't just have a magic value, like myItem.next=0?

(Not that I'm disagreeing with you about how nice it would be to have union types, I just can't see right away why it's a ""need"" instead of a ""nice to have"")Solidity is quite different from Haskell in that it is a more low-level language with static memory allocation and non-polymorphic types (except for contracts). Adding polymorphic types in the way you propose seems doable, but I guess you would still need to do the allocation yourself. We will hopefully have more flexibility soon with templated data structures and shared code, but I will keep your suggestion in mind."

Two days ago mined around 40 blocks a day.
Today I mined a few blocks.
Tomorrow...

Apart from experiments with contracts I am benchmarking GPU mining. Not yet sure if it is functional. CPP-ethereum is the only one supporting GPU atm but setting it up takes some stamina and nerves.This is why I've been a strong advocate of PoS as soon as possible!  So many CPU miners had ""pie in the sky"" visions of ""making it rain"", and I knew they'd become frustrated very quickly....


It's simply how Nature works - [Pareto's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)...which says:  ""about 10% of the miners will mine about 90% of the blocks""....

It wouldn't be uncommon for 5% to mine 95%...

...or 2% of the miners to mine 98% of the blocks.

i.e.  Proof of Waste marathon competition.Ctrl-C

sudo poweroffWell, with ~5-9 uncles per 25 blocks you could probably lower that estimate by around uh, a factor of 1.2-1.4.

Also, uh, iirc, admin.miner.hashrate() currently gives the result in kH/s, not H/s as the docs say?

I may be mistaken about this, but I think that is what I heard.

So, if I am correct about all this, then it would be

    function mineTimeEstimate(){//outputs to console.log estimated time to mine in Hours Mins Seconds. Returns estimted time in seconds.
    adjustedHashRate=admin.miner.hashrate()*1000*1.04;//1000 is to fix an error. 1.08 is assuming at least 2 uncles every 25 blocks.
    //Remove the factor of 1000 once this issue has been fixed in the version of geth which you are using.
    estimatedSeconds=eth.getBlock(""latest"").difficulty/adjustedHashRate;
    console.log(Math.floor(estimatedSeconds/3600.)+"" Hours, ""+Math.floor((estimatedSeconds%3600)/60)+"" Minutes, ""+Math.floor(estimatedSeconds%60)+"" Seconds, estimated until next successful mining."");
    return estimatedSeconds;
    }


So, I think your estimated time till mining would be between 1 and 1.4 hours?
(and mine would be ~6 hours)

idk, seems reasonable enough to me.

2015-05-21 13:24:32;Confirmations question;"My impression is, thinking about ""confirmations"" is the wrong way to look at it... All that matters is how many hashes have been attempted in a certain time frame and what the probability is that a large number of those hashes are under the control of a single entity. Confirmations give you some indication of this fact, but only incomplete information.

Bitcoin at a confirmation every 10 minutes is a lot more secure than Litecoin at a confirmation every 1 minute, even if you wait for 10 minutes' worth of confirmations on litecoin.

However, confirmations tend to be exponential (based on the rules above), so there's a number K where a single confirmation set the odds of a fork at 1/K, but two confimations set the odds of a fork at 1/K^2 etc.

So to answer your original question, ""the relationship between risk/total minning power needed and number of confirmations"" is a very complicated relationship that's hard to pin down, because we'll likely never know how many of the miners are owned by a single person.

As a rule of thumb though, if I was buying a house with Bitcoin I would wait an hour (6 confirmations) and with ethereum I would still wait an hour (300 confirmations) if not longer."

Once Frontier is live it's possible that there are some exchanges that will trade ether on day 1. I've mentioned yunbi.com before as an exchange that might be looking to support ether. Emax.io is another ether exchange, but it won't open until Homestead (at least 1 month after launch).

If you want to be able to sell ether right at launch, the best bet is probably to try to do it OTC directly with a buyer since you will not rely on an exchange to get the system to work - you will need to be comfortable using a command line interface to do this however. 

[Maker OTC](http://forum.makerdao.com/c/Maker-OTC) was created exactly for the purpose of getting ether trade and volume going right away since I've been contacted by several ether holders who want to sell out some of their stash at launch. You could make a post on the forum and see if you can find any possible buyer who's willing to pay you BTC once the network is live. The trades can be done using bitrated escrow to make them fast and secure.There is a cryptocurrency that is apparently backed by 1 million Ether at a 1 for 1 backing and is [currently trading at 71 cents](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethercoin/) I think this is a reasonable estimate of the market value of Ether discounted for counter party risks.

2015-06-04 17:16:13;Are Ethereum's Block times better than Bitcoin's?;"> ""Block times could be any number, it's just a couple of changes to the source code""

False. The ""R&D mission and laboratory work"" involved in making 12s blocks viable was [described here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/), and the results of that work are doing an imo very good job reducing the centralization risk of ultrafast blocks by ~85%.

> Isn't going to fork very often

Okay, fine, under normal conditions bitcoin blocks are 98% likely to be final but ethereum blocks are 80% likely to be final. However, six bitcoin blocks provide a one minus one in a billion finality guarantee (since 0.02 ** 6 < 10^-9) and 13 ethereum blocks provide that same guarantee (0.2 ** 13 < 10^-9), so it's still the case that what bitcoin provides in 60 minutes, ethereum provides in 156 seconds. Sure, not in six blocks, but it's a battle of linear versus exponential, so the more fine-grained you can make the single-block confirmation time the better.

If you plot a curve of ""level of certainty"" to ""time"", you'll find that the faster blockchain's graph is going to have a higher expected level of certainty after any time interval in part because of the mat above. If there is substantial need for, I may write another blog post explaining/showing this further.

Different use cases require different solutions and there is plenty of space for Ethereum, Counterparty, MaidSafe, and of course Bitcoin!AFAIK, Ethereum shorter block times are not equivalent to litecoin, and are mostly a result of implementing the GHOST protocol (which was proposed to bitcoin initially), which has incentives for people who find stale forks to go back to the main fork asap and claim rewards. 

Bitcoin 10 minutes block times are great for safely and securely trading bitcoins around the world, but the purpose of ethereum is to be a quick and responsive computer, so it needs shorter block times.LOL https://twitter.com/derosetech/status/606909252251164672"

WOWSo when Vitalik takes the high road and doesn't reply to this nonsense, can I buy them, but if he's disillusioned I'll offer a lower price.

Have you thought about the value Ethereal brings to application developers?  If you're such a scientist, I suggest you start there.  I'm building an app on it, and mining to fuel said app, and I believe in the potential and see it working perfectly for days at a time.  

Forks happen, bugs happen, consensus issues happen, it's pre-beta.  What they are doing is exponentially harder than using the simple SHA256 algorithm used in BTC with the 10 minute block times.  It's not perfect yet, but it works, and I trust it more than the systems it will replace.  Troll on you crazy diamond, troll on. 


It's time for you to be banned. Please, feel free to continue with your foolishness, but do it elsewhere.Right, c'mon guys. Please.

Hi guys.

So let's separate these issues out into three piles, please.

1) We've got a couple of seriously disgruntled ex-employees who are having a serious go at us.

2) We've got bad news coming about the post-Olympic development schedule, because we found quite a few tough bugs during Olympic, and it taught us some real lessons about getting consensus code to full robustness.

3) We've got a complex corporate structure with entities in various locales, and people want more transparency about finances.

Now, this might be a dumb thing to say, but let me say it: Reddit is not the best place to handle these issues. What you need is a couple of substantial, clear, official blog posts on these issues which leave people with clear statements of intent from Ethereum, in an official sense: words you can stand by, rather than various members of staff popping up here and trying to sort out items piecemeal.

I'm working on a couple of blog posts about this all right now. I'm not sure they'll answer all the questions, but they'll make a good start.

I don't think the tone of these discussions is at all appropriate. We're good people trying to do the right thing. Please relax a little and let's take this a piece at a time, ok?

boy, am I glad I didn't 'invest'! I remember reading those conditions and thinking, that sounds more like I'd be donating money than investing in anything. Also remember watching a video which Vitalik was using an example of creating a coin, that people could buy if they were interested in donating to mathematical research and thinking, oh oh!

I do feel sympathy though, for those who did participate in the crowd fund. Also feel sorry for anyone thinking of doing crowdfunds in the future!Furthermore,  every single person who purchased ether agreed to the following:


**Section 10**
By clicking the checkbox, the Purchaser consents and
agrees to the Terms and the Ether Product Purchase Agreement;.....
(v) represents and warrants that Purchaser **is not exchanging bitcoin (BTC) for ETH for the purpose of speculative investment;**

19.8 Risk that the Ethereum Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of Purchaser

19.9 Risk that the Ethereum Platform May Never be Completed or Released


It's borderline infuriating to see trolls have the nerve to come here and troll away.  The developers are working very hard to make sure the network is secure.  They will not be intimidated into releasing software before it is ready; a hard fork with live ether of real value would be 1000x worse then a delayed launch.

All trolls who say anything contrary to the terms of sale should be ignored and shadow banned.  MODS PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.TLDR, the point of buying ether was not to make money, but to make applications that use ether and add value to the network, if you don't happen to make money on this investment with no additional work, everyone in the ethereum community is really really sorry.  

Not to say the presale wasn't a requirement to get to this point, but I don't even think it's investors that are trolling.  Somebody with more time on their hands should chart negative social media posts and ethercoin price.  I'm super curious what that at a looks like."

https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethsendtransaction

the transaction object needs to have some properties most of which are optional :
    {from , to, value, gas, gasPrice, data, nonce}

In your case you have the ""from"" and the ""value"" properties of the object ie: 

    {from, value} :: {from: web3.eth.coinbase, value:web3.toWei('2','ether')}

from your code:

    function message() {
			contract = web3.eth.contract('0x642ae5e1e213e15a6a4b3c58a0c6eaac2859440b', contractDesc);
			contract.SetMessage.sendTransaction(document.getElementById('message').value, {from: web3.eth.coinbase, value:web3.toWei('2','ether')});
};


you are leaving some properties blank which in your case defaults to contract creation. if you want to send to a specific contract you can specify the ""to"" property like so

    {from: web3.eth.coinbase, value:web3.toWei('2','ether'), to: ""contractAddress""}

if you want to send data with it also :

    {from: web3.eth.coinbase, value:web3.toWei('2','ether'), to: ""contractAddress"", data:""dataIWantToSend""}

2015-06-18 07:19:38;Don't we need like ... 500tps to be competitive with centralized solutions?;"It's all a case of scalability. 

As the Ethereum research team (Vitalik, Vlad and Gav *et al*) deploys it the fruits of its labour over time, we'll begin to see 2-4 second block times (thanks to Vlad's Casper PoS consensus mechanism) and 115000 tps thanks to some of the ideas outlined in [Vitalik's scalability paper](https://github.com/vbuterin/scalability_paper/blob/master/scalability.pdf). 

It's essentially based on sampling the s validator set to process shards of the space and reverting invalid transactions, 115k tps is available in the quadratic version, were we to utilise the stacking version the number of tps is theoretically unbounded.http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3a2omr/ethereum_scalability/cs8r6g1Actually I personally think the initial figure of 20tps supported by Ethereum is also extremely suspect. 

First of all from stats.ethdev more than 50% of the blocks took more than 10s to propagate. (Please correct me if I interpret this part wrong)This means that assuming the node distribution registered stats.ethdev represents mining node more than 50% of the time some of the miner is not working on the current block, mining stales (uncles) instead of the main chain. This is a waste. Especially since uncle cannot have descendant.

Which brings us to the 2nd part. How many (0-conf,1-conf,2-conf) transactions are actually being dropped? Because starting 0.9.30 we started to implement some form of mempool janitor, some of the 0-conf is not going to propagate. And because some of the miner is not mining on the main chain there surely some of the block declared invalid because it is not in the main chain (2nd gen uncles/cousins). If anyone has any hard figure on the last experiment I would be very grateful if they could share it.>  It seems like one success would crash the network and make everything prohibitively expensive ... 

This is what I have been saying since the early designs have been published: this will never scale, resulting in either extremely expensive fees, or centralizationI understand how great it is to decentralize apps.  If every part of an app could be decentralized on the blockchain that would be fantastic.  But it does come at a cost.  As a layman I call this ""the cost to publish"".  Publishing is not free however its cost can be relatively low so long as the volume of transactions remain within the limitations of the architecture of the network.

With bitcoin you have 1mb block sizes.  With Ethereum we are up against 12 sec block times and network propagation technical hurdles.  Every network has its limitations.  Up to the point of that limitation publishing is of a reasonable cost (again I am not a scalability expert) then once you hit that limitation transactions get prohibitively more expensive for everyone simultaneously.

One way of looking at it, this cost is a fee to discourage excessive publishing which also represents the cost users pay to get their transactions published into a block and get that block propagated across the network.

If you are not a layman and instead you are a blockchain architect then you come up with unique solutions to scalability.  If you can follow Vitalik's work on this subject https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/ that is great.  Most of are limited in our grasp of scalability.

For app developers the most obvious solution is less publishing to create greater ease and convenience for users and a better user experience.  Transactions that take place between coinbase or circle users are faster and easier than transactions that are published on the blockchain.  These centralized services represent counterparty risk but most Ethereum app developers need to have a fair amount of code on a backend server somewhere for their apps to run correctly.  Few apps are simple enough that all of their code is stored on the blockchain itself.

So again this topic is not simple and it has many solutions.  I wouldn't worry about it because there will always be trade offs and balances between decentralized and centralized module architecture of an app running on the Ethereum network.  You might be willing to trust 10 to 20 dollars to a centralized module within a mostly decentralized app if it would mean a better user experience for you.  This module may not publish all of the transactions between all of the users on the blockchain but it may not matter if it allows you to get a ride to the airport conveniently without too much hassle and it does this reliably for several months for several thousand users then what do you care?  If your 10 or 20 dollars is lost because the app lost or stole those funds the utility of centralization was relative to the financial risk that you took.

Anyways 20 people will tell me that I am wrong but from my perspective you simply need to find the right balance between the amount of funds you are entrusting to a service and the level of decentralization in the management of those funds.  People trust changetip with their funds and correct me if I am wrong but it is a mostly centralized service.

For any funds over 100 USD I would expect every transaction to be published.  For any funds under 100 USD I expect there to be a sliding scale in terms of centralization of funds management for certain modules of the app architecture.

Think about it.
I think this is covered in the white paper.  Cost adjusts against supply and demand.The advances come at the end... bare with me :)

Ethereum, in my opinion, and indeed all distributed ledger solutions, are not really going to be able to compete on performance and latency with centralized solutions. 
A few examples from different institution types:

Visa - average of 4-6k tps and peak rates around 10-15k

Mastercard - average of 2-4k tps and peak rates around 5-7k

NYSE - 1M+ tps and peak rates of 2-3M

(There is also a difference between messages per second and transactions per second, and in the case of VISA, Mastercard and multilateral trading facilities like NYSE - settlements per second.)

The point being, distributed ledger technology is great for certain things, but not necessarily for others. Serialization of events for example is easier to do with centralized solutions, and where performance is important, close to impossible to attain with distributed ledgers. - At least without opening the system up to race condition issues and potentially double spending.

When this is said though, the big optimizations this technology will bring to finance include but is not limited to things like: Asynchronous settlement and clearing, transfer of value between unrelated entities, transparency through auditing solutions... These things will bring massive value to the finance industry and in a significant way change the way institutions do business on an every day basis.

Also, remember that transactions per second do not necessarily equal the amount of transaction you can output, with most distributed ledgers one transaction can have many outputs.> It seems like one success would crash the network and make everything prohibitively expensive ...

Don't worry, it's more like there won't be any ""successes"" in the sense of large transaction volume because it will be prohibitively expensive to get there at all!"

**Focus on the customer**

Make sure you get the user experience right first. Building decentralization-ready apps is much faster than building decentralized apps, and by being more agile in the beginning you'll save yourself a lot of work rewriting and rearchitecting.

**Bet on containers**

Build your software with containers in mind. We strongly believe that containers will be the go-to solution for hosting in the future and by extension for decentralized applications as well. They provide an important component of a universal attested hosting protocol.

Within the container space, we're most excited about Kubernetes, which is the most mature feature-complete open-source container platform we could find (as of June 2015.)

**Decentralize the old-fashioned way**

Codius is just a way to make decentralization easier - it's an optimization, you don't need it. Find partners who will run your software for you and publicly vouch that they are running a specific version and not letting you access the servers.

**Make noise**

Our biggest challenge with Codius was to demonstrate real demand. If you are running a decentralized service and attested hosting would simplify your life, make sure you talk about it.

Equally, if you're a hosting company and you want to offer managed hosting for the purpose of decentralization, make sure people know about it.

If there is demand and corresponding supply there is an obvious incentive for somebody to capitalize on this opportunity.

Shame. I talked with one of the Codius team earlier this year, and they were very happy to discuss how we might work together - Oracles on Codius reporting into Ethereum, that kind of stuff. 

I hope it rises again, perhaps as its own venture.Yeah that's a real shame. There were definitely some great usecases for Codius and potential for great synergy in terms of interaction with the Ethereum ecosystem.

At the same time, 45GB is very very high. Also, the biggest problem/advantage ethereum is facing is we're bootstrapping a POW network facing a lot of scrutiny, when bitcoin was able to grow organically in a slower pace.. So we have more attention, but more to lose.

With great power comes great responsibility. Also, see: http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3avhav/testnet_already_at_30gb/The thing that's always bothered me is that most computations can be purchased, but drive space has to be rented.  Paying some wei for one multiply operation makes sense, but paying some wei once for a byte in storage forever fails the dimensional analysis test.  (Unless you pay so much that it's like creating an endowment that pays rent indefinitely off the interest)"

2015-07-02 18:02:45;How does Ethereum compares to IPFS, MaidSafe and Storj?;"Ethereum > P2P-decentralized computer, based on consensus using a blockchain. All nodes agree on the outcome of computation which is stored in blocks (in contracts). So when contract A receives 20 ETH, it will split the money over address B, C and D. If that's what it's coded to do. Also a system for Apps and a GUI is being build, which makes things very easy to use (MIST). Other protocols are build as well, think for communication like chats, messages and even video ala Skype. 

Maidsafe > P2P-based system for storage and routing (partly Kademlia based). No blockchain involved, close groups reach consensus about transactions for Safecoin. No log for time like in a blockchain. More like digital cash, where the last owner singes it over to the new one. People can ""Farm"" Safecoin by providing storage and bandwidth to the network. A GUI (Safe App Launcher) is build for this project as well. Think of Apps to surf videos or ""Safe-sites"".

StorJ > P2P-based system for storage. It uses a blockchain. People can earn coins when they provide resources like disc space to the network. Don't know if they will work with decentralized websites as well, I think they do..   

Don't know about IPFS. 

Mostly these projects seem to create ""Web 3.0"" and I like them all. Decentralize the internet, and at the same time make things more safe with the use of encryption seems to be the mantra. Kim Dotcom will try to raise 100 million dollar for his project ""Meganet"" which will be about decentralization and encryption as well. Great times ahead :-) How does a Core i7 compare to the microcontroller used on a hard drive? That Core i7 is not very good at storage, it only has like 20MB. (of cache)

That is how this question seems to me. You're asking how an apple compares to an orange."

If I am lazy with my node and ""let it go red"", this means something negative to you? hahahaha.

0.9.40 does not contain any significant changes that can/should block the release and therefor isn't labeled as RC (this however does not mean it won't be included). However finishing the product isn't the only thing that is required to release the platform. The task that is open is indeed still the only thing that is needed to wrap up the client but as I said there are a few other tasks required for full completion. A few things from the top of my head:

* The Foundation wallet
* Status monitoring
* The genesis block
* Legalese
* etc.

Right now we're also in our cooling period, recharging for whatever awaits us ;-)

2015-07-23 22:17:13;Has anyone figured out a way to calculate mining profitability? Or at least a very speculative way to estimate?;"No calculation is really possible without knowing the strength of the live network or the exchange rate of ether.Given the much higher peak level of mining activity we saw back when Olympic had 0.5 ETH on offer per block there are undoubted several large miners waiting in the wings to cut their rigs over to mine Ethereum at the Frontier launch. If you keep an eye on the stats you will notice that several miners have appeared and quickly disappeared that had a lot of hashrate behind them, no doubt testing their mining setups and then switching back to whatever they are mining currently until the launch.

I also expect the AWS EC2 spot rate for g2.8xlarge to surge a bit in the first week or so, until the other bigger miners jump in.

Don't get me wrong - there is going to be plenty of Ether to go around during the first week or so but there will come a point where the Hashrate/Power Cost/Ether Price scales will balance out in favor of those with access to the cheapest power.

That's my best guess - there hasn't been anything quite like Ethereum with as much interest as it currently has and it's a new algo so anything is possible! Should be a crazy ride!I just stumbled across this.. you might find it useful:

2015-07-23 20:55:30;Legal Status of Tokens on Ethereum?;"Ethers are not considered money or a security, but simply a product; namely tokens for accessing the ethereum network.

Ethereum got multiple legal opinions from highly respected law firms regarding this. Their terms of sale specifically outline it.

Tokens on top of the platform won't be treated as money unless they're money.   Some tokens might represent an extra desert at your favorite restaurant.Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, nor should anyone take this as legal advice. 

From [this](http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/firm-types/emoney-institutions) UK gov source I believe it could be considered e-money. But From [this](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/99/regulation/3/made) UK gov source it could be considered to not be e-money. It comes down to what the IOU assets are being used for.

>  For the purposes of these Regulations electronic money does not include monetary value that is used to make payment transactions executed by means of any telecommunication, digital or IT device, where the goods or services purchased are delivered to and are to be used through a telecommunication, digital or IT device, provided that the telecommunication, digital or IT operator does not act only as an intermediary between the payment service user and the supplier of the goods and services.

If I understand this correctly, one could argue that it is not e-money if the assets are only used for good and services that happen on ethereum. AKA you pay a fee in the Euro backed asset to use a DApp. But if the Euro backed asset is being used to buy goods or services from a store or merchant outside of Ethereum then it would be considered e-money.

As I said I am not a lawyer, so anyone who is more informed please feel free to critique my interpretation. Definitely not a lawyer here, but as I understand it ethereum devs will maintain control over the ethereum blockchain for quite some time, taking it eventually to proof-of-stake. So ethereum would seem much more an active product of the devs, rather than a decentralized system like bitcoin (disregarding mining centralization issues). The bitcoin devs can't even get an agreement on a block size increase. So this makes me wonder if the ethereum devs will be exposed to more potential legal issues, should those sort of things come up.

Personally, I'd hope that Ethereum somehow reaches out and zaps any lawyer that comes close to it.

(Have a contract that monitors news feeds, filters for lawyer names because they are properly registered, then somehow gets their boss to fire them. Welcome to the singularity, lol...)

It's going to make Bitcoin look like a passive puppy when it dealt with ""BitLicenses"".

2015-08-06 23:18:37;Is raising cryptoequity on Ethereum subject to SEC regulation a+?;"This is a huge subject, if it is just a thought experiment, start reading about securities regulation and things like the Howey test (from SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.)

If you are considering launching something - first define who you are raising from, then figure out what countries regulation you need to comply with, other questions come to mind like, is it qualified, professional or retail customers who will purchase this crypto token? 

Another thing to then consider is how your token is defined, to do so you need to look at the characteristics of the token, does it pay dividends or have promise of future return on investment? how you market the product also matters...

In short, consult with a lawyer. Reddit won't be able to help you if you go down this rabbit hole.(Not legal advice.) It's not subject to Reg A+ per se, it may be subject to U.S. securities law. Whether it is highly depends on whether what you're selling publicly is a security. 

Reg A+ is actually a _relaxation_ of previous securities law, which says that within certain limits you are allowed to sell private company offerings to regular individuals without the need to (expensively) file with the SEC as a public company. So Reg A+ is one of the ways you can _exempt_ yourself from having to file. Title III of the JOBS Act, which supposedly will be implemented later this year, is yet another way. 

Reg A+ is supposed to help smaller companies do equity crowdfunding. It is a vast improvement over what came before, but as you correctly pointed out, it is expensive and still doesn't give the full free market crowdfunding that we may feel we want in the long term. 

Generally speaking, if you're selling cryptotokens and the buyers are expecting returns on those tokens that you generate on their behalf, you're probably selling a security and are subject to regulation. "
2015-08-06 22:29:03;[Mining] - Need help with Nvidia RIG;"I'm not positive but I think the geth miner.hashrate command only reports a value if you are using geth to do CPU mining.  I mine with eth.exe so I don't know if there is a geth command that reports GPU mining rate.If you start  ethminer with --opencl-device 0 you are only using one of the 2 GPUs on that system. That would account for getting half the hash rate. You can either start two instances of ethminer one with --opencl-device 0 and one with --opencl-device 1 per system. Or just start ethminer without specifying --opencl-device and it will use both cards with just the -G option. If you are serious about mining, trade those cards in for AMD cards. I get 48 MH/s from 2 x 290 cards.Inside Geth, typing miner.hashrate only shows the Geth hashrate.

Of course Geth hashrate is 0, because you are mining with eth. Geth can only CPU mine, and only on the machine you started it.

Basically, if your ethminer consoles show you are mining, you are mining.

Do check that your coinbase is set.

May I recommend the following extra flags?

    geth --autodag 2>>geth.log and ethminer --no-precompute

2015-08-06 21:25:29;Augur: Under what conditions could someone profit from successfully causing the system to acknowledge a false outcome?;"The condition for profit from causing a false outcome (ignoring people with infinite pockets who just want to see the world burn) would be the following:

the network stands to earn more money by wagering on the unlikely outcome of an event then reporting it incorrectly than it would lose in either:

1) rep value lost if it didn't succeed or
2) cost to execute a p+epsilon (bribing) attack (max cost is the cost if the attack fails, which would be covering lost rep value + a small bonus)

In the case of a very contentious outcome these would be roughly the same monetary cost.   Without one of those conditions your higher expected value is to just not cheat.

So the scenario above would most likely occur in a scenario where the network is small, has hardly any markets, and there happens to be one wildly popular market but no others.  (i.e. some market has $10M volume but everything else has thousands).  Since rep should be valued at the value of present and future projected trading fees in the system it would require a lot of money to attack the system (once it's popular) and is only profitable in a (imo) unlikely scenario, which is Augur gets a lot of volume, but only on a very tiny subset of markets.if you had REP and you reported falsely and you got enough people to not only report falsely, but also report falsely the same way you do. also keep in mind, the more people report falsely, the more profit there is in reporting honestly.

I thought I'd give this a try, since it seems to be impossible to lose if it's legit.

I first tried checking the contract code on the blockchain. The eth.getCode('0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e') command did return the value starting with ""0x606060405236156100aa576000357c01..."", like you said. However, when I tried pasting the contract code from http://pastebin.com/A9sE9WNb into the solidity compiler at https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/ ...it returned a value starting with ""60606040525b346001600050..."", even ignoring the 0x part, that is completely different from what the blockchain told me.

I also tried the ""optimize"" button up in the corner, I'm guessing that compresses the code or something... It returned a different bytecode value starting with ""606060405234600155600480..."", still completely different from what it should be.

Now I'm really curious to know what is up with this discrepancy... did I do this wrong somehow? or is the code in the pastebin different from the code that is currently at that address? or is it just a bug in either the solidity compiler or the ethereum client itself?Curious who will be the first to answer the ""bonus"" questions.Wasn't there a reddit button once which you had to keep on pressing.

Edit: I had to do a raw jsonrpc unlock via ipc for the Ethereum GUI I'm working on as it's not yet implemented in web3.js. 

Either way unlocking doesn't currently happen at transaction time, at least for now, I'd like to see the introduction of access tokens for rpc calls but it's not yet available.Interactive unlock should happen on the console. With geth console the implementation is in-process and unlock had always worked. Geth attach uses a separate process communicating with a get node (think system service) via ipc.

A nice GPU card is installed and so are drivers. <something> happened....now I cannot get opencl to list devices or platforms.  So I'm not mining -- only learning how to use the geth console.

Like many others said, you need better documentation.

2015-09-03 19:33:40;Regulation and Augur;"Joey, I am not sure how you can hold this view. Perhaps you are in the strange position of having heard the Libertarian argument first and perhaps from unrespectable sources, that now you feel the need to question the ""us vs them"" narrative of regulators.

Here is the tragic, tragic truth. Inside of government regulatory bodies you will find seemingly sane, seemingly healthy, seemingly ethical, and seemingly reasonable people. This is in stark contrast to what one might expect from hearing libertarians speak. The problem is that the aggregate effect of these regulations are almost without exception regulatory capture. IE, these same nice people end up brokering power to incumbent groups and special interest at the expense of the rest of the population. 

This can be a very tough disparity to process for people inside or close to the system. My experience has been that when people inside a machine that takes babies in the one end and outputs sausage on the other see the system for what it is, their initial reaction is; ""I must be the best cog in the baby-sausage machine that I can be and change the system from within!"" This has, as far as I can see, only lead to two outcomes for the individual, either A. they stay and become consciously delusional about the nature of what they do, or B. they leave. 

The fact is that your argument is totally reasonable, but that regulators do not exist because of reasonable win-win arguments. They exist because it is possible to use force to control people and once that is allowed, economics kick in and a market for influencing that force develops. This means that on the aggregate, regulators will act in the interest of those they've brokered power to. As an absolutely blatant example of this you can go read the NY Bit License. 

Sorry buddy, but you **are** a revolutionary, whether you like that frame or not :D The crypto-anarchist movement is probably the biggest threat the state has yet encountered. Joey, to make sure Augur users 'comply with local rules' will there be some sort of a IP-tracker when Users login to the Augur prediction market website (ie like CounterParty) which will disable all functions for IP's coming from 'local regions' where it's not exactly legal to use prediction markets?> baited breath

Nitpick: it's bated breath. Meaning, you're so absorbed by what you're watching, your breath abates. Baited breath would be from eating cheese.If Ethereum, and by relation Augur, are even half way successful there is no need for a state. A state cannot exist in such an environment. These seem like ninja tactics to get regulators off their back until it's too late for them to stop them. Might mean people will have more incentive to use services to outsource their rep management.

Usually you specify a number of shares and you send exactly the amount of Ether with it of the costs if the price does not move.

Since in a live game it is clearly possible that someone else does a transaction within the same block only one transaction would go trough.

So we just made the dirty fix that you send by default 10% more ether - if the price moved you are willing to pay up to 10% more per share. If if doesn't moved the contract will send the 10% back.

Later we will have a more sophisticated version where you are in control of all options.A market speculating on the bitcoin mem pool size or minimum  transaction fee to be included in a new block would be really fun with the stress test going on."
2015-09-10 19:17:41;How resilient is Ethereum?;"> As I see it, Bitcoin is basically done. Ethereum can issue a currency such as Bitcoin with a few lines of code and be more efficient at the same time (waste less resources).

If currencies are essentially just contracts then this statement holds true because Ethereum can do programmable p2p contracts better than anything out there.

> So my question is, how resilient will Ethereum be in the future? How easy will it be to modify the code to adopt to new technolog and industry changes?

You can easily develop contracts that can be updated based on a set of pre-defined rules (i.e. voting, multi-sig, namereg switching, etc..) so it's up to the developer to implement future proofing mechanisms.

> HMC: Ethereum is a Turing complete logic, per block. This means they can easily prove that they can compute any computable thing in one block, but at the cost of not being able to necessarily know how much resource it will take to do the block's computation.Because of this, they need to back their resources with a fixed token asset, and set a network-wide resource price on computations in order to avoid abuse of resource. Further, in order to secure exchange, they require everyone who is validating the block to effectively re-execute everything that has ever been executed.

Each contract/transaction has to be validated by the nodes as they download the blocks.  The quote above is a bit misleading.  Re-execution happens when your node downloads new blocks and runs through the state transition steps for every transaction and there are no additional costs to this (save for electricity needed to keep your node up and running)  


> Because of this, they need to back their resources with a fixed token asset, and set a network-wide resource price on computations in order to avoid abuse of resource.

This really isn't true... Gas isn't a ""fixed token asset"" and there's no network-wide price. Each transaction sets its own gas price, and in theory it wouldn't even have to be in Ether, it could be a sub currency or even an off-chain currency.Till now it's very hard to evaluate correctly the capabilities of Ethereum transactional aspect as most of mined blocks have zero transaction, the Turing complete logic, per block is not heavily tested at all. 
 
We are observing a system  around 140 Tx per hour, far away from the minimum requirement to evaluate the superiority of the design of Ethereum.

Another option if you live in London, you have a free mattress and you accept crypto to rent it, let me know! :-) 
  
Thank you in advance. https://www.bitrated.com/jmiehau

Have you thought about taking a quick  straw poll to see the actual number of people interested in attending (and able to attend on those dates) to get a realistic answer about your week long  conference date choice?

If you don't reach an attendee target, will it be canceled? What is that number and by what date would you decide to cancel?

If you need to reach a financial target to make this event happen (where otherwise you would suffer a loss and cancel) will there be a crowd funded contract, in escrow, being immediately offered?

Will ether and bitcoin be accepted to attend? Do you need volunteers to make the event happen? (i.e. do you have any work/trade available in exchange for free or reduced price tickets) <--sign me up for that please.

This is a community of collaborative and helpful folks. If your resources of time, talent, and treasure are stretched do not hesitate to ask folks here for help!If/when you confirm that DEVcon1 will be live-streamed, I'll be *extremely* grateful that I'll have the opportunity to remotely participate in this exciting event!

I love a good challenge, so I went to figuring some numbers and speculating:

Gibson Hall has ~6,400 sqft (600 sqm), maximum capacity 400 (depends on how the room is arranged, that's probably uncomfortably max) (That's all on Gibson Hall's own page)

edit: 600 is the standing room only capacity number, 400 is if you have rows of seats

Subscribers to this subreddit are 6,000 at the time of this post. Probably most people aren't motivated enough to travel half way across the planet and can't get an entire week off of work. Although this might be a once in a lifetime event, might be pretty awesome.

Approximate location rental cost: Around $45k USD for the five days https://hirespace.com/Spaces/London/11345/Gibson-Hall/Whole-Venue/Weddings#Prices

My guess is: 250 people attend, at that - ticket price is at least $360 for the week. (My guesstimate is probably off by some enormous factor? More if they have to pay speakers or cater food.) In my mind, I can see this being anywhere from half that much to double that much. But probably in that range. (Unless they really want to charge a premium or if they have discounts or smaller/larger chunks of time.)

Exciting!
Travel booked!  Now just need to get devcon tickets...Is this actually still happening? 

Myself and some others have made room reservations at Wombats City Hostel. Works out to 30€/night.

Without a price announcement for the conference, however, and without  confirmation that DEVCON is actually  happening, who can really commit to buying the airfare now? And the price of airfare is rising everyday there is further delay on announcement.

But the concepts are very similar. One thing you could consider is how to associate voting with raising money. Basically weighting votes by the amount donated to the organization. This way you can create a community that give as much weight to the ""voluntaries"" people that work and receive the crypto as ""salary"" or by answering to some bounty requests, and the donators to the organization. Those are the two components of the organization and they should in practice be able to vote proportionally to their involvement. The more you care, the more you donate your time/money, the more you have influence in the decision process. Ethereum offer the possibility to do this in a pseudo-anonymity, and to encode organization-building operand conditioning crypto-currency incentivization into the DNA of your organization.

This basically describes both Ethereum and a perfect scenario for IoT. Any device with the built capability can spend ETH from it's wallet to communicate via the blockchain. 

Furthermore, not only can the device communicate on its own network as it would if it were powered by, say, IBM servers, it can communicate with any device from any company on Ethereum. For example this means that instead of automatically ordering an overpriced replacement bulb only from IBM at the end of it's life, it could search for the least expensive equivalent replacement that has a good reputation. As far as I understand, the idea is to implement (in Ethereum 2.0 or 3.0, but certainly after switch to Proof of Stake) Ethereum consisting of many sub-chains, or fibers, each validated by its own set of validators, merged together by some other validators, and sending messages to each other in some ways. Each fiber will have its own database if you like. This might take few years to come about though"

The way pools work is that they give you work that is easier than solo-mining, meaning that you will find a valid share every few seconds or minutes. Occasionally, someone will find a share that is good enough to submit to the network, but the ether will be given to the pool, since shares are only valid if the coinbase is set to the pools address.

If you check your balance on etherpool, it should be increasing (but it might take a bit to update)"

Vitalik has suggested a few possible routes [https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/09/28/the-evolution-of-ethereum/]. There is, in my opinion, a substantial possibility of it being done in concert with resources and funds from industry.

I'm generally in favour of neutrality over the specific terms of account for a stakeholder solution (""currency-agnostic""), since it removes certain human-centric issues: maximalism is generally not a good thing IMO, be it Bitcoin or Ether and freeing a technology platform from an underlying ""currency"" would, I think, result in far greater overall adoption.

That said, I'm yet to convince Vitalik on its merits, it looks rather difficult to implement and I don't, in any case, consider it a particularly important ""feature"". Once I think of ether as a ""decentralised service token"", and expunge ""currency"" from my mind, then I already feel better.

As far as I am aware, the Foundation has not sold any Ether on the open market.There was a question from the audience that I think should have explained that contracts also have addresses so the msg.sender/tx.origin would also apply to contracts calling other contracts.  I actually quite liked his talk. He might also call it ""back to Smalltalk"" :) Though, of course, Ethereum is different from Smalltalk in many ways...The funding round or the improvements?

2015-11-12 14:48:53;What Project Presentations Have Been Most Impressive at Devcon1?;"Really too many to name all...I would say amazingly Day 4 probably tops it so far (and Day 1 was hard to beat, close second).

But I will still say....IPFS. Not just the talk itself on Monday, but seeing it being brought up constantly in a large number of other talks up to today as an integral component to their projects. The implications are huge and as they said 'it's a perfect fit' :). Very excited for it as that will be the backbone of the holy grail (or unholy, however you see it).

Another non-obvious one (aside from the 'exciting' ones like slock.it etc) was the talk from Deloitte. Good speaker + very interesting to see the perspective from a large, traditional/legacy firm. But what was most interesting and amazing thing to me was the tone....it was essentially them hard-selling themselves to the community -- not the other way around. If you told me only a year ago that would be happening, I wouldn't have believed it.I just want to say that I've been extremely impressed by everything I've seen this week.  This entire conference was very well done.Juan from ipfs is a natural. It's fantastic to see him describe how everything should function in today's day and age I also really enjoyed the many panels. I found the back and forth between brilliant minds to be entertaining and informative. I especially liked dr Christian lundqvist. I feel like his mind just works differently. I'm really enjoyed the Weifund and Boardroom presentation. I love the idea and was really excited to see what they were working on more in depth. Not to mention I'm working on a business model that would be powered by it and it worked much better than I thought!!! The most jaw dropping is when you think how they can/will be all connected. Imagine in the future someone playing a game in China and he/she finds a rare item and this person  frees his vunk and some 30 seconds later this token with its value buys someone in Kenya a sewing machine as microcredit.Slock.it and Piper Merrian are the best, and also I am really that a organization is looking to leverage the Ethereum contracts on Africa (4G Capital).

- Mist is launched
- Ether reaches some stability and a bigger market cap to sustain stablecoins

However, as for impact on the situation TODAY, no other project is as impactful as BTCrelay.  

BTCrelay will allow to transfer your Bitcoins to a Bitcoin sidechain on Ethereum in the same way that the the Liquid sidechain by Blockstream works: for every Bitcoin you send to a multisig address you trust, Bitcoin-representing tokens can be created on Ethereum.

These tokens are compatible with the Token protocol used by a.o. the Wallet that is already released, and can be used in smart contracts.

BTCrelay allows the Bitcoin community to use all of the things Ethereum offers, and they are the first possible audience before we can even dream of expanding to a mainstream audience.  They know what a blockchain is, and they have the capital.IPFS obviously

2015-11-12 14:42:49;A fair namespace without tokens or crowdsale;"Vickrey auction & monaco tax seem good. But there is going to be a hell of lot of debate around the collector contract,election mechanism, use of funds and the first auction mechanism.This is an excellent model and this namespace likely would do quite well. Part of the power of the current ENS design is that you can build this system and curators simply link it in to `/mist` or `/d/` or whatever else you use it for.

Consider this, if there's even one namespace use case which isn't met by this auction mechanism, then you'll have a split namespace anyway. I still think permanent-set curation is the way to deal with this at the TLN level, there's no ""best"" name model, but the profit motive will ensure curators do a good job keeping it clean and basically only using it to assign to subregistries with smarter mechanisms.

If you don't like tokens the next best thing I could think of would be a committee of 7 trusted community memebers which I think many would think is much less fair than just handing out 70% stake to them then selling 30% in a crowdsale (money goes to the DAO itself).Sounds like a reasonable and simple approach- I am a little worried though that each person registering a name will have to do quite a bit of game theoretical analysis to prevent their domain from getting snatched away... This could create cognitive load for individual users of the system and could lead to a lot of irrational behavior from novice users.

It seems like it would be better to have a similar system, but which defaults in the short term to the simple case of ""if I keep paying for my domain nobody can take it away from me""

The thinking here is to have a built in ""minimum fee"" (just like with current com/org/etc domains where it is around $10) and start with an ""owner multiplier"" (the same multiplier described in your post) that is super high, like 1000x. Then, also have frequent auctions for each domain, like maybe weekly auctions.

However, every time in the weekly auction, if your domain is a ""disputed"" domain (i.e. a domain where there are opposing bids that meet some threshold) your multiplier gets halved for next week's auction.

The point of this is that 99% of people can use the simple heuristic of ""As long as I pay my minimum fee, my domain is safe"" but the remaining 1% will get alerts from the namespace dapp saying ""Warning! your domain is being challenged!"" and then ONLY THOSE PEOPLE have to learn about vickrey auctions, etc. But due to the high starting multiplier they have a time window to learn all this stuff, so they can formulate well-informed bid amounts in the auction process going forward. (But of course having a ""challenged"" domain is potentially a good thing, since the owner, if well informed enough, could make a financial windfall.)

Without some short-term protection for novice users like this, it seems like there could be a danger of a large entity trying to ""corner the namespace market"" by secretly putting up large bids for many domains at the same time in a way that is unexpected.

(I haven't fully thought through the obvious economic attack on this system though, whereby people purposely ""lose"" the auction to themselves, just to keep resetting the multiplier to a high value.)The idea about having a minimum char length is a good one. Why not go further and start with a high numbe4 of characters, like 12, and auction off shorter names one character less at a time as the system matures? Then you dont need to worry about getting it completely right the second time round.This is definitely the best auction model I've seen yet, and it seems as something that would be well suited for registering names in mist and other public goods, as it is almost completely decentralized (I think the collectors contract should just be hardcoded as 0 - let ETH be profitable).

I'd argue that there's room for both this and ENS though, as there is going to be demand for TLN's that don't expire.I think the censorship worry is a big one. Paypalsucks.com has had a pretty big impact, but they wouldn't have lasted long if paypal could kick them off every domain they tried to use. 

Personally, I think that top level domains should be given out very carefully, but the number of them should grow over time. Then second-level domains can just use something like the current system. With multiple namespaces and reasonable fees, I don't think namesquatting is particularly problematic. First, very interesting and I definitely like the general idea, but I'm not sure if the same multiplier is workable at different price scales...

How do you see this working between the following groups:

1. Google (billion $ scale)
2. Squatter (?? $ scale)
3. Mid-level business (million $ scale)
4. Hobbiest ($10-$100 per year??)Dumb question: What are some examples of typical Ethereum names that might be bid for?fairness by wealthI like this a lot. But I also think it highlights a reason we'll sometimes want to use addresses directly. If I call a contract by name, I don't necessarily know for sure that the name is still pointing to the contract I think it's pointing to. If I send a whisper message by name, I don't necessarily know it's going to the person I think, unless I doublecheck the address.

Hence checksums and human-readable address formats.These proposals are quite reminiscent of how commercial real estate works today.

We all know of the independent bookstore (call it ""bookstore"") that opens in a run down neighborhood of town with a 5 year lease with an option to renew.  The implicit assumption is that they will have to renegotiate their lease after 10 years to market rate (assuming the 5 year option was well structured from the lessee's perspective).  Then after 10 years, the neighborhood has undergone gentrification and the independent bookstore that was the first business in the area can no longer afford the lease on the property and that lease gets taken over by a much larger national chain ""bookstore"" for double or triple the original amount.

This scenario happens every day in the real world with people who build important but perhaps low-profit businesses on Ethereum in the early days being forced out in the future by larger players.

It sounds like it could lead to a huge mess.This is a particularly difficult issue to think through and implement in a fair manner.  My background is ~20 years in the domain name space, the ICANN controlled one... and also a few years now infatuated with cryptocurrencies.  The first domain names I registered were in 1994, when all domains were free.  The only restriction at that time was a loosely enforced ""one domain name per entity"" rule--so I, like many others, registered names under my mom's name, a sister's name, grandparent's name, etc.  Though in total, perhaps about a dozen names--I gamed the system a little, but  didn't take advantage of it like many of the early ""squatters"" did.  I say ""squatters"" as that's another debate, whether or not a pejorative should be used to described some of the early individuals who had foresight into how thing would evolve.  

ICANN is obviously not the model for how namespaces in Ethereum should be managed.  

But, similarly to the way Bitcoin mining has become essentially centralized, or oligopolized, the economic forces that drive centralization of so many things is a powerful force to contend with, even if the central organization, like ICANN, is a ""non-profit.""

I would perhaps study the manner in which the new gTLDs were launched--not the TLD's themselves, that's an entirely different matter, but the secondary namespaces, like *.XYZ, that seemed to have some success in getting distributed adoption.

Each gTLD was required by ICANN to submit their registration process rules, and each one of the ~2,000 new gTLD's has its own methodology, from highly restrictive and expensive, to open and cheap.   But yah, ultimately they are all controlled by this central org, ICANN.  Several hundred different economic models were created for these launches, and all of them are publically available to read through.

A few comments made above/below resonate with me.  Some final thoughts before I spend a great deal more time thinking about this. 

(1) The bidding system should be easy for the average person to understand, at least in the long run.  If it's too complicated, it will be too complicated to manage future change, and risks turning users away.   As simple as domain names are, they can often be too complicated for the average person. (I was four years in tech support for a registrar, on the front lines).  It's amazing how few people really understand, in 2016, domain names.  

(2) Move slowly and iterate intelligently, methodically.  I really like the idea of applying the first model to a subset of names, such as those greater than n characters in length.  And then learning from that and moving on to the next generation of thought--better thought, based on empirical feedback that doesn't put the entire namespace at risk of a bad idea.

(3) These namespaces are property.  And if you take peoples' property without due process--like seizing somebody's bank account, or seizing somebody's private key, via some centralized or coded-in-stone system that allows the big corporations to always prevail economically (like some of the math leads me to believe above), then the namespace system will fail.  These names deserve property rights similar to real estate. But it's not a perfect metaphor. Intellectual property rights, like trademark rights, have evolved over hundreds of years to help manage conflict between entities, and help protect the *little guy* from the big guy.  So the more capriciously or arbitrarily the system treats these names, the less successful it is likely to be. 

Perhaps this is just stating the obvious, and I haven't yet addressed the actual mathematics here .. I want to think about this much more.

It does seem like a good use case for Occam's razor.  

There is an optimal solution out here somewhere, though perhaps there are simpler, easier to understand methods that effect the same end goals of achieving a fair, distributed namespace while respecting individual property rights.  A poorly implemented namespace could have a deleterious effect on Ethereum.

I would take a look at NASA's new TCP/IP replacement architecture (DTN/ION) and how they are approaching namespace.  Some info here:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ion-dtn/  Vint Cerf is behind it, and they are accutely aware of trying to avoid the same hoarding/squatting situation that happened not just with domains, but with IP address blocks from what I gather.

Who knows, you may end up eventually getting ETH from your bank if R3 sees more potential in Ethereum than Bitcoin for off-chain and public chain transactions ;-)Well my question to you: **Permission from whom, exactly?** 

Acquiring Ether is trivial, and effectively automated by modern crypto exchanges, there's no strong arguement that can be made about needing human permission, especially since selling the Ether that is acquired by validation and collation is required to pay the bills.

In the long term, one could probably sign up for an online service that can meter out rewards in Ether, eg Gitter with an Ether extension, or simply make a payment through an international bank account (IBAN?) on an exchange. 

Political leylines being damned. It's difficult to enforce politics on the internet in the exclusion of very brittle, and blanket policies on ISP's.If you cannot mine them nor buy them, then earn them. Create value and get paid in Ether, easy right?
And it is going to be very easy to buy a few on your mobile phone without signing any paper anyway. You can already buy BTC with your phone, no credit card nor bank account required.
Mining in PoW takes a considerable investment to do, it's not something any of the computers we own in my family are capable of doing even reasonably well. So buying just makes more sense.

Joining the chain permissionlessly creates the ""nothing at stake problem"".> So when Ethereum switches to PoS, could we keep a mechanism whereby someone can join the chain ""permissionlessly""?

PoS makes it possible [for a chain to be bought](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3flj4x/if_ethereum_adopts_casper_proof_of_stake_it_is/ctqhekg), and if that happens the chain becomes permissioned. There's no known mechanism of getting around this. See related [recent discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3sp0n6/devcon1_5min_talk_measuring_decentralization/cx1sz5c).

The best mitigation is to have **independent** validators spread out across **different countries**."

2015-11-26 21:19:03;Is it possible to run a full Eth node on the new 5$ Raspberry Pi Zero (private or public);"Yes it is. And it's $385 cheaper then the famous ""bitcoin computer"". Also, when PoS comes, you'd be able to *actually* mine on it, by simply shipping it with some ether.

But I think you are missing the best part: add swarm/IPFS and a $50 1 terabyte hard drive and you get a very nice mesh networking box, that you could potentially plug on the wall, would connect to the internet and other boxes around it and simply make money by renting hard drive and bandwidth.


Can't wait to get one in my hands to try. But I think yes.
I don't know about the Raspberry Pi Zero, but geth runs fine on my Raspberry Pi 2 B.
Besides disk space, there are little requirements for running geth.
The question is whether it will validate blocks fast enough once the network gets bigger -- I assume it would as of today.I imagine processors are so cheap and small they will soon be able to be integrated into contracts. As in an actual paper contract could come with its own encrypted tag. Although i suppose you can just do that with rfid tags

2015-11-26 16:05:38;Imagine Ethereum as the infrastructure to trade for the Carbon Credit Market;"[Climatecoin](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2425/climatecoin-tackling-climate-change-with-ethereum) is my attempt at a voluntary solution to climate change using an Ethereum subcurrency. Basically it mints coins for people who offset carbon. I don't think it could come close to completely solving the problem, but I think it could do better than purely voluntary efforts do now.

Some other efforts along these lines are [Sno-Caps](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300404/planId/1305801) (by James D'Angelo, who's fairly well-known in the Bitcoin community), and [Solar Dollars](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1302401/phaseId/1311013/planId/1323902).

My personal view, in agreement with many [economists](http://carbon-price.com/), is that cap-and-trade isn't the best way to go, and a simple fee per ton of emitted carbon has a lot of advantages. (The fees would be charged at major sources like coal mines.) Ideally the fees would be returned to the population, equal amounts per capita, much like Alaska does with its oil royalties; anyone using less carbon than average would come out ahead. That's the [fee-and-dividend](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/) proposal.

A system like that could be enhanced by letting people pay to absorb CO2, and receive tradable vouchers for that, which can be used to pay the fees. I wrote about that [here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/5/planId/15204). A cryptocurrency could be a good way to implement the vouchers.Dont encourage them!

2015-12-03 23:59:18;What features would you like see in an ethereum enabled reddit alternative?;"Mods as filters that can be turned on and off individually. Say you have a bot that is really good at determining if a post or comment is a joke/meme. Well some people like that and some people dont. You should not have to split a community into different forums or fight over which content is allowed: let people choose individually. This way also if a particular mod becomes a problem then users can just switch them off without having to leave /r/bitcoin for /r/btc. Having some way to aggregate user preferences in order to produce a default mod list or suggested mod list for content would be good too. Features? None

...at least to start. It'd be far better to release an MVP that works without servers of any kind and then let actual usage dictate which ""features"" are most useful for furthering the communitySecurity deposit based threads. Everyone that wants to post has to spend ~10 cents. If they get downvoted into oblivion, they lose it. They get paid back ~1 penny per day as long as vote threshold is above 0.Anonymity, moderator electionUpvotes worth a tiny fraction of ETH. Maybe to lower barriers to entry, upvotes are free but the equivalent of Reddit gold gives a substantial tip to the commenter, or a two tier voting system where paid votes count for more? Basically something where the best commenter are compensated.Now that I've read and replied to the many thoughtful comments I will throw my own feature I would like to see.

... and that is that it be a DAO! I decentralized reddit structured in the perfect way can create incentives for creating high quality content and foster intelligent discussions. Thus driving in more users and more demand for high quality content.Most of what follows is quite advanced, and might not be necessary at all:

A clearly defined interface that allows bots to interact with users and themselves. Payment channels for high volume interactions (e.g. video/newsfeeds).

Reddit Enhancement Suite features such as image loading (over IPFS. Make sure to check the file size and type first). 

A pseudonymous system. Registration could be done in a contract. If name collisions are allowed, the self chosen name could be underlaid by the actual identicon of the identity.

The ability to run as Dapp. The main site should be hosted on a server somewhere, with additional functionality. After creating an identity locally, other users could ""invite"" this person and send them a small amount of ether to get the conversation started.

Additionally, an easy way to purchase more Ether or a service plan based system, possibly with https://accepton.com/ (Paypal, bitpay, stripe etc.) integration. As with any other coin, 99% of users will never notice nor want to understand the underlying system. It doesn't matter how great it is, if you want large scale adoption, it should be as easy to use as existing systems. This includes not necessarily having to install Ethereum/IPFS nodes in order to use it. Therefore, provide gateways. I still hope for the unification of IPNs libp2p and Ethereums Whisper, it would make this so much easier and efficient.

Possibly automatic content watermarks, to prevent freebooting, should tips be integrated.

You also need a way of pinning the content on IPFS and keeping it accessible 24/7. If users host themselves and the data is not duplicated it will only be available when they are online. Until Filecoin is available there needs to be another solution.

2015-12-17 18:53:25;The Case Against Augur;"This just made him sound like a tosser:

> For those who get a PhD, but instead go on to work in industry, the interpretation is usually that they were unable to get an academic job. 

My interpretation is that they get sick of working long hours for not much pay whilst having to deal with people like Paul Sztorc.> Jack Peterson, Augur Head Fraudster, graduated with a PhD awhile back from Some-School-I-had-to-Google in California.

And Paul Sztorc wonders why is there a team of 'dedicated social-media influencers'.

Most people DON'T understand the subtlities of his argument against Augur, however they do understand that in most of the cases, a lack of civil discourse an indication of frustration arising from not having a substantial argument.

Way before I had any kind of opinion on Augur vs Truthcoin, all I saw was that Jack critiques only and only Truthcoin and Bitcoin(more specifically the shortcomings of Truthcoin and annoyance of Bitcoin's source code to expand things). On the other hand, Paul would get involved in really acrimonious 'opinion dumping'.

People tag him and say incendiary stuff mostly to bait him (and it's so easy), whereas doing that to Jack or Joey would useless.dude sure loves to jack himself offI remember hearing a story about how Steve Jobs took a tour of the Xerox research department.  They showed him the mouse.  He was amazed by it.  He asked why they were not selling this yet.  The developers wants to get it perfect before selling it.  So he went home and started screaming at the people he worked with to build it faster.  They did.  

Augur may have outright stolen much of Paul's work.  That would piss me off too.  But first to market counts for a lot.  I think one reason Paul hates Ethereum so much is that you can program so much fast than with Bitcoin.  So Truthcoin -- having chosen to build on Bitcoin -- never had a fighting chance.  Augur will gain network effects.  Truthcoin will be stillborn.  (Or GroupGnosis will beat Augur and Truthcoin as they are already putting out a product -- even if Beta.  But it works.  I've been using it.  I'm about to go make a prediction on the presidential election right now...)

Edit: heard a rumor there was already a market up on Gnosis for the presidential election but I don't see one yet...
Content of the article:

* Bitterness
* a few arguments, mostly ad hominem
* A rant against Ethereum
* Bitcoin maximalism

Did I miss any other subtle point?Timeline according to Paul:

> I start working on decentralised prediction markets (...), I write off the idea as ""fun but too complicated""
> Ethereum appears, project is ludicrously complex, founders are clueless, Vitalik i worshipped as a saviour 
> Bitshares appears... a horribly convoluted mess. People seem to actually like it.
> Counterparty appears and claims to be able to handle trestles betting, a claim I know to be ridiculous 
> My project is much better than these

So he writes up an idea, doesn't pursue it, craps on every single project that appears later, calls everyone stupid for not agreeing with him, still thinks his idea is the best thing ever. And he wonders why people hate him?

[Ideas are worthless](https://sivers.org/multiply). This world belongs to those that build things, not for those that sit on bed thinking up stuff and then complaining about those who try to do something about it.that was painful to read... Didn't people who invested in Ethereum make a decent amount...

iirc, at time of crowdsale 1 btc was about $600 usd. 

So $600 for 2,000 ether.

Ether is worth $0.95 now. 

2,000 x $0.95 = $1,900

That's over 3x on investment. 

Dude is super condescending towards anything that isn't his.belongs in r/ethtrader if anywhereMan, /u/psztorc , I thought you would have had enough by now, but I guess in for a penny, in for a pound, and nothing like doubling down.This guy is fluffypony on steroids. They claim to have great technical arguments *(which I would welcome, as I'm also sceptical about Augur)*, but somehow their posts always devolve into snarky personal attacks. Paul this is just downright terrible. You made eclectic points strung together with a litany of personal attacks, useless video references that don't prove your point, and incredibly self-oblivious self-righteousness. 

Dude how can anyone take you seriously. You position yourself as an expert in academia yet every time I read your posts its always the same drama and spiteful dribble. 

Critiquing augur and ethereum is great, please write articles about the specific mechanisms that make it weak. Yet if you need to rely on puffing up your work and downplaying others, then why should anyone take you seriously?

3. RELIANCE ON ETHEREUM IS FOOLISH
Augur, despite my endless protests, is built on Ethereum.

Ethereum is a running joke among Bitcoin experts. To the clearminded, it’s failure as an “investment” was always a foregone conclusion.

Here are some bullet points in no particular order:

A. Since transitioning from academic experiment to full-blown dishonest scam, Ethereum is laughed at at Bitcoin conferences.

B. For econo-math reasons, Ethereum is incapable of supporting “oracle contracts” (of which Augur is one). tl;dr How can “Rep” have a market cap, if the operations performed by the “Rep”-holders can be perfectly copied, for free? Therefore, market cap (and, crucially, the betting security margin) will be prohibitively low.

C. When Vitalik proposed Ethereum, the technical elite of Bitcoin were so impressed that 0% of them decided to endorse/join the project (compare this to hardware wallets, colored coins, stealth addresses, sidechains, elements project [confidential transactions, tree signatures, RCLTV], lightning network, and my own project).

D. The concept “don’t roll your own crypto” is very old, constantly-reproven, and universally endorsed. Crypto takes a very long time to get right; critical errors were regularly discovered in Bitcoin (which was actually a finished software product when it was published in Jan 2009) and continue to be discovered today. However, Bitcoin at least has consistent rules, and thanks to the Soft Fork the security can at least accumulate over time. With Ethereum, every contract changes the rules completely, and resets the potential chaos (For example, “Contract Z commits to ‘'’If contract X is created, auto-create the opposite of X and overfund it by Q.’’’ which disables contract X.” which leads to symmetry-gridlock).

E. Ethereum is out of money, the software will never reach a stable, usable state.

F. The Ethereum team endorses an even bigger running joke: proof of stake, which is also laughed at and compared to perpetual motion. There are reasons that Bitcoin embraced P2SH and LN, but rejected PoS, GHOST, etc.

G. Today, most people have still not heard of Bitcoin. Most that have, still don’t trust it. Quadruple that problem for Ethereum, as it has an even greater reliance on group(s) of people coordinating to switch to it.

H. Ethereum is strategically trapped: if they fail, the Ether will be worthless, and if they are successful, the project will be forked as a sidechain of Bitcoin (and the Ether will be worthless). They can only survive by maintaining “Goldilocks Success” and by generally being as vague as possible (which explains the overly-ambitious plans, countless buzzwords, endless promotional videos, etc).

Ethereum has only one use-case: quickly finding the most gullible “investors” people…those people who own Bitcoin but can’t think quickly enough to sort the signal from the noise.Ok so,

I don't think I fully get the argument being made about Oracle's being infeasible because they can be copied.

I read that claim in more detail a while ago, but I forget the details.

Why is it a problem if other contracts can get info from a contract, and why is it worse than with two separate blockchains?

I'm skeptical of most of this blog post, but the part that was about Roxcoin I am a little concerned about? I'd like to hear an explanation of that, if available.

Thanks, 

Hai

This post gives me a bellyache. I am a commercial lawyer in USA. I started teaching myself coding this year as a skills update for smart contracts, etc. Whitepapers in this space blew my paradigm of law/lawyering, and it's a constant learning curve in every dimension. 

The content of the work lawyers do keeps us in a tech delay, and our schools don't know what non-tech lawyers do for a living, let alone tech lawyers. For years, we have done content based work for large clients who require an exclusive, dedicated communication and data management system - a closed system. Some don't even run wifi unless entertaining guests who expect it because it's ""risky.""  At least that's my experience.

Our concept of security is battening down the hatches.  Also, the slowest system, the courts, defines our standards and so lawyers have to produce for something that is just above lowest common denominator. Lawyers don't make changes to data security without a blessing from above because they have seen so many promised solutions end up being liability magnets. The problem with this ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" mentality is that we are working so hard on our tricycles we don't notice the spaceship overhead. 

You hit the nail on the head: I still fumble like a noob on a some of those seemingly simple things like the newest data tech for file-sharing, whether a phone or video chat is the right thing, acronym soup, etc. I'm not trying to get your work - I am sure you will find one in a closer jurisdiction. I just want you to know some of us are trying. Happy 2016. bobsummerwill:

(A few months late, but I just found this.)

**TL;DR: It is hard for lawyers to keep up with FinTech, but easier for younger ones.  You probably won't talk to the younger ones.  Smart firms that understand the magnitude of the changes already happening and still to come are trying very hard to develop real expertise about blockchain.  Law firms face different constraints when it comes to data sharing, but that is not a sufficient defence for how slowly they are adopting cloud and FTP tools.**

I think a significant part of the problem is that clients place a premium on experience when looking for a lawyer.  Which almost always means clients are looking for older, seasoned lawyers.  That means, generally, clients won't be talking to lawyers who know much about computers or the internet--let alone cryptocurrency or DAOs.  Most older lawyers are getting the message that FinTech is ""good"" and that certain buzzwords must be thrown around.  But there is still a huge chunk of experienced lawyers who know absolutely nothing about FinTech.   

As a minor defence of lawyers, I will just say that it is tricky to stay current with the law of new technology because we have to understand the underlying subject matter quite well before we can analyze it from a legal perspective. Especially because the laws in question were not made with future technology in mind. Most lawyers have backgrounds in arts, philosophy, business, and some in general sciences or engineering.  A lucky few may have trained in CS.   But overall, we face a big hurdle on the subject matter.  After that, we have to figure out where this tech is going and how the law will apply to it.  Younger lawyers have an easier time learning about new technology because even if we don't have a computing background, we probably understand general computing concepts better: some of us started elementary school on computers.  I have no formal training, but building websites and computers, online gaming, and, of course, Reddit, have been my hobbies for most of my life.  I've been reading about crytocurrency since the earliest days of Bitcoin.  Even still, it is a struggle to really understand the technology and to keep up with all the emerging uses.

With all of that out of the way, I can tell you that smart firms are trying to harness the knowledge and experience of their younger, tech-savvy lawyers (so I don't over generalize, some older lawyers are very tech-savvy).  Some firms already have working and practice groups with national teams who are trying to keep current with FinTech developments, to learn the technical side of new technology, and to predict how our traditional bricks and mortar law will apply to and regulate FinTech (if at all).  My firm has a large, active group with diverse expertise.

If you want to have some fun, ask a lawyer how traditional business organizations legislation will apply to DAOs.  This is something I have been thinking about a lot since reading about the DAO on the Ethereum platform.  

Some lawyers might think developing a practice in FinTech is like rushing to get a job as a horse-drawn-carriage driver delivering steel to the Model-T factory.  DAOs and smart contracts could put a lot of lawyers out of business, true. [Insert lawyer jokes here]  But I don't think the courts and legislatures will cede oversight that easily.  Business and contract law have always been broader than just the nuts and bolts of a transaction, especially when it comes to litigation.  And, in any event, in the transition period, there will be a lot of fascinating, cutting-edge legal work.

I think if you ask firms you approach if they have a person or group working on FinTech initiatives, you will be put in touch with someone who has some actual knowledge about blockchain.  Just be cautious about getting put in touch with someone who only understands those buzzwords are ""good"".  It looks like you have some good recommendations already, but feel free to PM me if you are still looking or want to discuss any of this further.  I'm on here in my personal capacity only, hence the throw away.

Regarding document sharing, I feel your pain.  Law firms are really paranoid about sending data through the US--rightfully so.  We have a lot of ethical constraints on top of the usually privacy considerations.  I don't know the exact state of the rules off the top of my head, but most Canadian lawyers won't send data to/through the US without express consent.  This really limits our tools for cloud sharing, FTP sites, etc.  The bigger firms will often have their own FTP portals to get around this issue.  If you are having issues sharing documents with your lawyer, the junior lawyer is who you want to talk to about technical solutions.  But overall, most firms are in a sorry state in this area.  Refer back to the discussion above about lawyers and age.  This also makes law firms overly change resistant--to the incredible frustration of the younger generations and tech-savvy clients.

Anyways, that's my two tokens.  

Edit: formatting.Currently working at a Mayfair based law firm in London. Almost all the lawyers I work with are technology averse. I even explained Ethereum & the potential of smart contracts, response: 'law is too complex'. I'm not really answering your question, just venting some frustration."
2015-12-24 18:42:35;EB110 – James D’Angelo: Satoshi's Big Mistake And The Centralization Of Bitcoin;Good points. Bottomline: Every system (IT-systems but also social systems) tends to centralize eventually, even bitcoin. Centralization is a risk undermining the essence of a PUBLIC blockchain system. Core design criterium should be decentralization even if this compromizes other design criteria. One proposed solution by James D'Angelo includes having different mining incentives like rotating/alternating PoW, PoS and Proof of Identity/Reputation schemes or even elected miners. Do the addressed risks apply to Ethereum? Does this not critique PoS/Casper as much as it critiques Bitcoin (which IMO is an argument to take it seriously)?

2016-01-07 15:07:42;How can the blockchain act as legal title?;"Similar to photographing a newspaper next to a drawing from a patent to prove that you had done the drawing on the date that the newspaper was published, the blockchain creates an irrevocable history which can be used to verify that information occurred on a particular date.

Thus information about a transaction or contract can be stored on the blockchain and it can be known with certainty that it occurred on the claimed date or with the other Identities involved in the transaction.

Since any court would still required the standard documentation of ownership, the core idea is mainly that the blockchain provides added transparency.  

The blockchain is simply a public ledger that shows a transaction where funds and/or ownership change hands.  It's still up to the conventional legal system to enforce these types of contracts.

For digital goods, the blockchain contract can become a form of DRM. 

Protecting against insolvency is a very interesting question.  With a smart contract (such as on Ethereum and I believe also on some sidechains) you could verify control of some balance of currency, and use it to verify solvency by recreating a balance sheet.  

Since all conventional financial statements can be generated from a company's ledger, if a company puts all its transactions on the blockchain, you can get a snapshot of its cash flow.  With smart contracts, you can also get a balance sheet showing liabilities and receivables, etc.  

Since smart contracts are very robust, in theory you could design an institution to run its ledger on the blockchain and use smart contracts for all money flows.  The weak point then becomes external verification of key information.  Did the seller hand the keys to buyer?  How to do we know?  We must somehow provide that input to the smart contract before it can execute the next step.

Conventional systems using GAAP accounting, banks, insurance companies, etc., all have extensive regulatory oversight and risk capital requirements.  Generally firms concentrate a variety of market risks and banks concentrate systemic risk. Both kinds of risk is somewhat regulated, but firms are generally allowed to partially fail (bankruptcy law) and banks are allowed to totally fail (bailouts).

So any system on the blockchain that wishes to leverage capital in a risky way must have some way of sorting things out if events do not go as planned.  Banks leverage deposits by issuing loans.  Can a bank on the blockchain do that?  Yes, but if it wishes to use leverage then the smart contracts have to essentially do the same thing as the laws governing conventional banks.

There is a tremendous transparency advantage to putting it all on the blockchain (ledger, outstanding contracts, etc.,) but the underlying mechanisms of the financial products involved don't really change. There is still market risk and systemic risk which everyone loves to ignore.

That said, if all major financial institutions used a public ledger and smart contracts, it would have been possible to see the over-leveraged nature of the industry pre-2008 and for all of the implicit assumptions to be quantified in a transparent way.

Since this kind of thing is harmful to banks competitive advantage, none would want transparency.

Also, the overall trend has been to shift more risk onto taxpayers and less onto banks themselves.  This makes it harder for a blockchain based system to compete head to head on price, so it may take a few more financial shocks to nudge the public into buying into the aspects of the blockchain that are superior.
Yes, people are looking at it. For example, using a blockchain to transfer title in a security is permissible, at least in the US (assuming that the company is incorporated in DE and the company has adopted bylaws that permit uncertificated securities) -- although there are some nuanced points that need to be thought through.  See the paper from my colleague, Jeanne Schroeder, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2649441.

It also should be permissible, at least in the US, to use a blockchain to record title in other forms of intangible assets (such as chattel paper).  See this article from Juliet Moringiello, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2657551

These articles touch on questions about insolvency.  At least in the US, perfected security interests help govern issues of bankruptcy, insolvency, etc.  Both of these papers presciently note that a blockchain would be great way to update the aging registration systems for security interests in the US.

In terms of title to IP, recording authorship information on a blockchain will likely be useful but will not convey full legal benefits.  In the realm of copyright, recording title in a blockchain may be evidence of ownership and could be used to encode information related to licensing, etc.  However, to enjoy the full benefits of copyright law, there must be affirmative documents filed with the Copyright Office.

A similar conclusion holds for trademark.  Registering evidence of trademark use could help solidify common law trademark rights, but to enjoy nationwide rights there would need to be formal filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Many of these title questions are going to be resolved by closely examining existing laws and by working with governments to update these laws, as necessary.  Take a look at the Digix protocol for creation of onchain tokens backed by offchain gold.  Essentially, they have made the creation of a ""warehouse receipt"" which is a legal document of title intrinsically involve the issuance of an Ethereum on chain token.  Under their system, the token is the receipt.  The proof is in the pudding so, it remains to be seen how it works when a token key is lost, or someone sues a token holder for their assets.  Digix has some key-recovery function which could wind up with them being legally attached to the title.  Another issue on using BlockChain for governments

2016-01-07 08:14:31;In what ways could Law Firms utilise Ethereum and smart contracts?;"In a sense smart contracts are an *alternative* to law. For example trusts, wills, organisations could be administered in a provably correct way. However since this is an unknown space with unclear juristiction there will be lots of opportunity for legal firms.

* Consulting on legality of contracts & Dapps 
* Legally correct contracts as a service
* Law firms or courts as named arbitrators within contracts.
* Linking offchain assets / liabilities to onchain ones
* Using ethereum as an evidential immutable record (IPR, proof of contact agreement / proof of ownership)
* Notary & attestationToday I had the pleasure of bringing an older, smart lawyer in my firm to the light of writing smart contracts. He functionally understood how we would do it even if he didn't speak the language, which was encouraging. There's enough establishment and client evidence out there nowadays that I no longer sound crazy.  0. By starting off from Eris' Open Document Monkey concept of inter-law firm coordination.

1. By using the low marginal cost basis of software and automation to make legal services services available to large markets that mighy otherwise not have afforded it.

2. By producing legal agreements that are novel in their combination of rigour and dynamism.

3. By enabling SAAS-like tailour made law.

4. By employing security deposits/prediction market bets as behaviour modifications to produce desirable multi-party outcomes

5. By enabling trustful relationships between entities that otherwise could not cooperate due to strangerliness and lack of funds, distance from law, poor legal or language literacy, short-time restrictions or ephemerality-requirements, durisdictional distance or disparity, conflict, governmental oppression, or a long, fat tail of unmentioned yet deleterious obstacles to peace and prosperity."

For retail store inventory**Primary Voting.** Allowing everyone to participate in the primary process (a US problem) at the same time, regardless of what the political system decides for primary dates.Collateralized loans contracts. 
So let's say you have an asset that you are long, like Ether, but you need USD. So you can loan USD by depositing some Eth into a contract. The terms of the contract could be the USD amount needs to be returned plus half the appreciation in Eth price. So under all circumstances, you must pay back the USD, but if Eth appreciates you also have to pay half the gains, after paying back principles. 

You then deposit Eth + margin into the contract and a counter party deposits USD. The contract monitors price oracles to know when to do what. If Eth appreciates, the contract sells the correct amounts of Eth and sends the USD + profit balance back to the lender and the remainder back to you. If Eth drops to the point where your collateral would not be able to cover it, it sells all the Eth and pays back the USD. 

Speaking of having a contract verify solutions to np problems, and have people solve them, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey–Clarke–Groves_mechanism might be an interesting or useful thing to implement.

Or maybe not. But maybe so.

I think one of the largest reasons it might be impractical is because it is np hard, but because the contract only has to verify solutions, and because it solves a large class of problems of what action to take, it seems like it could be useful?

I'm not sure whether the verifying might still be a bit too expensive wrt gas costs.

If it is, a challenge/response mechanism might work well?

Not sure."

Yes, to you, ether is the real etherIts interesting that you saw Bitcoin as a token for smart contracts. When ever I was exposed to Bitcoin it was usually described as 'digital money' and I rarely saw any mention of smart contracts. Although I did see mentions of 'programmable money' - which I guess is quite similar to the idea of smart contracts.

So as you say, Ethereum is designed specifically for 'smart contacts' and hence it is natural that it is usually referred to as a token for that purpose. Also I think that the Ethereum foundation deliberately tried to avoid marketing Ethereum as a 'crypto-currency' since they didn't was Ethereum to become merely a token for speculation and instead wanted more attention from developers to build a smart contract ecosystem. So I think it is a good thing that people like you see Ether as a token for smart contracts first and foremost, since that is where most of Ethereum's utility lies.>Bitcoin was marketed and seen pretty quickly as a currency. Ethereum is not marketed like that.

> A number of narratives about why it may be empowering for people in less developed countries has emerged [...]

Listen here, mister Bredd Scott, if you will ever read this. Listen and repeat after me. Bitcoin (or Ether) can empower the poor by potentially forcing the state to use non-inflationary currency. State is the biggest enemy of the poor. Taking the currency supply control from the hands of the state necessarily and immediately benefits most citizens, especially the poor.

>  It is one thing to use Bitcoin to provide a counter-power to the 
powerful cartels of banks in nations like the United States, but in a country like Zimbabwe the real need may be to strengthen the integrity of the banking system, something that can only be achieved by hard, long-term political battles.

State. In both cases, state control is the culprit. You can't possibly loosen state control over the banks with ""political battle"". There is no need for state control altogether. Either local banks will provide service that citizens need, or some smart contract running on a network. No need for long hard battles.

See this discussion:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/55

tldr: There are two kinds of address types in Ethereum, [hexidecimal and ICAP](https://gavofyork.gitbooks.io/turboethereum/content/ethkey.html). Vitalik has a proposal for a way to add checksums to hex addresses using capitalization of the letters in the address. ICAP addresses already have built in check sum support, so there is [discussion going on](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/55) about whether to deprecate hex addresses in favor of ICAP that have some benefits besides check sums. At the same time, geth is planning on adding ICAP support.Let's start off by clarifying what a checksum is, because I don't think a lot of people fully understand it. 

Let's take an address of 0x12345. You would add up all the numbers (1+2+3+4+5 = 15) and then add (1+5) together to get 6 so your final address would be 0x12345*6*. Then, if you sent to 0x323434, it would fail because the checksum wouldn't pass.

Now, if Ethereum would be to implement checksums, all the existing addresses would **fail the checksums** and it would be an utter clusterfuck / disaster. 

I just don't understand how this is going to work out. Maybe I'm missing some crucial piece of information?

related -- https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/425js8/maybe_we_should_reconsider_checksums_as_default/

Edit: okay I found this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3vxhul/eli5_how_do_a_simple_user_work_around_the_no/

1. ""Solution"" 1 -- the address identicon which most places have implemented. [Here it is on etherchain](https://etherchain.org/account/0x7cb57b5a97eabe94205c07890be4c1ad31e486a8)

2. Solution 2 -- ""Addresses have 40 characters. We can add extra characters that will checksum the others and any client that won't support can ignore the extra characters"". This sounds like an insane undertaking as well. "
2016-02-25 23:55:23;Etheropt, a decentralized options exchange, is seeking testnet users;"I'm here to announce **Etheropt**, a decentralized options exchange built on Ethereum. The options listed are binary call options on the price of Ethereum in USD as reported by Poloniex and Coindesk and verified by Reality Keys. Etheropt has no owner. Its entire operation is described and executed by an Ethereum smart contract.

Today, I'm releasing a [testnet version of Etheropt](http://etherboost.github.io/etheropt/testnet). Please play with it! Get a feel for it, try to crash it, etc. There is some light [documentation](http://etherboost.github.io/etheropt/manual) you can read. The mainnet version of Etheropt will be released at a later date.

If you don't have a testnet account yet, go here to make an address: [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). Then reply or send me a message and I'll send you some testnet Ether. If you have Geth running in RPC mode, Etheropt will connect to it. Otherwise, it will use the API provided by Etherscan to call functions and send transactions.Cool!

Thoughts on adding CFDs? I feel that CFDs are much more useful for hedging and even trading than binary bets. A simple scheme with strike price, buyer collateral, seller collateral and leverage would suffice; to increase liquidity you could try to standardize collateral requirements so as to make liquidation prices powers of two or something similar.Neat! I'm a fan of [binary options too](http://cdetr.io/smart-markets/). Using them as done here means payoffs and losses are bounded, ensuring that the option seller can post sufficient collateral up-front. Bounded losses make binary options better suited for on-chain contracts than conventional options, because with conventional options the seller (aka writer) has unbounded losses and so would need to keep posting more and more collateral/margin to pay the buyer's gains as it moves further and further in-the-money. If you implement the token standard to support dai, and use oraclize/realitykeys, you could make options for any asset: gold, oil, Apple, DJIA, etcI'm trying sells and buys on the testnet, with the suggested prices, and nothing is happening. I can't see any order book to verify if my orders are having an effect. I am doing it via Mist.Looks great - will try it out this weekend. At a first look at the contract/documentation I did not find fees mentioned. "

    netstat -an | grep 30303

You should see connections where the 30303 is on the right and where 30303 is on the left. (incoming and outgoing)

> Do I need to configure any port forwarding?

Depends on the above. By default, geth can traverse uPnP routers. If it's not working, you can either check on your router to make sure uPnP is turned on, or configure TCP/UDP 30303 to be forwarded.

2016-03-10 21:43:12;Crating a token on ethereum and then increasing token amount later?;"Tokens are just smart contracts so you can code in any logic you want.

For example if the federal reserve was a smart contract they would have a method called PrintMoney that adds 1 trillion to the governments balance.Sure, when you make a token you're just making a contract, which holds data on who owns how much. If you want to add more tokens later, just put a function in the script that lets you do that. The tutorials on ethereum.org will tell you everything you need.Contracts are immutable. You'd need to have a function to do that before you deploy your token contract.Lol @ the Federal Reserve comment.  But really you'd have to code that 'change to 2 million' function into the smart contract right off the bat and people could see it (if you showed them the validated source which they would probably like to see.)"

You are running a full node. That is what Mist is. If you don't want to run a full node then that is fine. But you don't need make a reddit post about it. Ethereum is brand spanking new and under heavy development. New features to the clients are being pushed daily.

Next iteration: the democratic Ponzi.  The people who currently have money locked up in a Ponzi, can spend a percentage of the money locked up as a marketing budget for the Ponzi: they vote for the best proposals to be carried out, e.g. to pay someone to build a website around the Ponzi, to buy advertising etc...

Since it is in their interest to attract new participants (if they want to exit the Ponzi with a profit), they will choose and spend money on the best marketing efforts.  On the other hand, they must not spend too much, since the more money that will be burnt on marketing, the more skewed the Ponzi will be, and the less attractive to new entrants.

I also think he is right on this.

Having validated miners who are voted in to batch and secure transactions would scale immensely and remain decentralised, more decentralised than bitcoin has ever been to date. It would also maintain current individual transaction anonymity.

But how would the voting take place? That seems like an impossible scenario to handle unless changes to the protocol are made. Which will never happen because miners would never allow that as it kills their entire business model. If we cant even raise the blocksize to 2mb how could this change ever take place.

Dont want to sound like an ETH cheerleader but Vitalik is heading in the right direction with POS aka proof of escrow (casper).

2016-03-31 20:10:03;What does /r/ethereum think of Hyperledger and Digital Asset Holdings?;"Blockchains require a cryptocurrency token to be economically really interesting.Let's separate out Digital Asset and the whole Hyperledger project.

1. Digital Asset is a pretty focused project (for now).  They are engaging in Very Large Projects with financial industry utilities.  E.g., Australian Stock Exchange and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation as you say.  There is plenty of blockchain space which is not DAH.

2. Hyperledger, even though DAH contributed the name and is involved actively, is a consortium including financial, technology, consulting, and academic partners.  It isn't going to go anywhere fast, even if IBM, Blockstream and DAH are trying to lead it.  Just as a ""for instance"": IC3 is a member, and their rather prestigious collection of Directors recently published a ""On Scaling the Decentralized Blockchain"" http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf
It suggests a sweeping redesign of blockchains to allow scale.  So there are a lot of competing ideas there.  It could wind up being very helpful, important and even ""compete"" with Ethereum.  In the long run.  But right now, IBM, Fujitsu, R3, Wells Fargo, and 26 other organizations have no idea of what ""space"" they are aimed at.
Hyperledger/ DAH are focused on centralised blockchains no? If your worried about permissioned blockchains then you are screwed, even IBM have one on their website now.

If you understand how and why the world WILL have atleast one global open public decentralised permissionless blockchain, then all you need to focus on is btc or eth.I think they will go with a permissioned consortium chain, as banks and big financial institutions can not have everyone and their mom see all their transactions and play around with contracts at the same level as they do.

As you said, with their celebrity status (and probably their money / political buying power) they probably can push it a long way, but in the end, nothing goes over a permissionless, open blockchain like Ethereum or Bitcoin

Think in the future we'll have a few big public open blockchains and many thousand private ones, possibly interacting with the public ones.Hyperledger is a nicely done project. Just that it only has tokens but doesn't have scripting. That is - you can have Unicorn tokens there, but you can't build a Unicorn Grinder.

Also, the community around it is far smaller as far as I know. 

Finally, I'm not sure what their business model is - how will they finance the development in the future? From donations?

Still, I wouldn't be surprised if they take some part of the cake. "

2016-04-28 21:37:56;We shouldnt want DAOs to replace early VC funding, but rather later stage funding (x-post /ethtrader;"I assume this is pointed at the DAO that is going to be Deployed soon that Slock.it has chosen to give it's proposal too :-)

I have to agree with /u/semiel I think this is a both and thing, only time will tell on this as it is a completely new way for humans to organize.

(cross posting)
We (Slock.it) are a different breed of company, with a unique project. We want to build an open source Universal Sharing Network; we think that makes us a perfect fit for early stage support from a DAO, as the DAO is a pivotal piece of the Network we are building. 

We have had working prototypes since October, and instead of seeking venture capital right then and there, we decided to combine two of our dreams: Dao-ify the world and Decentralize the Sharing Economy. We think there are a lot of synergies between the 2 dreams because a DAO can build a open-source permission-less network better than a traditional Company can.

Other proposals to the DAO will likely be series B or C funding rounds for the companies... check out Mobotiq: https://daohub.org/proposals.html[deleted]http://i.imgur.com/QeFcE.jpgIn reality it is more likely to replace an A round. You don't want to open yourself up to that many investors right at the start, and the market is far too small and uncertain to support a company at any later stage than that. Remember that the majority of any company's costs are in regular fiat money, so a DAO where the money is locked in ETH (or another digital asset) in a contract is extremely risky and a bad financial decision.

Going back to the late stage funding - IPOs are becoming less popular, and the public markets are hugely liquid. Startups today are incentivised to stay private longer, not go public earlier.

I would be HUGELY skeptical of any late stage company raising money from cryptoequity as it really has to be seen as the last resort. If you choose a decentralised cryptoequity exchange for your IPO over a large regulated exchange it says more to me about the trustworthiness of the company at hand than it does about technology."

2016-04-28 18:52:42;An Introduction to Cryptoeconomics and Futarchy experiments on Gnosis;"An Introduction to Cryptoeconomics and Futarchy experiments on Gnosis

Over the next few months we will be running several experiments on the Gnosis prediction market platform thanks to a generous Ethereum DEV grant. These experiments will test cryptoeconomic hypothesis and methods related to market manipulations and Futarchy and were inspired by Vitalik’s reddit post on Empirical Cryptoeconomics. Each experiment consists of a market on Gnosis, a smart contract or set of smart contracts outputting some value to settle the markets, and shares that will be auctioned off and provide an incentive for manipulators to shift market values away from their expected outcomes. These experiments provide a profit opportunity for both manipulating and non-manipulating users. In addition to manipulators’ potential profits, non-manipulating users will be provided arbitrage opportunities by driving the prices back to their expected outcome. Later experiments will test the ability for prediction markets to be used for Futarchy.

Our first experiment will begin in the next few weeks and will test manipulators ability to push a market which will verifiably resolve to 5 above this value. These initial experiments will gauge how easy (or hard) it is for a group of participants with special interests (in this case the manipulation token holders) to manipulate a market in order to sway the decision of an oracle. There are two primary cases in which such manipulation may be used: futarchy markets (or other processes) for organization decision, and oracle processes which involve markets to determine oracle outcome. In each case, groups may have a direct monetary incentive to change market outcomes.

This experiment will consist of three components:

    10,000 manipulation shares will be auctioned in 1,000 share chunks over a 3 day period.
    A smart contract coded to return 5. This will be used to resolve the market.
    A scalar market with the range (0,10) which will run for one week.

We will begin with the auction of 10,000 manipulation shares. These shares will be sold in 1,000 share chunks. Following the markets closure, these shares will be redeemable for between 0 and 0.1 Eth depending upon the average value of the prediction market shares. This redemption value will be calculated by ((avg market value) — 5)/50. For example, if the market price remains at 5 for the entire period these shares will redeem for 0 and if the market remains at 10 for the entire period, they will redeem for 0.1. Redemption value will be calculated proportionally between these prices. At this time we will also submit the resolution contract for review.

Three days following this, we will launch the market on Gnosis. This will be a scalar market with a range of (0,10). This market will be resolved by the contract which will verifiably return 5. Everyone is open and encouraged to participate in this market. Whenever the market value is above 5 there is a guaranteed profit opportunity for users who have not purchased manipulation shares. Following market resolution, manipulation shares will be redeemable calculated by the average value over the market’s duration.

Expect a post here in the next few weeks announcing experiment dates, and please visit our forum at http://forum.groupgnosis.com/ for more discussion!

TL;DR:

    Gnosis Prediction Market experiments testing market manipulation and Futarchy, funded by Ethereum DEV grant
    First experiment, market resolves to 5, manipulators push market above 5 for profit. Other users profit by pushing back to 5.

Paging /u/adiiorioIf you just want a very secure wallet and not necessarily hardware, consider https://www.ether.li/ - they have an excellent (dare I say perfect?) model with 2-out-of-3 multisig trustless keystore, where they provide one of the signatures with 2fa.

2016-05-12 23:18:47;Is myetherwallet centralized service?;"I can only shed some light on MyEtherWallet. 

We have exactly 1 geth node and exactly 1 cloudflare account that we have for ssl (on MyEtherWallet.com) and caching/ddos protection. 

The frontend code you see is served directly from the gh-pages branch on github. 

That's it. No typical servers. No databases. Our geth node looks just like yours. If our geth node was hacked or anything was intercepted between your browser and the node, literally nothing would happen. The intercepter would know the balance of an account or receive a signed transaction (which no one can do anything with except... Send the transaction... which is what you wanted to do in the first place... And only if they put their version of your signed transaction thru before it went thru on our node. Lol.)

The geth node is there for a total of 6 calls now. 

1. We recieve the balance of the account when you access it. We then grab the balance in usd, btc, and euro from the coinmarketcap API. 

2. We receive the balance of digix tokens when you access an account on the digix page. 

3. We receive the balance of the dao tokens when you access an account on the dao page. 

4. We receive the nonce of an account when you send a transaction or press the button on step 1 of the offline transaction tab. 

5. We receive the current gas price when you send a transaction or press the button on step 1 of the offline transaction tab. 

6. We broadcast the signed transaction on the dao page, digix page, send transaction page, and offline transaction page. 

Those bits of data are the only information that goes in or out of your computer when you are on MyEtherWallet and they are all done when you take an action. We don't know anything regarding private keys, those are all decrypted by your browser, or created and encrypted by your computer. We cant access your funds, nor are your funds stored with us. They are stored on the blockchain and accessible with the randomly generated private key that never leaves your browser. 

We store nothing. We save none of it. We have no analytics. We can't tell you how many wallets have been generated or transactions have been sent or who sent them or anything. 

When you email me bc you forgot your password, I can offer no help. When you have a question about a transaction, I look on etherscan.io. When you don't save your private key, I cannot do anything. 

Everything else is done by your browser in your browser. 

You can run it locally if you want, which would cut out githubs servers and cloudflare. You could use the kvhnuke.github.io URL to cut out cloudflare. 

I'm not sure how we could make it more decentralized besides forcing you all to run your own geth node to get / do those actions I listed above. But then you would have to sync the node and if you are going to sync a node, you should use Mist bc they have the ability to save wallets and interact with contracts and all that other fun stuff. 

If we were to disappear with our geth node in tow, someone would have to start up a new geth node, change a few lines in the repo, and you would be up and running again. 

You can run the generate pages and offline pages completely offline to generate the signed transaction, but you would need to find the nonce and gas price from somewhere else and then use another service to broadcast the signed transaction. I believe etherscan.io has a page for that. Send transaction obviously doesn't work as it needs the gas price and nonce. 

We are just two people. I work in my pajamas most do the time my apartment. Kvhnuke does in his apartment, when he's not at school or work. No offices. No funding. No VC. Just whatever donations people send and the thank you email we occasionally get. Myetherwallet is centralized, but who cares? It is just a convenient thin layer around fundamental blockchain transactions. The moment myetherwallet goes down, you would be able to do all the same with Mist, or whatever other wallet that would allow you to import private key. Myetherwallet is only important as an early ecosystem nice-to-have service, but it is not crucial in any way whatsoever.아톰님,  myetherwallet 은 central 서비스는 아니고, 그냥 app 과 feature 가 copy to client 인 서비스로 생각합니다.

The Reddit model allows discussions to be easily manipulated I agree that the DAO needs some type of forum to communicate and discuss.

the account name will be your public key for the account that holds dao tokens, you must have an ethereum address owning dao tokens to speak. Possibly also creating a user name and that user name can own multiple public keys.

Not sure on this one, but considering that your token holdings will be listed as well. This has benefits, and it has pitfalls. These should be weighed. I'm thinking it's a good idea.

The source of the forum should be decentralized. It could be done on ipfs, it could be done on whisper, and it could be done on swarm.

It should allow private messaging, blocking of private messages from users, public topic specific forums and private group communication. Nobody who holds dao tokens can be blocked from any public discussion, and no discussions on proposals can be private, although me and my friends or you and your friends can chat about them privately if we like.

It should also support time based discussions and reminders. So there could be a proposal discussion that starts the day a proposal goes up for vote, and everyone would get a reminder.

Right now, doing this on Reddit is great while we are still in creation. In 33 hours it will change to a discussion involving tons of people who have no business discussing internal decisions of the DAO. That's like letting foreigners lobby the government."

2016-06-23 23:08:27;If we soft fork and 15% of the Supply is lost forever;"> If you truly believe in Ethereum long term, why not take a small haircut now for the greater good of the system by not hard forking

How is that for the greater good of the system? It's for the greater good of ETH speculators who had no intention of reinvesting in projects that actually drive mainstream adoption further. 

Having 15% of the ETH supply that was dedicated purely to reinvesting into the ecosystem lost forever is a huge blow to Ethereum. I'm open to a rational argument against this but I've yet to find a convincing one. If the DAO smart contract can become fundamentally fixed and/or relaunched in some way (all known security holes patched up), and all salvaged ether returned to the DTHs, it can still use the remaining funds to support real projects and, hopefully, begin churning out investment related profits which will be added back into the pool. If the DAO begins operating again, the base value of DAO tokens could go up with the supply cut (+/- how sour the investors are), the ether price would have a similar effect, unless the DAO issues more DAO tokens for some reason (I don't know why it would, greed is good? the tokens will still trade and price discovery will begin to reflect DAO performance), in that case, the base value of DAO tokens should be worth less whatever % of real money was lost, and then the market decides from there. Clearly there are a lot of ifs here. One way or another, the DTHs need to be made whole if we're going to move along with the experiment, the decentralized experiment anyway. The more that current DTHs are betrayed, the more centralized the system would become if it were to move forward and use that money.Sound logic, at least from the purely economic point of view. However:

* Higher price per ETH is only very remotely relevant to the greater good of the system. Ethereum is, first and foremost, an engine for decentralised applications, and, only secondly, a cryptocurrency. i.e. the 15% reduction in total supply should be orthogonal to mainstream adoption

* Legal suits. We don't want anyone, *even Slock.it*, to be investigated by the SEC, which is bound to happen if the money is not returned to the investors. The legal fallout could be tremendous and very hard to contain. Returning the money should, at least to some extent, smooth things out.

* Precedent. Contrary to some folks' beliefs that the hard fork would ""ruin the philosophy"" of ""unstoppable code"", I firmly believe that it will communicate the message to the current and future users of Ethereum, that if something very wrong happens at large scale again, the victims will be not left alone to suffer, but the community will be able to come together and right the wrongs.

* Finally, the ecosystem. A minor point, but I, personally, put some money in The DAO out of the belief that it will help moving the ecosystem forward by funding a new generation of projects which would not even be possible without the existence of The DAO. Heck, I was even working on one and planning to create a proposal for it. Now it's dead :( I'm still hoping, though, that at least some of the rescued money will be reinvested in the ecosystem.

If everyone in the world put all their money in a DAO,  the top 1% would still control the majority.  If that money was stolen,  everyone would be broke,  and everyone would want their money back. No one could ""afford those losses"". DAO token ownership, like Ether, Bitcoin or Dollar ownership will obey a power law distribution. It's a characteristic which manifests not only in wealth distribution, but in virtually all large complex systems one way or another. 

Even if this claim were true—which it isn't for the reasons outlined by /u/punkycoldmedina—it would never be a remotely reasonable argument to allow a theft to stand.

You are aware that the people with the most money are the ones investing the most in the ecosystem, building projects and creating jobs, right? But yeah—fuck those guys.Exactly. Too much self-interest.

2016-06-30 21:24:05;Fork Vote by Ether commitment, version 2.;"We just went through this ordeal where DAO token holders were subjected to loss and scrutiny because so many were incapable of reading and understanding the smart contracts. They relied on influential people in the space who said all looked good. They relied on the curator list which had VB amongst other trusted names. Then the smart contract failed. These people were ridiculed and were told they should have done better due dilligence. I don't see how the proper solution is telling them to blindly put their funds in another smart contract to be locked up for an amount of time when their ability to read the code hasn't change. A simple vote i get - this locking mechanism is senseless to me. I won't sell and I'm here long term, but I don't want to put my funds in code I can't understand in order to show my loyalty. It's not an effective vote unless you stand to gain if you are right and lose if you are wrong. The real vote can only happen on a prediction market, such as a futures market in originalETH and forkedETH. I really like the idea of splitting off individual contracts for each voter that they control, which avoids the ""custodial"" aspect of smart contracts, a big risk. 

In all good consciousness, I can't lock my entire Eth holdings in a smart contract. I would lock some, but not a majority of it.

I think this is the best solution from a policy point of view. But from a pragmatic point of view me (and I assume many other members of the community) are not in the mood to trust our entire eth holdings to a contract.i think this proposal has unintended side effects and carries more risk than the mining consensus alternative, since no one really wants their ether locked up for long periods of time.

it also discourages trading/spending/using, which is the lifeblood of exchanges - and merchants  - payment processors etc- which may mean they have a vested interest to discourage voting and also not participate in any votes themselves.

it reduces the velocity of ether, which depresses its value.

and most importantly it creates massive predictable downwards price events when lockups expire (just like on the stock market after the ipo of a company whose shareholders have signed a lockup agreement).  the moment that the funds are unlocked - for instance, at the 3 month deadline is a massive cliff where a lot of ether would be sold at the same time. this would encourage shorting and a downwards price spiral culminating in a specific moment that a lot of ether gets unlocked and sold - the exact moment the price is guaranteed to crash!

this proposed mechanism seems to have too many unintended side effects, and i still believe its simpler and less divisive to leave the consensus voting to the miners as they did with the soft fork.  any other system can be gamed too much. 

personally, if i had a vote it would be to hard fork and get it over with as soon as possible, then get back to work on building value and a good ethereum ecosystem.  improve the tools and techniques to allow future smart contracts to be more robust and trusted than they are at this time.

There is a strong incentive to not vote - since you don't have to lock up your ether especially if it looks like your favored chain is going to win. Then the vote could be vulnerable to a huge surge at the end of voting period that might not allow all to participate. I remember the DAO was dealing with a similar problem. As a supporter of the fork, I just wanted to say thank you, knowing that you are not a fan of the idea. 

Whether the community decides to go with this coin vote , or a decision based on hash power , this decision will be made in a decentralized manner . 

I trust the foundation to code the fork securely and correctly , and I strongly believe that the community will grow immensely from this entire ordealthanks for you contribution! We need those mechanisms.Thank you for putting together and outlining how it would work.Thats awesome work! Thanks for that. Definitely a better way to vote than reddit upvotes ;)To ask us to put up more Ether to vote as  collateral is just ridiculous.  To ask us to vote again is ridiculous as well since we already have voted.  I'm not going to commit any more Ether to any voting contracts anytime soon.  Why? 1.   It just seems like too much risk especially after the first major failed contract.  2.  We already voted via hashrate and that is lower risk than using Coin for collateral in a contract.

We've already voted for a fork, its time for you guys to implement a fork to mitigate this attack.   Otherwise, I think I am going to be done with Ethereum as well as 50-80% of the Ethereum community.I think this is a bad idea. People don't want to lock their ETH in a contract.

We already have a consensus mechanism for blockchains and we will use it and don't need to invent new ones. Just fork it, the miners will conduct votes and do the right thing, we need this damn nightmare over with.This seems like a distraction to me.  Ethereum has a consensus mechanism and it will be used.  This is the type of tactic that allows a minority to attempt to prevent an action by the majority. (aka blockstream 101)What's your opinion on proof of stake then? Is it wise for Ethereum to pursue Casper?I posted on your gist, but I'm not sure if that sends you a notification, so I'll also post it here:

    // if there is enough support activate the lock
    if (minerSupport > 2000)
        active = true;
    // if there is an overwhelming support, deactivate the lock
    else if (minerSupport < 4000)
        active = false;

Maybe I'm missing something, but why are you checking if miner support is less than 4000? And why is it an else-if? If it's not greater than 2000, it's definitely less than 4000. :PGreat idea IF all ethereum developers can get behind it and guarantee the code is bug free. 

Also why is the maximum just 3 months? Please make it at least one year for the true holders!Nice work Alex, I disagree with your decision to make a contract per person though. Sooner or later we'll need to solve the problem of wealthy contracts. Dear Alex,

I have been following the project and your work for a while. I appreciate that you are spending the time to try to create a platform for decentralized consensus to vote on the hardfork/no fork issue.

I am philosophically opposed to a hardfork, and I only hold 1 ether worth of DAO tokens (meaning: I don't care at all about it), because I thought the DAO was a terrible investment (but I wanted to participate in the experience nonetheless to better understand it).

Over the last days, I have been rather annoyed by some dogmatic and biased DAO token holders who would do anything to get their money back, instead of taking responsibility for their poor decision.

I was pro soft-fork to censor the funds without hardfork, but this isn't an option anymore. Or I would also be okay with the attacker getting some money (but not too much) and giving back the rest to the DAO token holders: this is the simplest option, and it could all be done natively using smart contracts; but I doubt it will happen.

Unfortunately, I believe that using another smart contract to lock ETH token holders' funds in order to vote creates a very dangerous situation: what if there is a bug in the contract? That would be terrible. Also it creates another centralization risk, where a lot of ether will be in the same contract; or at least with the same code (it's a really bad idea for people to code their own).
The risk is simply too high for me, even though I don't plan on moving my ether anytime soon. This is why the quorum will likely be too low, so I'm afraid it won't really be a good indicator of the general consensus on the issue.

For me, the worst scenario would be the attacker getting 15% of the ether; it's very likely the worst outcome for the price of ether, and also the worst outcome for the public perception of Ethereum.

This is why I hope we will hardfork, but I'll be fine either way. Ethereum will survive this in any case.Thanks for your work on this. Adversity is certainly spurring a lot of interesting innovation.We will vote by commitment to upgrade and the network will split. If you insist on changing the protocol and ignoring the yellow paper that is the only realistic result.Give us a 100% guarantee that if this contract also fucks up that we will get everything including the stolen DAO tokens back via hard fork and I would support this. Isn't the optimum strategy for a non-DAO holder, to simply allow the fork to proceed, and thereby gain a stake in both chains? 

Both have good claims to succeed in the marketplace -  the one that doesn't reward 'hackers', and the one that guarantees finality/enforcement etc.Hi avsa. Great work. I have a few questions before I can determine whether or not this is a good course of action.

How might we use the results of this vote to determine if we have quorum? Perhaps total Ether locked / total Ether in circulation > .5? And what happens if we don't achieve that quorum? 

I see this system as a signaling mechanism to help determine whether or not a majority supports the fork. I worry that a non-quorum result wouldn't be a good signal, and can't be used to infer the actual results of the fork. 

Moreover, what do we do if it's a ""contested vote"", even if we achieve a quorum? For example, say the results are 52% yes and 48% no. Won't this be disaster for a hard fork, since it promotes infighting as to what the ""real"" Ethereum is? 

Thanks!If Ethereum is decentralized, the most any vote can do is provide miners a measure of community sentiment.  Voting would be not be meaningless, but it also would not be binding.  Ultimately, this decision will be made by hash power.

A lot of thought is going into the rules of this vote, which is great, but the rules of the vote only really matter if the community feels it can only have one vote.  Since any vote would only be informing miners of community sentiment (not directing miners what to do), there is nothing wrong with having multiple votes.  Different types of votes using different rules would only help provide miners with more information.

I think it could be interesting to hold multiple votes under multiple rules.  What rules would produce the vote that most favors no fork?  What rules would produce the vote that most favors a fork?  Seeing which rules each side chooses to bias their vote could be extremely informative.

Of course my argument relies on Ethereum being truly decentralized.  I doubt that it is.  I think these votes are being proposed because exchanges, mining pools, and dapp developers can only fork gracefully if they do it in a coordinated fashion.Enlighten me please, are we speaking about another DAO fund here?Curious about this piece of code:

     if (startTimer + 24 hours < now) {
            // if there is enough support activate the lock
            if (minerSupport > 2000)
                active = true;
            // if there is an overwhelming support, deactivate the lock
            else if (minerSupport < 4000)
                active = false;

If minerSupport is under 2000, then it will always be under 4000. This doesn't make sense to me. We need sybil-proof blockchain identities methinks. Until then users will have to accept that core will hold a lot of power. Alex,

I personally disagree with the time-voting, but I am sure other people will provide good arguments for and against. 

However, I don't understand why you are so adamant in having time-voting in version 1.0 of the voting system.

Remove the time-voting feature and then we can immediately put the voting contract into use without too much controversy. You can always add time-locking feature later. Start simple.

Currently we have nothing at all, not even pure coin voting. We only have a forum where whoever is the loudest gets the attention, and as you said yourself it's impossible to determine what the true consensus is. Coin voting will at least separate real Ether holders from the rest, and then we can debate on how the voting system can be further improved.


Time-locking is experimental in nature, and is unusual practice as far as voting systems are concerned. Please provide us tried and tested solutions first, because we have nothing.

Because voting is not binding, I don't see any harm in trying something simple first.Wow, can i vote to kick you out of Ethereum Foundation ? 

I say we let the miners decide - if 51% of mining power wants a fork - fork it is... 51% of mining power can manipulate the blockchain, if we do what they do not agree to -  ethereum is done.

EDIT: I would just like to add that your proposal is flawed in many ways - I cant lock my ether - i live off crypto. I exchange ether for fiat to pay for day-to-day expenses. "

Because coin votes seem to be working Pretty well for DASH.;"...and here it is: http://carbonvote.com/Love this.DASH is an excellent cryptocurrency with a wonderful community. That being said, DASH has a ""masternode"" layer that makes it a better fit for this type of coin voting. In DASH, masternode operators are separate from miners, like a separate layer on top of a Bitcoin style currency. Masternode owners vote on proposals to fund things like development, communications, and other initiatives. A precedent was set up a long time ago that masternode operators would be the deciding voice in the DASH community and they use voting to fund development and solve issues. DASH went through some rough times itself (the name change from Darkcoin to DASH was an intense community affair!) and has stuck it out and iterated it's governance structures over time.

Ethereum does not have a ""masternode"" layer that has a precedent of solving these difficult ecosystem issues we face.

We are also curating a list of Ethereum’s finest web dapps to recommend to our early users. We are especially looking for dapps near launch or in early beta, so if your dapp is MetaMask compatible, let us know, so it can be included on our list!Spectacular work, MetaMask team. That's exactly what I needed today! Well done.. :)I'm truly impressed with this. I imagined that a type of DNScoin or WWWcoin would be made and experimented on before something like this occurred.

I do have some questions.

What type of encryption is being used when storing the key in the Chrome browser? Is there a way to manual store the key in an alternate location, such as a lockable FOB/USB device? (Possibly this might be a good idea to implement).

I run an assortment of addons with Chrome currently. For example AdBlocker+ and Disconnect. Has your team tested using Metamask with addons yet? It might sound silly but the thought AdBlocker/Disconnect getting in the way of reading info.

I look forward to seeing more work from your team!This is amazing. Keep it up.Fun fact: MetaMask uses the [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) standard to derive its accounts, just like Jaxx does, so you can easily use the same seed phrase between these two apps, and any other BIP-44 compliant wallets.simply...

Great job guys!Amazing...Good work guysPowerful stuff.Amazing stuffHoly Sweet Baby Jesus! This is awesome! And it works!I hope rouleth can check support for your extension before they relaunch :-DThis looks very cool; very polished, very user-friendly. I want to install it right away, but... I have one concern.

When installing MetaMask, Chrome warns users: ""This extension can read and change all your data on the websites you visit."" You address this issue in your introductory blog post:

> In order for MetaMask to enable DApps to access the blockchain, MetaMask injects a web3 Javascript object into each page. The extension is not changing the website, it is simply giving it access to the network in order to function properly.

I've built a Chrome extension before, so I know how alarmist Chrome's permission-warnings can be; there's no distinguishing between an extension which injects a few stylesheet tweaks and one which injects a malicious keylogger. And I trust that the MetaMask developers are all good, ethical people and that the extension does exactly what it promises to do and nothing more. But there is a precedent for extensions [serving adware to users after changing ownership](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/malware-vendors-buy-chrome-extensions-to-send-adware-filled-updates/).

So just for the sake of discussion, imagine that the MetaMask team turns evil. (Why? I dunno, [maybe they hear the woman they love blow-up and then half their face burns off](http://i.imgur.com/p4yoitW.jpg).) What's stopping them from pushing an update which automatically sends the funds in all users' MetaMask wallets directly to the developers? How can users protect themselves against this (admittedly unlikely) scenario?This looks really cool. Will definitely investigate using it on my next project.I even got some free Testnet ETH. How have you managed that? Is it automatically sent to new accounts or are there pre-generated Testnet accounts?/u/danfinlay

*Eth has to be money* or else ""contracts"" don't mean jack. Every Ethereum contract only has utility insofar as it eventually/potentially effects a monetary transaction. Thus a hard fork to undo a confirmed blockchain transaction is just as bad in Ethereum as it would be in Bitcoin or Monero. It is a gigantic failing, and leaves tremendous doubt over the platform's neutrality in its wake, likely for at least a year to come. And if held up as a general policy it is both deadly and pointless, because if it were even useful at all a permissioned ledger would be far superior at the job and would soon overtake it. I strongly disagree with this:

>And again, Ethereum is a contractual system. You can't have successful contractual systems that legitimize theft via the gaming of errors in the underlying contracts. Theft is antithetical to the whole idea of having contracts, so allowing theft via errors in contracts pretty much kills the validity of the entire system - which is why successful contractual systems invalidate contractual stipulations in which errors are used to steal.


Ethereum is a platform on which contractual systems can be built and through which they can interact. Any program can be hosted by Ethereum. The designation of a program as being a contract is a semantic one, that is only subjectively understood by those who recognize it as such. I don't have to recognize any program as a 'contract'. Bitcoin can be emulated on Ethereum as its own smart contract. If the Bitcoin contractual system is insecure, the users of all the other contractual systems on the Ethereum platform should not incur a loss.

The **only** 'contractual system' all Ethereum participants agree to is the protocol. In other words, a bug in the protocol is the only thing that can justify a hacking-instigated HF.

Even looking at all of this only from the economic perspective, HFing any time a smart contract created by some private party is hacked doesn't make sense.

The evolution of the contractual systems on the Ethereum platform will occur more quickly if poorly constructed smart contracts are not saved by HFs. Therefore, under normal circumstances, a HF to reverse a hack of a third party 'contract' would never IMO be economically justified. The only reason I see the DAO hack HF as being justified is that Ethereum's protocol developers did not make it clear enough that smart contracts, the DAO in particular, are highly experimental, and receive none of the security guarantees that the protocol does (in terms of being rescued by a HF in the event of a security vulnerability).

The idea of everyone treating all of the smart contracts on the platform as part of one human interpreted contractual system is totally impractical given what a distributed block chain is attempting to achieve: the maintenance of a rapidly updated shared ledger by a large number un-related parties.

It also misunderstands what a smart contract is. A smart contract is a contract interpreted by computers, rather than people. The entire purpose of relying exclusively on smart contracts is that they can practically be maintained by a group that is very large and mutually untrusting. Injecting social consensus based execution of smart contracts into the system's underlying assumptions nullifies all of the advantages gained by relying on smart contracts that can be automatically interpreted.

Both chains are the same age, both have the same transaction history up until the fork. The DAO-bailout chain has forced a state change, but it is not ""newer"" in any way. Unless you count the HF as a protocol upgrade, but that is not the narrative for either side. The HF was an option because ethereum is early in its development, and because Casper might be a ""clean slate"" with a 100% state-copying premine from ETH.

I support both sides right now. Only around 5% of all Ether participated on [carbonvote.com](http://carbonvote.com). There were a few polls on Twitter too etc, and a change.is petition. It can't be argued that these polls are enough to claim consensus.

What we are seeing now instead is that the market self-organises to show what chain people agree to use, and the miners follow the $$$. That is now an ongoing process, ETC has 1/8 the hash power and 1/8 the $$$. Those who want to can choose the risk-free alternative of keeping duplicate copies on both chains, and ethereum can find consensus through the market trading assets back and forth until one chain wins. 

This is an efficient consensus process with zero risk if you keep the duplicate copies of your stake, and those who want to gamble can do so, and they get rewarded for doing the work of reaching consensus. Is this not better than the polls that were used prior to the fork ?

Please give the detailed the steps for newbies. thx.Well I may have screwed up good. I followed that guide to a T, being hella careful and triple checking both addresses were correct and in the correct places. 

Sent one ether as a test and it worked great, showing up a couple minutes later in my unforked wallet on a different machine. Cool, so without changing anything except the amount to send, I entered the entire balance of the wallet (minus the first one and a few tenths for gas). Waiting, waiting. For some reason it never showed up, even after a ton of confirmations. 

Then it dawned on me. After the fork (but before pologate) I had bought some more ETH and naturally added it to my main (forked) wallet. So, unwittingly the balance I tried to split was a mix of ETH I aquired both pre and post fork. This is the only reason I can figure that the ETC never showed up. I literally changed nothing else after the test but the amount to send. 

I tried once more, entering an amount that I knew was smaller than my pre-fork balance. Still no dice. 

My main ETH stash is still intact of course but none of the ETC ever showed up in my unforked wallet except for the single one that I sent first as a test. 

u/insomniasexx, does this make sense? Did I blow it? I'm thinking so. If you do any action involving Etheruem, please be careful to ensure every single bit you broadcast is exactly as intended, unless you have a tight in-group of friends with the founding team to bail you out"

2016-07-28 22:01:12;Why Ethereum Classic is overvalued;"Well, thats a little too much whining about the efforts of separating ETC from ETH ;-) 
Its really not so hard and not dangerous!
Hope more people would realize this.

First of all there is this little nice guide how to do it really simple:
http://whysos3rious.com/index.php/2016/07/27/tutorial-how-to-access-your-etc-and-sell-it-for-eth-fight-back-and-profit/

All these actions help to understand ETH better and the guide worked for me, although I had to wait until today to sell my ETC on Kraken. (I just didn`t want to start another trading account at Poloniex.)

Second thing is: I have and had several backups of the Ethereum wallet and blockchain at different stages on a fast SSD. It was clear to me before the HF to make backups of the Ethereum folders (incl. the blockchain) in case something goes wrong. But there are other reasons to keep recent backups of the blockchain, too.
I´d recommend that to everyone.

So, I already had a nearly complete pre-HF blockchain to switch to ETC with a new Mist Wallet. It was just a matter of copy and paste. 
No new blockchain downloads necessary, beware!

Important: I keep both wallets and chains with different USERS at the same PC. No new or other PC needed, but another user!

Third thing: The ""HF Conditional Send"" contract worked nicely and I got the ETC into a new account(-address) thats the most important thing. I pulled out the other account addresses from the wallet by removing the keys from the keystore folder(and did the same for my different ETH-wallet!).

Both wallets have different names now, to be able to separate them from another and inside ETC and ETH have different addresses, each.Interesting article. It's true - separating ETH and ETC is not trivial, especially if you have to make a try before selling all ETC tokens. For example - split contract allows to use only integers. Sometimes the contract fails because of too small fee etc. In such cases you need to manually send ETH and ETC tokens between your accounts to check if they are separated. In summary - I see market opportunity here.2 things: 1) he has been wrong about every single prediction: said ETH would be way higher by now, said bitcoin could never pass 450,... 2) I'm not a technical guy and it took me 1 minute to set up my ETC wallet and 4 hours to download the full blockchain.Because you don't have any and didn't buy it? What a bunch of bullshit.

'Ethereum Classic, like Bitcoin, is an illiquid market where most of the value is being held on paper'

It are the two most liquid crypto's there are! the more people talk about ETC the more interest it gets and as a subsequent result it increases its value.

from all the shit posting against ETC there's an awful lot of insecurity and fear towards ETC, my question is, if you say that you don't think it's worth shit then why do you keep talking about it and smearing it? imo, that's an underlying insecurity from the ethereum community. 

We will see what happens but as of now, ETC has demonstrated that there is strong demand for ethereum that is immutable and non-reversible, none of which is true for ETH the moment they decided to fork and politicize the debate. The best solution to avoid replay is to choose 1 or the otherMy “ETC” are truly vapor at this stage, since my exchange does not give me access to them. Simply looking at ETC charts does not reflect its actual market price, because its smaller market (initially Poloniex) translates to it being an illiquid marketETC is what ETH is claiming to be but not is! which is decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

In other words ETH before the hardfork is now ETC and with a huge discount!"

Seems like a waste of time to write so much about a wrong assumption.I don't know why but the slideshare link went to a blank page for me....here's a working slideshare link? 

http://www.slideshare.net/MrCollectrix/code-is-not-law?qid=d433f3e3-130c-4af5-9127-3c72c1328e5e&v=&b=&from_search=1UPDATE - Better URL here -> ttp://www.ofnumbers.com/2016/08/09/code-is-not-law/ If code is not law, then why does [ethereum.org](https://www.ethereum.org/) still say ""Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: **applications that run exactly as programmed** without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference."" ?

Does anyone still believe that?  That dapps will run without third party interference?  That they'll run exactly as programmed?

Because this article basically says the opposite.  The hard fork proved it.  Dapps will be censored if deemed ""dangerous"".  They will not run as programmed if there's a bug.  Third parties will interfere if there is support.

Does no one have a problem with that?  This is what blows my mind.note: the smart contract code had a f'law & the f created a fuck-up that the DAO couldn't fix... now we have ETH & ETC - not law or bugs, just loop holes in code that got exploited by many. I sold my ETC & paid some rent for some else...Sigh. https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4wwgxg/if_the_white_hat_hacker_sells_those_600k_etc_they/d6ayoih

The world legal derives from **loyal**. It is common to confuse law for **centralized law** which is what the nation-state era has used. **Centralized law** is based on coercion and violence, and is a primitive system that originated because it is **hard to do decentralized law on ""human blockhains""**, and large-scale voluntarism has therefore _never been tested_. While developing Ethereum, the co-founder Gavin Wood has _simultaneously_ developed a narrative for what law is now evolving into, and he calls this [crypto-law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh9BxYTSrGU). Another crypto researcher, Johann Gevers, [talks about _decentralized law_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oeiOeDq_Nc). 

The crypto revolution forces us to look at law as a _technology of trust_, a means to extend the ways in which we can organize ourselves as a society. Within this new narrative, the **crypto-law** idea tells us that we could use math and, as information security researcher Nick Szabo says, **Automata as Authority**, to build general purpose protocols on top of which we could build decentralized voluntarism legal systems. In that future, which we are moving into at an exponential rate, code is de facto law. ""Code-is-Law"" is not a metaphor, instead, it is part of a new type of society and we need to look at this future not using the metaphors of the past, but the language of the future.

As Nick Szabo writes in [**Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks**](http://szabo.best.vwh.net/formalize.html), where he also coins the concept **smart-contracts**, and **Automata as Authority**

>""Miller foresees that the law of the Internet, and the devices attached to it, will be provided by a grand merger of law and computer security. If so, smart contracts will be a major force behind this merger. ""

And as Johann Gevers, co-founder of Monero says, 
> _""I refer to all of these systems as the technology of trust. Where human-based trust-systems do not scale, technology-based systems scale virtually without limit, beyond **dunbar's number.** ""_

So, the whole point of using technology to augment our limitations, the memory limit known as **dunbar's number**, is to use what Nick Szabo called Automata-as-Authority, and this translates literarily into Code-is-Law. This is the whole point of **crypto-law**."

2016-08-11 19:22:51;DDoSCoin: Cryptocurrency with a Malicious Proof-of-Work;"Oh dear...Read that with the sole interest of seeing how they use TLS to verify a DDoS.  Left me with a question.  Maybe someone will be able to answer it.

**Summary of the paper:**

First, pp1 and 2 describe the idea if you just want that.  They use the signed response of a TLS negotiation with a server to prove that a miner did, indeed, make a connection to that server in an attempt to DDoS it.  A miner can prove that they DDoS'd a large number of times by satisfying a restriction on the signed response.  The paper suggests having something like N zeros at the head of the signed response, which would naturally only occur once in every [math-math-math], well, after a lot of work was proven.

* Page 1:

They state state that TLS1.2 introduced a client-signed parameter that was not there in TLS1.1, and go on to say:

""In modern versions of TLS, the server signs a client-provided parameter during the handshake, along with server-provided values used in the key exchange of the connection. This allows the client to prove to others that it has communicated with the server.""

Now, in RFC5246, section 7.4.6, ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.6 ), it looks like the client cert has the same structure as the server cert, which is:

    opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

          struct {
              ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
          } Certificate;

The only difference between TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 being:

> If the client provided a ""signature_algorithms"" extension, then all
>    certificates provided by the server MUST be signed by a
>    hash/signature algorithm pair that appears in that extension.  Note
>    that this implies that a certificate containing a key for one
>    signature algorithm MAY be signed using a different signature
>    algorithm (for instance, an RSA key signed with a DSA key).  This is
>    a departure from TLS 1.1, which required that the algorithms be the
>    same.  Note that this also implies that the DH_DSS, DH_RSA,
>    ECDH_ECDSA, and ECDH_RSA key exchange algorithms do not restrict the
>    algorithm used to sign the certificate.  Fixed DH certificates MAY be
>    signed with any hash/signature algorithm pair appearing in the
>    extension.  The names DH_DSS, DH_RSA, ECDH_ECDSA, and ECDH_RSA are
>    historical.

So I'm left unsure what they mean by ""client-provided parameter"" - it must be in some part of the protocol I'm not seeing on first reading?  What do they mean by ""client-provided parameter"" on page 1?  

I feel like this is probably obvious to someone who has really studied TLS.  Maybe if they sharpened up the terminology or referenced a section of the spec this would be obvious to me as well.

* Page 2 (an interesting aside mentioning ethereum):

""For example, it is possible to create an Ethereum contract that pays a bounty to anyone that can provide a proofof-DDoS for a specified target. This would effectively accomplish the same outcome as PAY_TO_DDOS (described in Section 4.3.1) by implementing DDoSCoin’s proof-of-DDoS verification.""

* Then on page 4, section 4.1, a description of the validation process, of which this is the key sentence:

""After the victim has been verified to be a valid one, the public key is used to verify the server key exchange signature. This signature is over the client_random, server_random, and server key exchange parameters.""

* Finally, a nice TLS exchange summary on page 5.

It ends by listing some defenses against DDoSCoin.  I think the defenses are quite strong.  First, a public DDoSCoin chain would alert the good guys as to when they will be under DDoS.  If the DDoS is really successful, then it will slow down TLS, while the defender generates solutions on a compute cluster, achieving as much of an edge in creating the solution as they want - the defender wins every block - bankrupting the bounty.

Anyway, that's my reading of this one.

Feels like a pretty weak weapon in the current arms race, but a neat paper and an interesting idea that might show up in some other form someday - or maybe with a private chain.

In contrast, the results support the idea that non-anonymous aggressive sanctions are more effective. Non-anonymity helps to gain recognition [78], increases one’s persuasive power [74], and mobilizes followers [85]. The result is also in line with public voices that observe an increasing social acceptance of non-anonymous digital hate speeches [99].

In myetherwallet it's shown that I don't have any more DAO.
I tried this before my morning coffee. I read ''percentage of etc you want to donate"" as ""percentage of tokens you want to withdraw"". Oh well I hope they enjoy it.
Be careful. Don't be an idiot like me :/Much love to the MEW duo, what a team you two are!!!couldn't agree more, MEW is an awesome platform! insomniasexx in particular is consistently helpful and patient, which is wonderful for technophobes like me! 
In terms of ETC refund did anyone else struggle? I can see my balance on etherscan (it doesn't appear on MEW but my DAO balance didn't either and that refund worked), but when I click big red button no refund going through to the new account I set up. Not sure what I'm missing :-/ help would be greatly appreciated :-)"
2016-09-01 20:32:43;SingularDTV: A Decentralized “Netflix” on Ethereum;"Looks like NASDAQ picked up the story also http://www.nasdaq.com/article/singulardtv-a-decentralized-netflix-on-ethereum-cm673772SingularDTV is super exciting stuff. I am so excited for every aspect of itIn the legacy world, TVOD is continually on the rise and changing the way the world consumes film and television content, especially in the United States. These are older numbers but In 2013 iTunes accounted for 67% of all digital TV downloads. In 2014, 40% of Americans had access to TVOD platforms in their households. Apple also reported 25 million Apple TV boxes sold to date as well as 800 million registered iTunes accounts. These numbers continue to rise.

In the blockchain world, TVOD platforms will most likely be the only viable platforms moving forward, the platforms that are most inherently parallel with how the blockchain works. SVOD and AVOD platforms will most likely be rendered obsolete or be made impractical due to the amount of technical encumbrance they may need to create in order to operate their models on the blockchain.

SingularDTV is building a decentralized entertainment industry on Ethereum. Aside from the creative content we are rolling out, our rights/revenue/royalty management platform will be the infrastructure for not just a tokenized ecosystem but a decentralized economy for artists, producers, ent. investors and other creators, or anyone else that finds value in using our platform, watching our content or using our smart contract modules. This management system is essentially a series of smart contract modules that pushes terms and conditions - information - around the network. They will have crossover appeal into other industries as well, since the terms and conditions of film/tv projects share so many inherent business practices with other industries.Great concept. How would the storage of all this content work?100% absolutely positively doomed to failure.

1. Nobody will pay per view for entertainment. Or at least very few people will.

2. There are already quite a few services that will scrape all the content and post it online. Probably traditional web ones with ad support. Maybe theyll make one sale for every thousand views.How could this compete with PopcornTime?

> The team behind SingularDTV, a blockchain-based digital content distribution and management platform, is planning the launch of a decentralized system in which artists and digital content creators can build, monetize, protect and manage their creations using the blockchain technology.

> Based on the Ethereum network and the ConsenSys venture production studio, SingularDTV relies on a tokenized ecosystem using a local cryptocurrency called SNGLS to help artists and creators benefit from transparent media production and distribution.

> The Ethereum network, which is primarily based on smart contracts, has since allowed the SingularDTV team to create a decentralized and scalable platform with which they can integrate various applications to handle various operations.

2016-09-01 19:59:42;KIBO: Creating the World's First Blockchain Lottery;"It's also not the ""world's first blockchain lottery"".Sounds super interesting, but...

> To fund this ambitious project, developers are holding an ICO, opening on October 1. The goal for this crowdfund is to sell 100,000,000  KIBIT TOKENS (KBT) to the public. KBT represents a stake of the platform, similar to shares of a company. After the platform’s full launch, 4 percent of its profits will be distributed to KBT holders. The amount holders receive will be determined by the amount of tokens in their possession. [...] The starting ICO price for KIBITS is 100 ETH for 5000 KBT. The KIBO team says that any additional number of KBT can be bought after the initial 5,000 KBT purchase. 

Does that mean with 100.000.000 KBT in total the aim is to raise 20.000.000 €. Isn't that a little to much for lottery smart contract?$1M you already raised is more than enough for what you plan to do. Why do you need an ICO? who is the team? no public faces?Why does every hobbyist-grade dapp need crowdfunding all of the sudden? 

And how do these absolutely garbage offerings manage to raise more than a few hundred dollars?

2016-09-08 23:59:39;Dell Computers drops Blockchain bombshell: Files Blockchain patent application. Mentions Ethereum--- Is it a Decentralized Github??? [Twitter];"I converted the PDF to text and searched. Ethereum is mentioned a few times indeed. In fact they also mention Bitcoin but only for background and comparison purposes. Ethereum seemed to be more interesting to Dell in the paper.  I didn't read the whole paper but this part immediately struck me when I skimmed through it. 

> The initial concept of secure distributed transaction
ledger, including cryptocurrency, was proposed in 2009 in a
paper entitled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,""
listing Satoshi Nakamoto as the author, which is incorporated
by reference herein. The details of maintaining and
assuring the state of a secure distributed transaction ledger ( or
block chain) are known in the art and shall not be discussed
further herein.
[0057] Recently, the technology for secure distributed
transaction ledgers has evolved to incorporate a wider range
of information. A new generation of decentralized cryptographically
verifiable transactions ledgers are emerging that
include a Turing Complete computational model; such a
model can support smart contracts, among many other things.
There are at least two instances of these systems, Ethereum
and Bitcoin.
[0058] Ethereum is very similar to Bitcoin in that it uses a
cryptographically verifiable block chain that is extended by
proof-of-work, with the longest chain identifying the consensus.
It includes a number of improvements that address limitations
in how the Bitcoin block chain is extended, and
improve the performance and storage requirements of the
process. The most significant feature of the Ethereum framework
is the inclusion of a ""trustful object messaging compute
framework."" This framework includes the definition of the
""Ethereum Virtual Machine"" (EVM) and its associated ""bytecode""
instruction set. The EVM is an abstract stack machine
of similar nature to the Java Virtual Machine (NM) but not
5
Sep. 8,2016
the same. Programs written for the EVM may be referred to as
""contracts"" or ""code"" and are recorded in the Ethereum block
chain.
[0059] In Ethereum, these programs can be invoked by
""sending"" data to their ""addresses"" (e.g., a 256-bit address),
which were specified when they were originally recorded in
the ledger. The execution of the computations using the data
as input is part of the block chain ""mining"" process defined
for the system. That is, execution of these programs/contracts
is performed by block-chain ""miners"" whenever a transactional
message addressed to the contract is recorded in the
block chain. The time and resources required to support the
execution of a contract are ""paid for"" through the exchange of
a native virtual currency called ""Ether."" The amount of currency
available for a contract's execution may be pre-specified
before execution. If that amount is exceeded execution of
the contract is aborted, with no results recorded, and full
amount of the currency transferred to the miner; this feature
avoids problems with infinite loops in execution, or excessive
resource utilization; the miner always gets paid. Thus, the
result of such execution is either exhaustion of the resources
provided for execution, resulting in no output, or the program
completes and generates output. In the latter case, the result is
returned to the ""caller"" or originator as another entry in the
        ledger.Looks like config management on the blockchain.  Perhaps syncing your settings, bookmarks, etc.  Already exists in many forms as centralized services (iCloud, google).  But this uses blockchain.  Not sure what this provides except avoiding the cost of centralized infrastructure.

But that might be enough to justify its existence, I'm not a bean counter so you'd have to do the math to figure out if it would be a money saver.

It does show market penetration of Ethereum though.I don't see how patents are really valid for software.  If its some specific type of blockchain used only for storing configuration -- if they come up with an innovation, its probably going to be more general than that.  If its just some specific way of using existing ideas, how useful is it to have exactly one piece of software that can interact with that protocol/whatever?  And why is it important to protect their right to have the only software that can read/write it, since we established its only a specific way of using pre-existing techniques.

I think the patents just make it harder for us to adopt standards, integrate components, generally improve systems and also can almost lock out groups that can't afford lawyer battalions.Software distribution is a clever usage case.http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=ethereum&FIELD1=&co1=AND&TERM2=&FIELD2=&d=PG01Essentially this patent is to configure a device on the Block Chain to be ready for additional configuration instructions. For Ethereum this could mean hundreds of thousands or even millions of new and old computers being ""registered"" in smart contracts just by one manufacturer, calling other contracts. 

If this patent is enforceable, I am curious if the team at Dell who developed this utility patent have run projections on network use, gas costs, and any revenues they think they might generate by licensing their ""method"".  Many patents often don't get used for economic reasons. So I am wondering who is ultimately paying for use of the network?

With Chronicled, the Ethereum gas costs are bourne by a company seeking to effectively add value to their brand and as a consumer protection against fraudulent knockoffs. What's the value proposition for Dell and their users? Or does this method just streamline Dell's back office rendering staff positions obsolete?This likely has to do with the completion of Dell's merger with EMC. That is a really dated websiteI'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

2016-09-08 21:13:54;Devcon2 just sold out! Who's going and why are you making the trip?;"I'm going. 

Why?

I want to be at the tip of the spear. My view is that the next wave of the internet is the internet of value. It won't just be instant and near zero cost; it will also be *programmable*.

I want to meet cool and interesting people from all over the world. I hope to accelerate my business, do things better than I ever thought possible and maybe even move on completely and do something entirely different. I want to leave a bigger dent in the universe.

I also want to experience one of the world's great 21st century cities and go see an old friend in Beijing.I'm going. Finishing a PhD in physics and planning on making the jump from physics to crypto-land. Plan on seeing some interesting projects at Devcon2, for ideas of things to work on. I decided that if I was serious about the being involved with Ethereum, there wouldn't be another opportunity that comes any where close to it, in terms of learning or connections, until Devcon3.I'm going because the speakers are amazing and it is going to be great time. A lot is being done behind the scenes to make this conference 100x better than last year's fantastic Devcon1.Pissed cause I can't be there in person but will keep myself updated from Seoul, please try to upload to YouTube asap, many would appreciate! 
Have fun guys!I'm going to personally thank all the people who worked so hard on such a remarkable project which ended up changing the course of my life.It seems many of us are responding with a similar sentiment: We are making the trip simply because we believe Ethereum (and its community/leaders) are right at the cutting edge, and it's important for us to be as close to that as we can get.

I've personally been investing in different cryptocurrencies, and while I avoid short-term day-trades, I do move my money on a semi-weekly basis depending on how things look. At the very least, going to devcon will give me a much better feel for what the industry leaders are looking at and moving toward, which could pay off in the form of informing my investment decisions.

But that's just money. What I'm more excited about is meeting the people there. On one hand, you have the industry leaders, from Vitalik Buterin (ALL HAIL) on down. On the other hand, you have the people like me--those who have decided that this technology is important enough to warrant a plane ticket as well as the ticket to devcon itself. Both groups are going to be incredibly stimulating to be around.

I'm also traveling around SE Asia for a while afterward, and I don't think it's too far-fetched to think I might meet some new friends who I could travel with or visit, then or later on!I'm going to meet fellow entrepreneurs who already ventured or planning their Dapps, for networking and collaboration. My company, Everex.one are the first who puts national fiat currencies and traditional financial assets on Ethereum blockchain to facilitate financial inclusion via accessible global remittance, currency exchange, and capital markets. I'll gladly meet with any anyone who shares the same ideas. Me.  Went to Devcon1 in London.  Would have gone to Devcon0 in Berlin had it been open to anyone.   

Going because this is the epicenter of my 4 year hobby.  Going because I want to learn more and meet more people.   Going because Shanghai is a dubiously impressive city to see.I am going to learn about the projects and businesses people are building using Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. I want to collaborate with people who are doing interested projects. I am a skilled developer interested in cryptocurrencies and my aim is to do real world application projects. Having a one to one conversation and meeting new people in the space will be much more productive and super exciting. Also Shanghai seems like interested city to explore!"

With updates to the protocol this time around, there won't be any reason not to use the newest version.
no, why would it?This will likely be similar to the hard fork that happened when Ethereum upgraded from Frontier to Homestead. I don't think any users noticed it at all, because the miners and exchanges all simultaneously switched over to Homestead and nobody continued to run Frontier. There was no reason to - Frontier was just objectively worse than Homestead.

With the DAO there was no clear-cut ""this one is better, that one is useless"" conclusion. So some people continued using each branch of the fork.Wondering the same thing"

Part of the reason why i haven't installed MIST. Waiting for it to be updated before using.


Sorry about these problems. We switched to using electron-builder to build installers for all platforms and by default for Windows it uses ""squrrel"" as it's installer. We're now working on using a different installer. In the worst case we can simply go back to using ZIPs.

Note that many of the devs (myself included) don't use Windows, and so we just assumed that the current installation flow was the standard Windows one.I agree. I'm not very smart and what you just described addresses things I've noticed in my noobish ways.  Thank goodness I knew about the hidden folder part.

I think for commoners like me it would be nice if it installed with options that the user can decide just like any other product.  Except I don't want it to try and offer me the all new Edge browser and Yahoo toolbar.  LolThe Ui experience is surely less important than the back end at this point, it makes sense for the EF to concentrate on that right now.  I'd suggest demoing myetherwallet and metamask.  Even better, show them the nano ledger s.

I agree completely. I found the lack of installation directory options very weird and annoying. I had to go find the folder manually. And it wasn't where my old copy was. So it screwed that up for me.I completely agree with all those points. It's a pretty terrible user experience. Why on earth is it in AppData? It would be great if I could select where to install and where to put my chain data too.Agree with this. I complained sbout this a couple of weeks ago as well.I completely agree. If I'm about to download 30gb worth of blockchain, I might not want to install it into my appdata folder on my main drive, and could rather use a different directory on a different drive.I have to admit the OP did some points here. I recently started mist on Linux to look up a feature and was greeted by a splash screen telling me ""Upgrading binaries"" without any way to confirm or interact. I really do not want that mist is tampering with any binaries on my machine, give the users a little bit control.

I know it's for convenience, but some users like to have control over what's happening with their machines. Same also applies for building mist from source. It's currently not possible to build mist from source without downloading geth binaries through a gulp script. I already have geth build from source, so I do not require those binaries either.

In the end I just go to localhost:8080 to use the parity version of ethereum-wallet because I have that under control. It's a bit more unstable for now but works for the most parts.Exactly, would love a return of the zip for Windows, please!Same happened with Etherum Wallet for Linux.
  I used to extract the zip and have everything in my /Home directory. Now Geth unpacks itself in .config (hidden) /home/user/.config/Ethereum Wallet/ binaries/Geth/unpacked/geth 
Thankfully we won't have to put up with the Ethereum Foundation code garbage for very long since the EthCore guys seem to be picking up the slack with the Parity UI.  I'm all for free market solutions to the EF problem.  Quite a few false statements in this post. It reads like you are doing things left for last minute for your meetup due to lack of planning and you are just venting on this forum.  Latest versions of EW and Mist created shortcuts on my Win 10 desktop.  Latest Geth versions are always available at: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases

The problem is that due to recent attacks the gas limit was lowered and you can't deploy this wallet.  Should be fixed relatively soon. But there is no danger in keeping your ETH in a regular account as long as you backup the keystore file and password. The wallet contract is really only if you need multisig.

This hex priv key is the SHA256 hash of your passphrase. This might be a useful info in case you want to double check by recreating the brainwallet also from another source.

And of course, make sure you do an extremely good job on the entropy of your passphrase.you shouldn't (as in really, really shouldn't) create a brain wallet today - see https://rya.nc/forensic-bitcoin-cracking.html

2016-11-10 21:31:30;Considerations against the Golem Crowdsale;"The crowdfunding is about to start in a few hours and we have just deployed the Golem crowdfunding contract. There is not much time for an extended discussion at this moment, but I would like to address the most important concerns raised by /u/jakelanor. 

**A general comment**

I believe the most important problem with this review is that only part of our goals (and business case behind it) is taken into consideration. 

We’re creating a platform to buy and sell computing power. Today this market is vastly inefficient, there is a huge asymmetry of information (comparing offers, sending tasks etc.) and the surplus is divided between oligopolists. We want to make it easier for both individuals and small to medium sized providers to join the game and disrupt this market. 
 
Even more importantly, Golem also aims at combining the market for computing power with the market for software, enabling every developer to integrate with it and set up monetization scheme of their choice.

Overall, the big idea is not necessarily to outperform others in terms of price (even though I still believe that in certain use cases Golem can be very price competitive), but to change the way clients, providers and developers interact with each other on the market.

**Comments on specific issues**


>lofty, attractive mission statements; pretty, material-design websites; “whitepapers” that are becoming less and less technical; immediately tradable tokens; and less and less complete codes released.


We are happy that you like our website. Actually, I think it is minimalistic in a way. 

Here is the [code](https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem), approximately 60 man months of work. 

Here is [working alpha](https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Installation). Feel free to try it. It works. 

Here is [something technical](http://golemproject.net/doc/GolemNanopayments.pdf). But yes, we are aware that a lot of technical stuff is ahead of us. We are looking forward to it :-)

The only reason to lock-up the crowdfunding tokens (endowment is locked for 6 months) is speculative - it is clearly visible with recent crowdfundings. **If someone is in for a long haul, it does not matter at all.** And we hope to attract this kind of supporters. 


>Thus for Golem to succeed, the Network must offer services strong enough to meet the requirements of not only regular individuals, but of Enterprises that require IaaS/PaaS/SaaS services.


This exactly what we are going to do. The working alpha version of Golem already offers user experience superior to most render farms. In the long run it makes more sense to consider Golem as a platform for developer to integrate with - and additional distribution channel for existing software. So rather than micromanaging every service on Golem to make it as potent for users as possible, we want software developers to do the job for Golem (and themselves as well). 


> At an individual level, I’m skeptical that there will be a large number of Requesters


Bringing a sufficient number of requestors on board is crucial for the success/failure of Golem. Please check out details of go-to-market strategy in [crowdfunding whitepaper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf).


> But with computing resources are already cheap, will the average Individual Provider actually make any meaningful money? Will the reward be profitable enough to encourage one keep his/her machine running and take care of any maintenance requirements?


What does it mean that computing resources are cheap? Cloud providers have double digit margins, this is not cheap at all. Prices in the Golem network are set by the users. Surely if they are not satisfied, they will quit. It seems however, that at least for what we have integrated so far, there is a lot of room for lower prices, way above providers costs - see [here](https://blog.golemproject.net/why-should-render-farms-be-afraid-of-golem-3dd1b9e70f47#.2ch5b37wp). Still, this is only part of the story (see opening paragraphs).    


>Based on even their most liberal projected timelines for the features of each “Golem” the total time is a staggering 93 months — that’s almost 8 years!!


Honestly, I have no idea where 93 months come from. Our timeline sums up to 48 months. First release is planned in 6 months and platform after 18-24 months will be already very advanced. Deliverables depend on the level of funds raised in the crowdfunding. 


>Golem makes interesting references to the IPFS project and others like Swarm but the additional dependency on developing technologies make the Golem project all the more risky.


Dependencies between projects are a strong point, not a weak one. This is how software development and progress in technology is generally achieved. If one thing fails, you need to find a substitute or figure out something yourself. 


>They explain the new “economics” of the token here, but I believe a crowdfund for a project like Golem is not an adequate incentive structure to ensure that the team continues to work on developing a performing product, especially for a project as ambitious as Golem.


This is not a new economic framework. I would say it is quite basic for projects in this space. It is very similar to Ethereum, for example.Thanks for the write up. I planned to write another '10 facts about' medium post but I'm just totally snowed under for the rest of the year.

I'm 'unsure' of the token model but it's important to consider that many buyers do it for the short term anyway, and longer term buyers always have the option to get out. We could discuss the pros and cons of that indefinitely, but the lack of buyer vesting period brings buyers options. For Golem itself, I would have liked to see an extended vesting period for tokens. I don't quite understand why it's only 6 months although Julian did suggest a technical reason we never had time to fully explore (we weren't sure it was a valid reason but I can't say one way or the other).

I don't really like transaction fee based token models unless there is a clearly limited resource that isn't easily replicated, e.g. ether. They may look good for buyers initially but I fear they are bad for the business and long term. I do keep revisiting my views on this so take that only as my current viewpoint! Transaction fees rely heavily on the network effect, limited resources, purpose, and fee establishing mechanisms that make sense, e.g. miners performing computation, anti-spam, strength of network. (Golem's is not a transaction fee model)

On the business side I genuinely believe it comes down to if people think a partially decentralised approach could deliver better results. I don't have the answer to that but many of us are here to do those experiments and I think it fair to say many here think it will. Personally, I'm on the fence because I don't feel I have the depth of knowledge to know. In the end, it comes down to a mixture of product and price, so that means it's very much down to Golem's team itself too.

Out of all the recent token sales I would suggest this is one of the better ones. As a business proposition, the jury is out and I expect that to be the case for > 2 years in all honesty. I don't think anyone should be expecting a quick success in in terms of the business, but there may be some nice stepping stones on the way. Projects like storj have shown how much time things take.

On the topic of the amount, I'm ok with it. Let the people spend money where they want. It's a capped sale although I would prefer a dutch auction model. Golem have gone about this process pretty well and I don't think there's an excuse here for not doing your research before putting money in. 

Since I also think, and this is an unpopular opinion, that we need 3-5 years to mature the technology (including swarm, ipfs), I want to see larger amounts of money raised but only if used to guarantee 3+ years of development at reasonable cost. 1-2 years is simply not long enough for projects like this, although a good set up would allow for further angel or vc funding.

We're in a space which cannot scale yet, which repeatedly shows its immaturity, and where maturation progress is far slower than people realise. I remember many things spoken of in early 2013 that have still not happened in late 2016. Decentralisation is tough. It can't be rushed and nor can businesses on top of it.

Good luck to the Golem team and thanks to the OP for his post too. Really pleasing to see other people taking the time to comment (good and bad) on token sales. It's a rather thankless task at times, but generally I think people want to see it.[deleted]I would add security and privacy concern, even in CGI case could be a problem.Very nice write-up, having used professional could services i share your opinon that it's gonna be very tough for Golem to compete with those established ecosystems.

2016-11-17 23:29:58;An Incentivized Platform for Professional, Sound And Decentralized Journalism built on Ethereum. Who's making this?;"I think some kind of crowd patronage for investigative reporting + peer review inspired fact check process would be interesting. The problem is there is no ground truth so this becomes a messy social reputation process rather some nice and clear incentives game. You would have three groups

* Patrons/reader. (No upvote steam like shill mechanism but rather some kind of deeper relationship. Patrons can unlock the next story. Perhaps voting on what the journalist should write about next or being able to chat with the journalist.)
* Journalists. (Reputation based on Fact checker rating.  Articles would have medium style comment markup which links prose to claims or insinuation)
* Fact checkers. (Reputation based on historic rating. i.e. they can be embarassed off chain if they have obvious bias)

Though I wonder if there is some merit in (a) measuring controversy rather than trying to get to ""the truth"" (b) historical revisiting when it is easier to be impartial. 

-----------------------

A related but completely different news service would be a decentralised uncensorable platform citizen journalism / [sousveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance) / livestreaming of news. But I worry that it could turn dystopian pretty fast with people putting up stuff to bully, shame or slander people. That is I don't necessarily buy David Brin's argument that mutual surveillance is a good thing but rather agree with Stallman that [mutual snooping can magnify power disparities](https://stallman.org/articles/dont-surrender.html) and harm vunerable or marginalised people.  I'm building Credsign (http://credsign.com) - a publishing platform built on Ethereum. The writing process resembles Medium (you can try publishing if you have Mist/Metamask installed, otherwise it's readonly). It's on Testnet, and will be released to Mainnet later this month. 

Publishing is the obvious first step. The next step is curation. Our approach will be to use stake-voting to vote on content, but that won't be production ready for some time. Would love any feedback if you try it out!Right on. I think something like this will be the first killer dapp. Akasha is something to keep eyes on, as they are creating a decentralized alternative to Medium. Will be interesting to see how this affects disinformation.I sort of built something like you are talking about. I haven't quite had the time to take it where I want to though.

[weiwardit.com](http://www.weiwardit.com)

It originally started out where you could ask questions and attach a bounty for answers, you can still reward answers with ETH , but now you can also reward OP.

So the idea kind of being that people can use it to publish articles, and be paid for them, if a reader chooses to tip them a small micropayment in ETH, or, as a place for people to ask questions they need answered urgently, and reward people that answer them.

It was built out of frustration with steemit, as a cross between steemit, reddit, quora, as well as frustrations with the current state of journalism.

It is not fully decentralized, it wasn't necessarily an exercise in decentralisation.

I just wanted people to be able to post a question, reward answers, or to post an article or some writing, and, if a reader likes it, they have the freedom to tip OP any amount of ether they choose, even if it is only 10c, but still, I think that is a pretty powerful idea.

It currently runs on Morden test-net only, so right now there is no real Ether. I do think with Googles new RankBrain search algorithms, naturally written content, written by humans, for humans will have a much better chance at reaching the top of search queries.

You can check it out at [weiwardit.com](http://www.weiwardit.com)

I have been yelled at to change the name. It was a play on the words WEI + reward + reddit.

I would like to eventually make all of the content decentralized, sitting on IPFS, and take it in the general direction you mention. Just not sure how to do that yet, or what is the best way to approach decentralized content like this."

Ty dev teamWell done Team, you deserve Big Thanks Giving.Mistakes are only mistakes if you don't learn from them.  Great job Eth Devs!!Thanks for the work from all the devs and the quick update. Never a boring day with eth ;) Are the exchanges which rely on geth now trading again?

Surely maintaining geth/neth/eth/parity/etc. diversity must be the new minimum standard now?

Thank goodness we had the foresight to grow and nurture this diversity. In my view, parity saved Ethereum from siezing up completely during DevCon. We learnt then and the steps we took then are paying off now. Reliance on one protocol implementation is not good for high value, mission critical use-cases (e.g. running an exchange).That was quick, kudos.Thanks for the news.  
Devs are doing a great job to fix it (I'm waiting geth 1.5.3 auto-update for Mist wallet)...  
But now I understand better when they say ""BTC Core devs are conservative, ETH devs are not really""...It's taken 10 minutes to go from 2,686,538 to 2,686,539 The less technically inclined people might start thinking those repetitive geth issues are starting to look like a lack of quality control prior to release. I believe that is not the case, but I think there should be communications addressing this very point. Please be open with the community about the struggle of producing bug free releases. You guys are not working for us, we are all working together towards the success of this platform. So please take a moment to express how you feel and how as a community we can help with those struggles. Thank you for all of your hard work!Good job team, keep it the good work but watch those mistakes. What you're doing is truly revolutionary, and it takes hard work to get there.

Well done.Severe sync problems.. it will take hours to sync 9K with this version.  You need an update to update the update to fix the broken sync!Im using Mist 0.8.7 and I didn't get the auto-update feature This is extremely important, but for me Green (sticky) titles are even harder to see than the most upvoted post, the one at the top. Anyone else having this problem?  

Also, shouldn't geth know to update itself by now, or would that present a potential security issue?It's taking too long too sync.  Running: geth --fast --cache=1024This explains why the price took another dive...

I hope we recover soon.
Since Mist version is still 0.8.7, how can I check if my Mist has automatically updated its geth to 1.5.3?

For example, a while back I had an idea for a multisig wallet that could be controlled this way, and posted it on reddit. The next day I [realized](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4wi8rn/multisig_storage_with_offline_wallets/) that a network-monitoring attacker with just one of the keys could steal all the funds.My Matthew contract uses the same technique. Depending on the state of the game, sending (even 0) Ether to the fallback function triggers a different functionality.

https://github.com/rolandkofler/matthew/blob/master/Matthew.sol

One can, of course have different proxy contracts in front to trigger various functions. 

Major question remains: how to do parametrized calls?

A public fountain on the blockchainThe easiest way is to simply send funds to an inaccessible address (or have a contract with no withdrawal mechanism). There is one way to actually 'destroy' ether: send the funds to a contract that selfdestructs with itself as the recipient address.

You could in principle send the funds to a 'gas burner' contract, which would simply refund to the caller of a 'burn' method the cost of calling it; the caller could then set an arbitrarily high gas price in order to use up all the stored Ether.

However, while locking up or burning funds the regular way distributes their value amongst all tokenholders, a 'gas burner' as described above rewards only the miner of the block in which the transaction was executed - which gives miners a direct incentive to add such transactions to their blocks to claim the funds. This seems intuitively less fair than locking or destroying the funds.My suggestion is a payable, tradable fee collector token.  Holders can do whatever they want with it then.  if you don't write the function to remove ether in your contract, the ether is 'burnt' in your contract"

Web3 JSONRPC can be placed behind a web server with SSL for zero clients.  

It's a good question if you're concerned about Ice-9.It would be a game of wack-a-mole. There are ways around detection & blocking.

The biggest danger is somewhere like China, where the internet could be disconnected from the rest of the world. This would be less of a worry to Ethereum, but it would make a mess of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin being mostly centralised in China, the blockchain would fork in China's favor. Transactions outside of China would be wiped out, as soon as internet was restored. Exchanges in the west would have to stop bitcoin withdraws and deposits.

This is why POW is a bad idea in the long run.Countries who care about their economic growth will not block a promising new technology. Russia changed its position on bitcoin soon enough.Yes, it's possible to a ISP to block anything, but it's not that simple, they will need computers working on packet selection and hire people to take care of that system. 
While ethereum fixes server centralization problem, it don't changes anything in the internet infrastructure. Maybe in future we can see a total p2p ISP tecnology, but for now we need ISP to connect everyone at fast speeds. It's all over tcp/ip so unless they want to block the internet they can't block it. It's not an application port either so they can't be selective from that sense. no largely but also yes because ports and because NSA (insert your favorite hate here)

2017-01-12 23:56:10;What Is the Difference Between Cryptocurrency, Blockchain and Bitcoin??;
2017-01-12 23:47:42;How do you explain Ethereum to people in a couple sentences?;"It's magic internet money. With macros. You know bitcoin? 

*sorta*

K so with bitcoin the whole magic is you can send this Internet money and everyone knows it because it's all public right? So no more need for JP Morgan to hold your money. You have bitcoin. You send bitcoin. You receive bitcoin. Anyone can tell you how much bitcoin you have. Done. 

*Right...*

So Ethereum is all that but with these things call smart contracts. Which means you can do more. You can send. Or you could have the app /smart contract send at a certain time. Or have the app not send unless it's a certain time. Or let's say you want to place a bet. You don't have to go to the casino and trust the casino, you just send to the app - the smart contract - and the rest happens. In public. So everyone can check and be like 'yup, she sent 1 eth. And the smart contract rolled the dice. And she won. And the smart contract sent her 10 eth'. 

*but I don't want anyone to know if I have 10 eth*

That's fine. It's all behind a string of numbers called an address. That isn't linked to your name, your identity. Why do we need your identity. We just got rid of banks and the Fed. And you can have however many addresses you want. Theyre free. That's what I build. I build an app where you click a button and it gives you a new address. And it doesn't ask you for anything. You just click a button. Click it 100 times. We don't even know you clicked it. 

*quietly dies of information overload*

😑

You know what a ledger is, as in accounting? Well there it this virtual ledger that is run by millions of computers together, all these computer together run this network. Well in this Ledger its written that Tony has $100, Doppio has $175 and Ted has $300. You have this encrypted key stored on your phone or in a flashdrive and if Ted wanted to send Doppio $25 he uses the encrypted key and the password in his head to turn that key and send that $25. All these computers check, did Doppio really use that encrypted key to send the $25 to Ted. If true then all the computers agree and the balance of this virtual ledger is updated. Doppio now has $200, Ted has $275 and Tony still has $100.


If he buys you another beer then keep talking......


This technology was created 8 years ago and since then the network has grown beyond belief. The Bitcoin blockchain is 500 times bigger than the worlds largest supercomputer and all this computation is just checking did Ted really send $25 to Doppio? This network burns more Electricity than the country of Ireland. This waste of electricity and computation is seen as inefficient so 46 computer scientists spent about 18 months building a new blockchain called Ethereum and instead of only building in money they put in a lot of the worlds computer programming languages, made it up-gradable and made it application pluggable like the Apps running on your smartphone. Now any company or person has free access to build any service they wish and can plug in and offer services on this new network. In this network all the computation and electricity can be used and directed to do research. So if a company wants to do massive computations instead of building massive warehouse with massive computers inside they can just pay and rent a % of everyones processor on this network to do this computation faster and cheaper. So you can rent out a % of your processor but you can also rent out lets say 50% of you 1TB hard drive to to Ethereum network. So Ethereum isnt just a payment DAPP like Bitcoin, Its a world Virtual computer where 7 Billion people can participate and we can all connect together and have this massive computation and massive storage bank. Because all this is spread out accross the millions of computers together there is no server in 1 place where hackers can steal or where governments can spy on the network.


Ethereum was only released to the world on August 2015 after being built by 46 computer scientists but now 18 months later their are over 20,000 developers building out applications on it. So its worth studying into this emerging technology now before the other 7 Billion people start using it.

PS: the lift your in is going up to floor 257 and has a barman present*I've been practicing this lately on different people. It is not easy...*

Ethereum and blockchains are ""very reliable computing"". In a blockchain, transactions are secured with cryptography and confirmed by many users. The transactions can't be interfered with, and the data can't be modified. 

With all of the hacking going on lately, this is becoming important.

 *...person might say something about recent hacking incident XYZ*

You have probably heard about Bitcoin. This is a blockchain for storing and transferring value. As long as you have internet, you can send coins to anyone, and that person will get them.

 *...at this point, person might talk about implications of being able to transact freely*

So Ethereum is a blockchain for running simple programs. Instead of one-time transfer, it can be a rental agreement or a game. When you set up a program like this, it can't be stopped or modified, so the code will run no matter what. You don't have to pay very much for it either.

 *...at this point, person might weigh in on the implications of contracts that can't be stopped*

The community is building all kinds of apps on top of Ethereum, it is a very exciting space.When you deposit money into your Chase account, they go ahead and update your account balance. In Ethereum, you create an account that you can send Ether to and thousands of computers that are part of the Ethereum network update your balance in the Ethereum blockchain. Developers can build smart contracts that the Ethereum network enforces through computer code, similar to how Chase can make a mortgage contract and enforce it through their rules.Ethereum is a thing that replaces a trusted third party contract enforcer with machine consensus. What use cases that it is preferable to make this switch for remains to be seen. programmable moneyEthereum is a new platform on which decentralized applications can be built. Decentralized applications are applications that run on many servers simultaneously and are therefore very hard to disrupt or censure. Ethereum enables such decentralized applications by providing a solution to reach global consensus on the changes made to the state of the application. The state that Ethereum securely and consistantly maintains can be used by decentralized applications to represent many things such as account balances, ownership of property or assets, number of votes, game scores, and many more.It is really difficult to do. If you find a way to do it please let me know.

So you know how sometimes you need a trusted third party to hold money, administer some records, or enforce rules. For example:

* Escrow
* Registry 
* Dungeon master
* Auctioneer
* Rating site

[get them to offer examples]

Well Ethereum lets you replace them with a single computer that all parties can trust not to cheat. 

----------

I used to mention bitcoin but now I find it just confuses people and they have a really hard time understanding that it is not just another cryptocurrency. But then you still have to get into how records in a database can represent value and ownershop as a result of legal status and/or social convention.Im using this line a lot: 

""We build a cloud computing platform, just like amazon has one. But ours has two main differences: one, it can handle money directly, and secondly, it's not controlled by a central party"".

It's like if Microsoft Excel was an MMORPG.People are messy, computers are consistent. But, one computer is vulnerable. Imagine 1000s of computers watching over contracts and keeping records, and to compromise the results and history, a hacker has to take down half that much. How much safer can you get?... Eth is a platform based on a similar block chain technology to Btc; except rather than just being limited to functioning as a transfer of value you can write smart contracts which are secured by the block chain and can be coded to execute themselves autonomously.

Btc is like the coal of block chain technologies while Eth is more like a TeslaEthereum is a mainframe. You rent compute and storage with special tokens. No one company owns Ethereum.An internet based on the principles of peer to peer transactions and decentralized organizations where each bit of information is cryptographically secured and stored in a pseudoanonymous transparent ledger? Lol idk. Its so difficult to sum up. But thats my best effortIt is a virtual machine that executes via a peer to peer computer network, on which everyone agrees on the current state of execution.  This enables value to be controlled via trustless contracts.A trusted third party that can't keep secrets.Let's say you rent a place on AirBnb (in the not too distant future when most new'ish companies speak Ethereum). You pay the rate by sending a few Ether to an address. When you show up at the door of your rental space with your phone, software checks the Blockchain to make sure you've paid and then automatically unlocks the door.

Or, say you Uber in some strange city, you fill up your account by sending a few Ether to your Uber Blockchain address.

Or say you need to spend an extended time in a different city and you decide to rent transportation. You send a few Ether to an address controlled by the rental agency. As long as you keep the account filled up, the car will start, when it dips below some agreed amount, the car simply drives itself back to the agency.It's the USB-C of bitcoin. So many new features but not widely adopted or known as USB2/BTC.   I'd first stare in amazement that they've never seen any of the terminator series and then quitely wisper:

It's the birth of skynet!Heard of Bitcoin? Do you kind of understand how email works? You set up an account to send emails and information to eachother. It just works, right?  Well, Bitcoin is like that except you exchange value, or money called Bitcoin.  So why does Bitcoin matter? It found a way to ensure that when you send an email you can be 100% certain it is the only copy in existence, or like physically transferring a gold bar. It verifies this using something called The Blockchain, which acts as a sort of central ledger with a specific job to maintain, update, and secure the ledger.  It's is also incapable of altering or censoring the ledger. This is a technological feat and necessary evolution for digital authentification and security.

Ethereum is like email on crack. Not only can you exchange value, such as any currency, you can also notarize digital contracts.  This allows you to enter any contract or agreement that can be digitally enforced or financially backed, and be 100% certain the terms will be carried out as agreed upon. These systems will be the backbone for the Internet of Things, your digital identity, the sharing industry in a digital world, and things we haven't thought of yet.  A platform that enables anyone, anywhere to interact with decentralized contracts. These contracts may be apps, financial products, etc.It is a decentralized world computer for general purpose. So you could:

- Create a payment system (like Bitcoin, with no banks in the middle)
- Create a notary system (with no notaries in the middle)
- Enable share economy, trading services and products with no middle men. For instance, trade energy or resources such as CPU or Storage)

And the big picture, create an internet 3.0 with no hosting and DNS servers. Users would be able to connect directly to each others, share information and run applications.

TL;DR: We are the BorgProgrammable money on the internet. Skynet. Very difficult to do because we don't know if Ethereum will be used or be useful yet.  We have some prelimary applications, we have some concepts, and we have some beliefs, but nothing tangible yet.  I remain optimistic and the last two weeks have surprised me to the good. But it's nascent and we don't know what Ethereum will be, we can speculate on what it could be.  How do you express that to someone?

In the past for ETH, I have used a comment from /u/Dunning_Krugerrands/

[ETH for Noobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/52l2pf/help_explain_eth_to_a_noob/d7lgg93/)

> It allows people (or software agents) to design and play multiplayer 'games.' and have the 'rules of the game' enforced by a decentralised tamper proof computer. The impact and excitement comes from understanding that just about any financial or political activity can be modelled as a 'game'. Ethereum thus offers the chance to engineer new economic and social systems without requiring institutional trust or state/corporate level resources.

From a highly redacted draft of a paper (which includes the comment above) I have been writing for my firm:

> **Ethereum | 2015 | Secure decentralized programmable blockchain platform and value transfer | $800mm**

> In response to Bitcoin’s innovation and promise to be “the internet of money,” certain developers looked and saw Bitcoin as too limited in terms of what can be done on and with its blockchain and too limited in terms of how it can scale.  They asked, “what if we added full programmability into the blockchain itself? What if we created a programmable blockchain platform with a native currency on which people could build decentralized applications that run on the blockchain itself?”  These developers sold this idea to the public as Ethereum in 2014.  They released Ethereum a year later and it is now valued at over $800mm with dozens of Dapps in production and a few close to release.....

> **What could make this huge?**

> If the Dapps are good and serve real world use cases, it will build on itself, and create a synergistic ecosystem of Dapps interacting with other Dapps and connected with Ethereum.  Network effects squared.  Ether the currency (ETH) would be the reserve currency in this ecosystem.  Additionally, one of the technological innovations they have on their roadmap is a new kind of mining that uses stakes of ETH itself to secure the blockchain.  That alone may advantage ETH.

> What businesses benefit most (if any) from decentralization is an open question.  It may be none.  Most Dapps I listed above will fail as the market iterates to what works.  The real prize is if Ethereum or Dapps disrupt current ways of doing business and create entirely new industry designs.  One theory that hits home is that a robustly designed prediction market can become a decentralized asset manager...

And lastly two days ago in slack, I wrote a description of all large, relevant crypto projects (An omission of anything with a decent market cap means their raison d'etre is suspect at best but truly everything can fail even on this list):

* Bitcoin: potential store of value

* ETH: Web 3.0, disruptive decentralized smart contracts, applications and businesses on the blockchain, also potential store of value

* Monero: privacy focused store of value, currency

* Zcash: privacy focused store of value, currency

* Augur: Ethereum-based prediction market incentive token

* Digix: Ethereum-based digital tokenized gold and other commodities

* Steem: decentralized social network / Medium

* Sia/Storj/IPFS/Maidsafe: decentralized storage/Dropbox

* Factom: record/registry focused blockchain

* Golem: Ethereum-based decentralized compute/AWS incentive token

* Iconomi: Ethereum-based decentralized cryptocurrency passive investing index mgmt/creation

* Firstblood: Ethereum-based P2P video game betting incentive token

* Ripple: centralized digital FX rail

Someone had asked for a breakdown of all the higher market cap crypto projects that were worthwhile and the response above wasn't deemed witty enough so I punched it up as follows:

* **BTC:** Organic pyramid scheme

* **ETH:** Premined ponzi scheme

* **Monero:** Organic terrorist shekels

* **Zcash:** Premined terrorist shekels

* **Ripple:** Corporate ponzi scheme

* **Steem:** Facebook chain letter MLM scheme*Ok, going to take another swing at this now, off the top of my head:*

Ethereum is a type of blockchain and it offers reliable and decentralized computing. All activity is securely confirmed by other users, and recorded in a shared ledger

The way the cloud works, data can be changed or stolen if a hacker gets in. With Ethereum, transactions cannot be blocked or altered, and you access your data with a key. 

A metaphor might be: instead of a cloud, we have a crystal.

Bitcoin, as you have probably heard, lets you reliably send digital money to anyone, anywhere. Ethereum on the other hand lets you create small programs called contracts. These contracts enable you to reliably form relationships with other users anywhere. You can interact with games or create customized bank accounts. 

A lot of apps are now being built on Ethereum, it is a very exciting space to be in.You know the kind of discoveries/inventions that shaped the path of humanity? Discovery of fire, invention of the wheel, steam engines, powered flight and the internet?

Well Ethereum will have more or less the same kind of impact to the world, better start reading on it!Bitcoin with loops.Bitcoin with computers.I'd say :   
>  -Do you know Ethereum?  
> -Yes, I know Elysium, it's a good SF movie with Matt Damon

2017-01-19 21:40:59;Why are they only 1,800 bitcoins minted per day, and, in the same time, more than 31,000 ETH minted per day??? That' s not a fair game IMO...;"The greatest irony is your name, OP...Why does one have anything to do with the other? Why is it a game at all? Ethereum and Bitcoin are very different beasts. They have different uses and the different developers decided to set mining limits in different ways and to different amounts. Fair?
If i remember correctly from 2014 Ethereum raised $18 Million to build out the blockchain and fund the non-profit ethereum foundation. About 60 million ETH were given in return for this funding. Then under POW 31,000 ETH per day is given to miners who sell these into the market to pay their electricity bills. This spreads the ETH to a larger % of the population. People who weren't aware or involved in 2014/15/16/17 can buy them creating a larger community for Ethereum. The Roadmap was then to switch to POS in 2017/18ish, estimates by then there will be about 100 million ETH in existence. Once this switch to POS is done issuance of new ETH will be approx 1 -3% per year. Inline with general inflation. But it may be as low as 0%.

31,000 per day is good, My friends, family and work colleagues still get to buy in cheap as they see Ethereum evolve and get built by 1000's of Developers (actually estimated over 20,000) and i get to top up each month when my salary comes in.""1 Ether"" and ""1 Bitcoin"" are not really comparable. Well, they're comparable in that you can compare their prices, I guess, but what I mean is that it's a completely arbitrary unit.

Why not pretend that the basic unit of Ethereum is actually the MegaEther? That way only 0.033 MegaEther are minted each day. It's just as meaningful a way to look at things.Bitcoin is rare and getting more rare, so more sought after, and more valuable especially since it has a cap of 21mil. Supply and demand.... Ethereum is the opposite, so should not ever be used as a store of value, only as a cheap readily available programmable token. "

- It is believed that 30-50% of the current jobs done manually could be automated; in some fields that number could be much higher (this is what the reporter and the intreviewee discussed in the first 5 minutes)
- Buterin is praised as a blockchain genius and a bit of background was given
- Ethereum is seen as the main choice for solving the bank's problems of securing important documents while at the same time being fully transparent with its users (according to the spokesperson of the bank who we see interviewed at around the 7:30 mark)

Emphasis was placed on having transparency for all users, but it was vaguely worded to not give away if it's going to be on a public or private chain."

Think about it this way:

> A: Testnet Ether currently isn't worth anything.

Private Ethereum based blockchains run on the same technology as the main network. The only difference is who has access to the blockchain itself and what their ""Ether"" is worth. There are still nodes, there are still mining rewards, and yes gas still needs to be paid in the form of that blockchain's ""Ether"". That ""Ether"" just might have no monetary value at all.They will need gas to work with, but this gas or the ether is worthless(you don'the need to buy it). You can define for each user a big balance in the beginning(genesis) or hack the geth code to fix the difficulty, fee and the gas price as you need. "

But in order to interact with the blockchain you must be 100% synced. If you want to send, you must be synced, you can receive to your address still of course, it just won't display in your wallet until you are synced up to the block in which the transaction was in.

2017-02-16 21:52:08;When ETH goes POS, how will hardware wallet users stake?;"Nope, you have to lodge your ETH in a staking contract. As long as the node you're responsible for provides good information, you get paid interest. If your node behaves badly, the contract will keep some of your stake. It's your responsibility to ensure the node behaves according to the rules.I was thinking there could be a hardware solution. An Ethereum node, in a box. You plug in a network cable, and your usb hardware wallet, and power it up.

If this were to become standardised, it could have an FPGA in it, to accelerate functions like zk-snarks.As far as I know, an internet connection is required to stake in any way. 

Perhaps the security of a hardware wallet is the tradeoff for staking?  I'm sure there will be a way to hook up your wallet to the computer and stake via your PC, but without a PC/internet connection, you might just be SOL.I hope to see decentralized staking pools that are integrated with something like augur/gnosis One idea I've seen is to have two keys, one that runs the protocol and the other that's needed to withdraw funds, which would be your hardware wallet. A successful attacker could still make you lose money but at least couldn't directly steal it."

The incompatibility between GPLv3 and the App Store is [a point which I raised in my Ethereum Everywhere article](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/ethereum-everywhere/) last year.

We also had a pretty long discussion about it on one of the Gitter channels, with regard to Status which had recently switched from ethereumJ to geth, for the LES support.Let me play the devils advocate. Here we are trying to change the world with cryptocurrencies. Richard Stallman arguably started the whole ""free software"" movement and very specifically wrote the GPL to try to ensure software is truly free. When geth was written, the authors presumably agreed with this. Apple is acting in a way contrary to those values, therefore Apple loses out on the ability to offer geth based apps in their store.

2017-03-09 21:46:20;AKASHA newest release (0.5.2) and a quick update;"Hey everyone,

Writing a blogpost about this release felt too much but I’d like to share a quick update on what’s going on around our hacklab:

The code refactoring started with version 0.5.0 and is in full swing - things are looking great so far - we expect it to be completed by the end of Q2. This release (0.5.2) covers a major bug affecting non en-us users and a few smaller bug fixes. 

No shiny new features to show yet, but the wait will be worth it.

In the meantime, Marius has started working on the light client side and the initial results are very promising. We will test it thoroughly during the next few days and depending on the tests results we might include it in the next release(s). 

*insert frogdance .gif emoticon here*

We have some exciting things coming also on the design front that will be felt as an overall UI/UX improvement in AKASHA. These enhancements will be implemented *after* the refactoring stage is completed, and hopefully will make things even easier to use. On this note, the much anticipated AKASHA web-version will also come after this refactoring. 

On the collaboration side, during EDCON Paris I exchanged a few ideas with Vlad, Vitalik, Primavera and others regarding tokens, identity and reputation. It was great, things clicked, and in just a few days we’ll continue the brainstorming with Vlad in Bucharest - also called “the little Paris”.  

We’re all really looking forward to Vlad visiting us into our hacklab to continue our conversation - who knows what crazy ideas will take shape from this encounter!

We also aim to setup calls and explore integrations in the next week(s) with amazing projects such as the Status, uPort and SWARM. We feel that after these calls we will have a clearer idea on how we can collaborate and do great things together.  

After all, the “Ethereum way” is about **synergy** , and intuitively I think we all feel that there is *synergy* between our projects - it’s a matter of figuring out *where* and *how* to collaborate rather than *if*.

Aside from these highlights, we feel that the next weeks will be all about hard work that will come with hidden rewards in the form of a more modular dapp architecture and optimization in various stack layers that will solidify later into a stable foundation for AKASHA 1.0

In the end I’d like to thank everyone for testing AKASHA in such an early state and for the positive energy you’re sending our way through your support as a Community! 

If you have any questions about this release or AKASHA in general, I’m more than happy to answer them!Awesome news! Good job guys!There may not be a team in the space right now moving as fast as Akasha. Huge congrats guys!!Thank you."

This development and formalization of Casper protocols is the single most important thing going on in the space at the moment.

Congrats, eager for more!IMO your work is critical to Ethereum's success, because (for obvious reasons) smart contract code needs to be formally verified as much as possible.

A little off target given how popular myetherwallet is. Maybe by ""male"" you mean something else?> Technological developments historically have tended to remain the domain of the hobbyist - the male hobbyist - until women start to pick it up. That seems to be the signal of maturity and acceptance, and when mass take-up begins.

Why do you think it is this way round? Hasn't historically the influx of female usage of such technology simply been indicative of it beginning to leak into wider society outside of technologically competent communities?Masculine Monoculture?

Firstly, you assumed the gender binary status of the entire tech industry.

This is inherently sexist and part of the REASON why there are so few women in tech. The supposedly male tech population demonstrate very little masculine culture at all. Male animals in nature tend to be violent, anti-social, muscle bound, and sexually aggressive. Male techies are soft-spoken, gentle-natured, and collect comic books. Calling that masculine is not only problematic vis-a-vis binary gender non-fluidity, misidentifies masculinity, and creates psychological barriers to women who accept masculinity in tech as normative despite no authentic masculinity there.When we get close to 50/50 male female ratio within an organization, we reach pics of performance because men and women have different problem solving approach. (40/60 would do). How to get there. We pay women more? Why not"

Very easy to use. XMR doesn't work with any hardware wallets yet, but it is at least in consideration at Ledger. The problem is that it has a completely different codebase and wildly different cryptography, so it is harder to support. Don't expect XMR hardware wallet support for some time, but even the command line isn't too bad for a newbie, despite some intimidation factor. Especially if you just plan to hold, and not trade frequently."

2017-04-06 23:45:07;The ERC20 Short Address Attack Explained;"I think verifying any input from user should be the standard,
If im not mistaken all ethereum libraries has address validation to make sure address is in fact 40 hex characters long


    ethUtil.isValidAddress(""0x27c65a2e4ebcaf9b457028ffc771b2d5f7c06f39"")


> true


    ethUtil.isValidAddress(""0x27c65a2e4ebcaf9b457028ffc771b2d5f7c06f"")


> false

this is not just applicable to ethereum, no website should accept user inputs without proper validationGood article, but I disagree with this bit:

> This bug is compounded by Ethereum's decision to not add an in-band checksum on addresses. Bitcoin, for instance, has a checksum at the end of every address so any client can validate that the address is correct. This was a good idea in 2009, and it's a good idea now. In this particular case, the address stays valid at each step, but it is not valid as offered. There is no way to check for this validity right now.

While a checksum would be a definite improvement, it's not true that ""there is no way to check for this validity"" - a simple length check would have worked here!The article is nicely explaining the issue but I think the title is misleading. The attack would have been against a particular exchange's token hot wallet due to lack of input sanitization. It's not an ERC20 attack.

As others have already said a simple address length check would have been sufficient to address this.This isn't anymore of an attack than PHP include vulnerabilities. It's up to the programmers to verify user inputs."

Open source communication + Ethereum = <3I've always been wondering if there are some form of mesh/short range devices that could be used in conjunction with storing data on the block chain using sharding and processing power that gives incentives to leave device nodes on like GOLEM which makes the stored shared data constantly updated to all users simultaneously on the block chain network which could then result in the internet being decentralized?

Edit: right now the net is centralized because data is stored in physical servers owned by certain entities so all the govt had to do is compelling those entities within their jurisdiction to filter/deny access.

So if data is actually stored and propagated simultaneously by everyone on the network, it's not possible for a government to pinpoint a certain entity to shut it down save for using a super huge EMP bomb to fry all devices of the public?"

2017-04-13 19:03:59;Ethereum vs Dash;"[deleted]hi Faghe 
I'm an Ethereum developer/investor and am also involved in the Dash community. 

Dash has great marketing in that they make their product (wallet) super easy to use and are aggressively reaching out to the masses with education and ways to get them on board as users.  They are moving to collateralized miners which should help keep them scalable near term.  Unfortunately, whenever I write about positive attributes of Dash here, I get downvoted severely.

Although Ethereum is still catching up to Dash in making payments easy, it's got an extended community of organizations and developers doing amazing things in many areas, not just payments.  Overall, Ethereum leverages developers worldwide in ways that I believe no one else will catch up with. 

This topic is very broad.  I'm not aware of extensive compare and contrast between the two.  I hope this short opinion helps.Ethereum a box full of parts that work and developers use, Dash a shiny box full of parts .. with a well marketed box.. i dont know really if anything in Dash works, its centralized too isnt it or a ponzi scheme.?. doesn't sit well..overhyped maybe..

But the Op is asking a good question, because its a wake-up call... Begging the question, how good is Ethereum public relations outreach anyways or ease of use?

Edit, yes like you i can run Linux, apt.  geth generate an account, save my keys..
But do you think everyone will be willing to do that? UX ppl UXThe general atmosphere around Dash is that of a ponzi-like scheme. The aggressive marketing aimed purposely at attracting dumb money, the conscious efforts to reduce supply as much as possible to artificially increase its price, and most of all, the very dodgy 'accidental' instamine followed by a quick rebrand rather than a reboot. Too many red flags for me.

Edit: Here's an awkward video of them responding to an instamine question: https://youtu.be/0EG2km7GAmM?t=2834dash is an instamined scam. there is no comparison[deleted]When we convert to POS i belive in nothing."

I was just thinking of ways to make some entertaining Ethereum videos. 

You could possibly have a video of yourself explaining Ethereum to different types of people - a 5 year old kid (actual ELI5), your grandma, a stranger off the street, etc and see their questions and reactions. I think it'd be entertaining, funny, and educational :)Thats cool. How about just wearing a Ethereum tee-shirt for every vidSo much love! Thank you (:It would be great to have videos introducing various aspects of the platform. Are there topics that particularly interest you? One short video for each of these topics would be really helpful IMO:

- what ethereum basically is
- who's who in the community
- major organizations, projects, and companies
- what kinds of things ethereum is used for, will be used for
- ethereum, swarm, whisper
- using mist, using just the wallet
- options for how to run ethereum: geth, parity, metamask
- options for how to run ethereum on your phone
- best practices for securing your ether, dealing with your keystore and password
- how to develop a dapp

Any ideas for other topics?

I guess it makes no sense to create a upload a video which does not resonate with the viewers of Callux. Looking at your channel, maybe interviews with normal people, trying to get them to accept Ether might be fun. Trying to convince people it is not a prank ;) . Sounds like a huge challenge to keep it fun. 

Another option would be helping out to make existing information/videos more accessible. Knowing how to reach an audience can be worthwhile. 

That's what I can come up with.

Tell em all that playing etheroll will add 3"" to there dicks ;-)I'd say it is the philosophical, psychological, political stuff that would ultimately be the most useful.

1. Interject small jokes and expressions making fun of fiat or paper money, i.e. ""Ugh I wish they paid me in ether but I guess that dollar will do for now lol"", ""What is that? Government money? Thanks but no thanks, come back when you have bitcoin, kthxbye!""

2. If your format allows, make a video about how wars run until treasury runs dry, and most/all big wars in history were only possible due to fiat money/inflation/debasement. Morals: if you use crypto, you are contributing to not having a war in the next 1000 years.

3. More jokes and hints about how state violence makes everything inefficient and people miserable.


tl/dr: I think you'd be best serving yourself, us and entire humanity by focusing on the real important promises of blockchain technology  rather than on one specific brand. Note: I'm a devout Etherean, don't take me wrong here.

EDIT: checked your channel. FFS dude you are popular. You know you can contribute to saving the world, right?

EDIT2: Somehow just showing people ""Look! You can spend Bitcoin on Amazon in literally one click via Bitpay app. You can buy gift cards via egifter/gyft and spend them in Starbucks/eBay/whatever. You can buy shit on Newegg/Dell with crypto. You can refill your (or anyones!) phone via Bitrefill with Ether, and it is somehow a bit cheaper then paying in dollars"". I know that is the opposite of entertaining, but showing 1m people that crypto has real value and is usable, like, right now would have a tremendous long-term impact.Write and share beginners guides about Ethereum and the impact it's going to have.Wow, the potential...  it's awesome that you're willing to extend your brand into this area--because the number of ways it can flop are infinite (I won't link to any particular ones, but search ""bitcoin comedy"" on youtube is what I mean).

Early bitcoin demos were of people sending large amounts like $1M to each other on cell phones. That's simple but impressive. Or get someone in Zimbabwe or something to receive the money that you send, hook them up with a webcam to show it. You could do the in and out of the exchanges to show the full money transmit process. Or show the gambling, or the trading. Those are the main apps now that could catch on.

What do you think about the naming/branding? ""Ethereum"" is a challenge for the wider audience such as your 2M subscribers. ETH (like ""eeth"") could work, or ether (""eether""). I think ""coin"" is done in by bitcoin. ""token"" is a possibility.

I've thought about putting up billboards a year or two from now. Maybe:

2017-04-27 22:28:56;If you can successfully explain how to transfer Ether from my wallet to my exchange I will send you 1 ETH (~$60);"Hey Jeff,

So from what you are describing, I am assuming you are using Ethereum Wallet (Mist)? Many people are reporting to have problem syncing with the rest of the network, but don't worry there are solutions. If you want to transfer from your Ethereum Wallet, then yes you would need to sync the chain first, but there are other ways that you might find less painful.

So here's a simple solution, as hinted by maxxflyer. 

1. Go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/#send-transaction
2. Select ""Keystore File (UTC/JSON)
3. Click on “Select Your Wallet File”. Your wallet file should be located somewhere at '/home/USERNAME/.ethereum/keystore' where USERNAME is your computer account username. There should be one (or more) file looking like 'UTC--2016--....', which is your keystore File. 
You will see if you selected the right address since the amount of ETH you have should be indicated on the left. 
4. Type in your Exchange address in the ‘To Address’ section
5. Put the amount to send 
6. Generate Transaction to send your Ethers to your exchange account. 

If you don’t know what your exchange address is, I would need to know what exchange you are using. Usually you have to go in the Funding or Deposit section after loging in your exchange. Then, when you specify you want to deposit ETH, it will usually show you an address or ask you to generate a New Address. Create a new address if needed or copy the existing one. This is your exchange address. I would recommend sending something small (0.1 ether for eg) just to make sure it works first.

Hope this works and let me know if you have more questions! Note the myetherwallet is totally safe and is used widely. It also doesn’t require you to download (and therefore sync) the blockchain. Are you talking about Mist?
what is the address of your wallet? 
you can export your utc files and open them using myetherwallet.com and from there you send your eth wherever you wantif you still need help, feel free to DM.  you don't have to pay me0x27B6b932Fe8115B3114b07DDBD5CB8e2C32aBEB8

2017-05-11 22:45:29;Why does Ethereum shy away from being seen as a currency?;"Because saying Ethereum is money is like saying the internet is a file transfer service.   Sure, it can do that, but it's not the selling point or even really a very significant part of it.Because fees are too high???  ;)I believe that Ethereum can be used to manage money just as well and in many cases better than other digital currencies including Bitcoin.  That said, Ethereum can also do much more than just function as a currency.  I think a lot of people want to highlight the fact that Ethereum can do and is much more, but it can also be used as a true digital currency.

We're already seeing cases where Ether is used as money today, but I also believe we'll start seeing new Ethereum based tokens set up to replace existing government backed (or other) currency at some point in the future.  A lot of people are under the false impression that just because Ethereum deviates from Bitcoin's path on some issues, it has to be the anti-Bitcoin and reject everything associated with Bitcoin. These people have created a narrative where Bitcoin failed because it didn't get a good reputation with banks, when in reality, the only thing that stood in the way of Bitcoin's mass adoption was the block size cap.

I think ETH can succeed where BTC failed, and become the currency of the internet, with scaling, on top of succeeding where Bitcoin could not, with advanced smart contract functionality.Because they don't govern money, they govern trust or rather they govern a system that does not require trust, which is far more valuable than money. Imagine if fuel (or food) is easy to transfer and store as money, then no one need money, its liquidity is even better than money because everyone needs them or at least you need fewer intermediaries when you use fuel to buy another thing.It was a strategy to make Bitcoin ignore ETH so that they didn't implement its features and kill it off.

It would have been bad if ETH had said ""We're gonna replace Bitcoin !"" because Bitcoin might have got its act together and tried to stop ETH.

Instead ETH was like ""oh, nothing to see here... don't worry...""  and it's been working great.

Might as well keep the charade up as long as possible!Are there are any properties of money that bitcoin has that ether lacks?"

The only way the superowner can control the contract is if a) the superuser is set and b) the owner is not set.

This prevents you from transferring ownership of the contract to another person, since `owner` and `superowner` are mutually exclusive. Put another way, if `superowner` *and* `owner` are set, `owner` takes precedence.  This also means the `owner` can set themselves as the `superowner` and take control of the contract, etc.

Let's take ens-registrar-dapp as an example;"A DApp is composed of several parts, normally a client-side UI ( running on the user computer) and a smart contract backend, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Typically, you would use [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API), the Ethereum JavaScript API library to interface your client-side code with the smart contract layer. The ENS registrar application works as described and  it is a full fledged DApp. An application that has its core processing logic on the blockchain is a DApp. It doesn't matter if the interface is on the chain or not. 


If an application is a DApp, you can directly interact with it on the blockchain without a centralized interface. 


In the case of ENS, the ENS devs provide their own interface (the one you linked to); MEW built their own interface for it. Both interface are intercting with the smart contract on the blockchain. "

We REALLY need a decent, reliable, secure wallet like Electrum for BTC. Until then you have two options, wait for the blockchain to finish or start again using the fast option. Good luck.If you know how to use the command line, there are much faster ways to sync a full node. With parity (my client of choice), it is `parity --warp`. With geth, I believe it is `geth --fast`.

Geth also has a light client, which you can use with `geth --light`. This will sync in less than a minute.

Your other option is to use a zero client, which requires no syncing at all. Check out myetherwallet.com or metamask.ioKinda late to this but  I was having similar frustrations.
I installed the command line tools from here:
https://ethereum.org/cli

and things seem to be going faster.

I'm using the command  geth --fast --cache 1024

Using the GUI for the initial install was ridiculously, agonizingly slow.   I'll probably use it for maintaining the block chain though.

2017-06-01 23:37:23;"Does 1 ETH ""weigh"" as much as 1,000 ETH?";"The amount of ETH is just a number.  A simple example:  1 byte in architectures (8 bits) can encode/store values 0 to and including 255, which are 256 (2^8[bits] ) distinct values.  A value of 1 or 234 or 135 all take up the same space to encode the value.  

AFAIK, the datatype that encodes/stores the amount of ETH is a fixed-width type.  Whatever the (fixed) length of that variable is, should store all possible amounts of ETH.


Addendum:
""I have 10000 US dollars.""
""I have 00050 US dollars.""

In the English language, those sentences mean different things and for us (computers understanding the English language), we see they encode different values.  But in the end, the sentence length is the same.  Computers understand ""math"" language well.  I guess that is a decent analogy.No, the numbers are stored as (sorry I'm too lazy to look it up now) either 32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit or 256-bit integers, so all balances are the same in that regard.

Any transfer transaction costs a fixed 21000 gas.

Also, please remember that how much space something takes on blockchain likely matters way less then a) transaction history b) gas price to make that transaction."

I just thought of something that could increase awareness.  I wonder if a message like this could be added to the output of geth (the CLI mining tool):

** IMPORTANT: Note that Proof of Work (PoW) mining is temporary. See roadmap for details on forthcoming switch to Proof of Stake (PoS) ***

Anything that raises awareness in advance is likely to reduce friction when the switch actually happens.Because of the difficulty bomb, in order to stay on POW someone will need to code a modified Ethereum implementation and convince people to use it. The users will be forced to choose between POS and POW, they can't just do nothing and stay on POW.

Users will choose the network that benefits them more. The POS fork will have a faster tx time, lower issuance, and future scaling capability.

Also, we don't need miners to switch, anyone with an average PC can participate in POS.We miners could very well decide not to fork, however mining follows profit and if the value of the not forked ether stayed high, that means the community as a whole would have to reject the fork. I don't see that happening because of the benefits of pos and all that they plan on doing post that fork. I think it's fine to plan things assuming there will be someone somewhere keeping alive the PoW fork (with the associated fix to the difficulty bomb as others noted). This fork could either be either the same or different from ETC.

ETH is robust against this, it will just continue on with almost assuredly the majority of economic value since this is all been on the roadmap."

2017-06-22 23:48:38;What Would Decentralized Business Models Look Like?;"There are many ways but the easiest way to understamd is you build something on top of the eth network and then offer consulting. Take golem for example. Golem doesn't charge any fees. What they are going to do is offer consulting from their devs to other devs as well as build other applications on top of the golem network that they can charge for.

Ethereum isn't really a platform to launch thousands of new hot tech startups. In my opinion I see it as a very powerful tool that will help companies save money. Yes, tons of startups will launch on ethereum, but because it's decentralized, 99% of them will fail. Especially because if you try to charge a fee, someone will fork your code and charge less of a fee. Just like open source projects help a ton of companies, ethereum is the largest open source project that you can actually profit off of by buying ether.Why doesn't we figure it out together? :)

Blockchain is not only about removing middle man, but lowering (or eliminating) the amount of trust required between parties and to provide additional transparency.

Think inside the block! ;)I think ICOs are not necessary to monetize a decentralized businessmodel. One model that I made a proof of concept for is a simple ""bank-like"" derivative product. Monetization is done by a small comission. The issuer of the smart contracts (like the issuer of a deriative product like an investment bank) needs to inject a high amound of Ether as ""core capital"" that needs to be hold to ensure customers get their Ethers and potential gains. Did publish my idea and the dApp on my website http://www.chainify.io.

The dApp in a nutshell:

1. You can go Long (call) or Short (put) on the EUR/USD.

2. Your Ether and the potential gains are protected in the „most trustless“ way (by injected capital)

3. The issuer of the smart contract injects sufficient Ether for that protection.

4. Longs and Shorts are backed by frozen Ether in the Smart Contract. This is like a core capital ratio in banks. This capital ratio should suffice for extreme volatility scenarios. In my POC, I simply set 200%, even though that might be too much.

5. With increasing number of transactions, more and more Ether amounts are frozen in the Smart Contract to protect users Ether and potential gains. If all the Smart Contract's Ether are frozen, newtransactions are impossible. Only existing holders can close their positions. Only if positions are closed, the freed Ether can be used for new transactions. Or the issuer injects more Ether.

Wanna try?

Have some more thought and link to the dApp on http://www.chainify.io

Btw: the dApp runs on IPFS.

What do you think?

Just to clarify: this is weekend hacking. No perfect code. Just fun programming, fan of Ethereum and constantly thinking about simple Ethereum use cases.
If you deploy a smart contract, you could try charging people ETH to use it. But how that ETH would get split among a team of contract developers is not really clear. 

Outside if the blockchain space, there are software cooperatives like [enspiral](https://enspiral.com).Over time Linux beat Windows. Wikipedia beat encyclopedia.com and public services built on ethereum for free by developers in their spare time will beat privately owned services that charge users, steal their data or force feed them adverts.**Lower cost redux**
Ethereum allows a lower entry cost for newcomers to build infrastructure: backend, security, authentication, immutable data, ...

**Transparency of transactions and accountability**
 Ethereum network can 'host' Kickstarter type activities and allow the next steps beyond with verifiable, value accounting and cashback flow all accessible on the Blockchain.

**Coin operated machines**
 that is the elusive model holy grail many seek. What's missing is the 'black box' enclosure to 'hide' the inner workings. Ethereum Blockchain contracts are 'glass boxes' instead. So a decentralized/ centralized' hybrid assymetrical trust may make sense: hiding production logic in centralized servers while using transparent blockchain for Tx and accountabilityI think a discussion is needed, because as I see it, the whole promise isn't being delivered.

##failed promises

1) decentral

Most business models do not even bother to create real decentralization, as they proudly get in the way between the user and the product to charge their fees

2) trustless

A feeble attempt is made, usually in the form of a ""smart contract"", a decoration at best, as it usually cements the middle man, also up to know the ecosystem is lacking a trustless/decentral end-user interface, which makes it almost impossible for the average Joe to interact with the system in a meaningful way without having to trust intermediaries.

3) cheaper

ICOs show theirs a big price to pay to get even a basic functionality going, and promise a chunk of the future fee, reminding of highwayman. Exchanges are bathing in money. All of this is valuable money being ""taken away"" from the system.


##follow the money

Structures build on ethereum right now are proportional to the money involved, and ""big money"" (middlemen) are interested in fostering the flow of money into their pockets. All exchanges are a striking example to the fact, that on the layer of the end user experience, nothing has really changed.

Whats different in the end, is the security layer, as it gets more difficult to tamper with the data, if different parties are involved, but thats it. 

##the enterprise level

Whats indeed changing are structures at enterprise level, especially with banks. They have an incentive to automate and decentralize their infrastructures, and make it cheaper as well. If there will be real change for the end user remains to be seen, but ironically the change may be a top-down one, not bottom-up, and the big companies will do everything to stay relevant, while the less educated are entertained with bread and circuses style ICOs. 

Additionally, people themselves are not interested in having the middle men removed, because middle men provide a valuable service (trust, knowledge, etc), which up to now hasn't been replaced at all by technology. Take the middle men away, and you get chaotic ICOs like Status, the Wild West, which is indeed very exciting, but the majority of people want things to be simply working, and they are willing to pay for it."

2017-06-22 23:26:36;The recent Ethereum backlog has me wondering about sharding and other long-term scaling propositions. I understand these are by no means simple, but is it possible to move them higher up on the priority list? Or are they already pretty much top priority?;"I think it's probably fair to say it's the top priority for Ethereum devs.

State channels are the most likely to happen first. They're basically doable right now so Foundation devs aren't focusing on that, they're leaving it to dapp developers.

Sharding is the ultimate long-term solution.It's top priority. There aren't enough people alive who have the technical skills to participate in proof of stake and sharding theory. There's Vitalik, vlad, and just a handful of others.  I wish people understood that a priority only makes sense if the work isn't parallelizable. Sharding is infinitely more complex than PoS. And yes theorically sharding pretty much fixes any scaling issue, but it also means you need to consider tree-balancing strategies as well as partial-knowledge trust while assuming some nodes are acting in bad faith. It's very much not trivial to address all of this.If we didn't have to mine all the failed transactions, we'd have a lot less blockchain bloat, and fewer capacity issues. How many of the transactions causing the backlog actually resulted in someone buying Status tokens, and how many ended with a throw inside the ICO contract and no effect other than expended gas?

The point of having failed transactions still consume gas is to impose a cost on people trying to waste the world computer's time by making nodes do useless computations. But when imposing that cost ends up causing more problems for the system than just letting people off would, we should maybe think about changing things.

If the network had a policy allowing non-throwing transactions to jump the queue ahead of throwing ones, that might help. Self-interested miners are going to want to mine the throwing transactions first and pocket the gas fees, though.Sorry if this has been answered, but I looked everywhere and could not find it.  Is there any **official announcement from the Ethereum project** as of what is the cause of the network delays?
The lack of transparency only hurts the project. As I recall transaction capacity and speed was one of the main promises of the ethereum project. And now no one says anything... very bad..

Once you've installed `solc`, the Solidity compiler, you can compile your Solidity smart contract code simply with `solc YourContract.sol`.

If you want to write tests for your contracts and interact with the blockchain, you might want to take a look at [pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum). YMMV but I find this is a much more comfortable way to develop contract code than the JavaScript stuff.

That said, the normal way to make a DApp - an *application* that other people use and that talks to your contracts on the blockchain is to create static HTML to run in the browser, and for that there's not much getting around JavaScript. > Are there compiled tools I can use from a normal Mac terminal?

The only thing altered by the fork was the Dao itself (including splits)There was no rollback. There were some ETH sitting in a specific contract, that due to the conditions of the contract couldn't be moved for a month or so. The fork added an extra state change (think of it like an extra transaction that wouldn't normally be allowed) that moved these ETH from that contract to another contract.

A more interesting question with tokens is what's going to happen when someone needs to fork not the entire blockchain, but a specific individual token. In principle if the users of the token agree, you can simply deploy a new contract, set it up with the balances listed in the previous contract and ask everyone to use the address of the new contract instead of the old one. However, weird things will happen if you've got funds controlled by another contract, like a betting contract or a decentralized exchange: The contract ends up owning funds in the new token contract, but it may not know who they belong to or what to do with them.

Rootstock relies on people holding your coins and promising to move them where the smart contracts say; it's several companies holding your coins in multisig but still. Bitcoin also has nothing remotely like Ethereum's scaling plan. 

A year ago Bitcoin had a huge advantage in mindshare but now, there's not such a huge difference. Ethereum shows up in mainstream news all the time, plus we've got the EEA.

But things seem to be looking up for Bitcoin at the moment. I think there's room for all of us. The legacy economy is the real competition, and it's way bigger than all cryptos put together.Why would anyone use rootstock and let miners hold their bitcoins for them? It goes against the most basic principle in crypto - if you don't control your private key , you don't own the bitcoin.

We're from AdEx Network and we're offering our help: we have 2 developers with 10+ programming experience  (one of them me) who can help audit the code. I'm going to dig right into it.

Please PM me or write to ivo@adex.network if you need anything else.

Also, may I ask why the OpenZeppelin multisig is not considered?Do you have a location for the tests that cover Wallet.sol?I appreciate the initial rescue, as well as the transparency in choosing which multisig contract to go forward with. I'm glad you're including Gavin Wood, as I'm sure he's feeling pretty bad about all of this.

A point: anyone who doesn't like your choice will be able to move to another wallet contract (assuming no world-ending bugs in your replacement contract).I disagree.. use the Gnosis Multisig, the design is far cleaner and it's not that young.. it has been up for months now without issue, and audited by my count 7 independent audits, and multiple bug-bounties (for the same code base).

Anyway, thanks for saving the community.. may the crypto-god be with you =DReview of the code posted here: https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/issues/69

We're still doing some checks & still looking at it, but for now it's that

No critical issues discovered, some minor ones should be discussedThank you all for everything you have done for the Ethereum community! line 61 ` m_owners[1 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);` 
- why 1+i? Why position 0 is kept empty? 
- why this casting to uint? 

It would be awesome if the mods took initiative like this for other critical contracts, I wonder what the sticky policy is

> **The Oracle Wars**

> The next battleground for decentralization will undoubtedly be around oracles (after all, control of the oracle amounts to control of the entire contract, when execution depends on external data in any way). In other words, oracles represent a “centralization chokepoint” threat to many different types of smart contracts, including those for prediction markets. Though we’re not seeing antagonistic oracle-based control exerted today, if any of the decentralized prediction markets start to enjoy any sort of significant success (whether this is Augur, Gnosis, Delphi, or another project entirely), it will inevitably prompt efforts to compromise or centralize the oracles involved.
We won’t risk letting our hard work go to waste by ignoring this threat. Delphi’s focus will be totally dedicated to the oracle component. Our strategy on this front will allow us to bootstrap our oracle networks, receive revenue as we grow, and benefit from the efforts of our competitors.

> **How Pythia Fits In**
The [Pythia oracle framework](https://medium.com/@Delphi_Markets/a-glimpse-of-pythia-731df5fc7972) is a linchpin of our strategy. By providing robust distributed oracle models, tools, and formal analysis, we expect to lay the foundations for a thriving oracle ecosystem. Eventually, we expect Pythia to evolve into a full-fledged Oracle Marketplace (though this would likely be over the long-term, and certainly not part of Phase One of our Master Plan). We intend to take full advantage of our own platform and tools. Pythia creates new revenue models (after all, oracles require incentives), and we will leverage this opportunity to generate profits and finance our project’s growth by participating as an oracle service provider ourselves.





I honestly think this is going to be **the** crypto prediction market. It's the most strategic and thorough look at the tech yet. And look at [how well distributed](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe2f0a2d25639366b19e4105068720837277e70f) the tokens are as opposed to the gnosis model of 95% for them and 5% for the people. I'm a full fledged pierced nosed bull at this pointSo their ICO raised a grand total of 830 Ether?they are publishing their white paper after the ICO.

not ok.
**Careful**, this is probably a scam:

- The have the largest referral bonus I have heard of. That's why you got users like /u/aidenbo or /u/RothbardRand polluting every Delphi-thread with glowing comments. They even got their [announcement thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2003548.20) on bitcointalk locked because of this.

- no one knows the team, they are anonymous (because... reasons). Very... transparent. Just like thin air.

- they are using trademarks (Delphi, Oracle), and one is from one of the most litigious companies there is. 

A fool and his money... you know the rest. 

- they simply cloned the Gnosis code to have a github repo. I.e. there's nothing to show.""Master Plan"" indeed. Super impressive...you don't see many ico's with actual legit revenue models these days. 

These guys are a level up from the others in the space, IMO.Are there even developers on this project? As far as I can tell they copied Gnosis repository and then right away started an ICO.

>Other industries could include real estate — doing escrow or title insurance. When you buy a home, you have to pay $300-$400 to an escrow agent so they can clear the title for you, but really, all they do is go to the county office and make sure there’s no fraud on the title history. The blockchain can do that because it can store the history of who owned a particular house since it was first built, and that record is stored in a way that cannot be tampered with. With a blockchain, when you time stamp a particular document or service or ownership, that time stamp cannot be changed. That is the key difference between a blockchain and a database. In a database, you can erase a record and change the value and no one would know you did that because not all databases have an audit trail — you have no history of what was changed when it was changed. But that’s a basic, basic, basic element of a blockchain. So every time there is a new state, you don’t erase the previous state, you add a line below it like a ledger. You don’t erase the previous line and replace it. Then you have a good truthful, historical record of anythingThree factors. 

The first is that possession and title are two different things.  While blockchain can be the ledger of record for title, the physical world is the ledger of record for possession.   

Second, the blockchain does not (yet) have capacity to modify state of actors in the physical world (such as possession), whereas actors in the physical world can modify state on the blockchain.

Third, ""finality"" is a problem of indeterminate duration.  So for a non-zero period of time, there is a non-zero probability that blockchain state can appear to be coherent with physical-world state, and then ultimately turn out to be incoherent.   "

There is a vocal minority of a few active people that raise concerns and are not satisfied by a “rationalization just designed to support the issuance reduction”, something that is usually just called an argument (by anyone else and also by themselves in any other situation). I do not think that it is a good idea to get hooked up in endless discussions. I for one support the issuance reduction to 3 ETH - I think a) that security of the network is not at risk by doing this step, b) that it can be seen as a first step towards PoS by reducing the mining rewards per block (reducing the incentive to block the transition to PoS and also keeping the total issuance before PoS under control), c) it is (or should be) acceptable to miners since the “reward per second” is not reduced at the time of implementation, and yes d) it will stabilise (or at least lower bound) the price of ETH, which is certainly also good for the ecosystem.

I did some research - and didn't find any ready-to-run solutions for Arduino - which sounded great, because its a simple chip, and doesn't even has a complex OS to hack (like Raspberri Pi does).


So, I quickly developed my pitch for the world and created this website, describing the key idea:

http://paranoidwallet.com/


Current status:
- There are some cryptographic libraries for Arduino already (although I want them to be compatible with a low-end ATmega328 which has only 2k SRAM and 32k Flash) - such as ECDSA elliptic curves, and Keccak-256.
- There is also a great random generator based on crystal oscillations, which gives you pretty much cool randomness.
- The creators of MEW on github already had started porting Ethereum libs to Arduino - 2 years ago (and I surely will be asking them questions and beg for help).


But as I've said - I wanted a ready-to-use product, and also want security experts to audit it (by using a bounty or reddit crowd-brain).


But the only thing missing is - time & money. Which are tightly interconnected, btw.
So, I was hoping that if somebody would be also interested in this cryptomaniac product for paranoiacs - I could get some donations to free up some time to work on this project full-time.

Ideally - run an ICO (ha-ha). But nothing funny - Ethereum webpage states Token Sales as a primary crowd-funding mechanism, so nothing to be ashamed of.


**What I want now is general public opinion about the idea.
And comments from other developers and security experts on the tech part.**


P.S. I also have a lot of ideas on how to develop the project further than a simple wallet-generator. It can be an open-sourced alternative to Trezor. I want it to be able to sign transactions without any physical contact with PC (via sound or light sensors). The Sketch uploading can be made safer if you upload it via iOS app or even some hardware RS232 uploader. Or just check if PC upload isn't compromised via simple COM-port logger.

Shouldn't this be web 3.0?Apart from the 'Ethereum' vs 'Ether' mistake, your understanding is completely wrong. Ethereum is first and foremost a decentralized cloud computer. The cryptocurrency portion only applies when you are discussing Ether, the tokens used to pay for the computational power to use and run the Ethereum virtual machine.

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, but the two differ drastically.

The Ethereum 'coin' (amounts of which are known as 'ether') is used to pay for gas in order to run these decentralized applications (Dapps)

Web 3.0? Ajax and similar systems seem to be the defining features of web 2.0.

If you agree with these changes let us know and I'll continue to proof it more thoroughly when i knock off work in a few hours. Either way, good work, its a dense topic and guides are a great thing :)Very nice article, thank you for it.One element that many beginners don't understand is that ""Ethereum is an [application] platform built on blockchain technology."" You mention it's ""like bitcoin and blockchain"", but this statement needs to be more accurate. 

I know for many, there's a huge disconnect as to what a blockchain even is and the potential it has for the future, let alone what Ethereum is. Perhaps not necessarily something that needs to be gone into depth in this article, but it should be mentioned right away and linked to a high-level guide as to what the technology is in the first place. ""If the term blockchain is alien, then take a look at this dope infographic, then come back"". 

To understand how a house is built, you can't gloss over that there's a foundation.

Otherwise, I think you're onto something!

Feels a bit like ancient history now, but Ehrsam does a great job explaining what separates Bitcoin and Ethereum in an ELi15 sort of way. Not to be a wet blanket, but should this be taken down until the article is revised to be more accurate?I'm an average person looking to understand 
Ethereum. I read the article and I can't say that I do. I think part of it is because your writing style is difficult to follow and the article is just, overall, poorly written. The ""gas"" concept seems really forced and I didn't really get it. Using that analogy just made it more confusing for me.I have to sign in to read his article. Instant nope from me."

2017-09-14 21:38:52;Warning, Warning, NEVER USE ETHER FreeWallet for investing Ether.;"The feels bro, the feels.yea i hear you they had different addresses when i printed my private key and address i used my private key to open my wallet and the address in there was different to the one i printed lolWell most ICOs tell you explicitly which wallets work...pay attentionTo be explicit 

myetherwallet is a free wallet but is not created by the company Freewallet.  Myetherwallet gives you full control over your wallet and tokens.**stwbitcoin**, first of all, we'd like to apologize for the lack of information provided by our support reps. Perhaps if we explain the way our wallets work, it would answer part of your questions about why the tokens you had purchased didn't land in the wallet address you see in the app. 

The address displayed in your app is a so-called ""hot wallet"" used for receiving transactions. Keeping the funds there as well as storing your private keys locally could be a risk because if the access to your device is compromised, it would give a hacker an opportunity to steal your assets. That is why after you've received a transaction, the funds are moved to the cold storage. Whenever you need to make a transaction, your funds are transferred from the cold storage as well and are sent out of a service wallet address like the one you mentioned, ending in E59. 

Your actual balance is displayed in your app; what you see on a blockchain explorer is most likely an intermediary transfer of funds in/out of the cold storage. Please note that you aren't charged with any fees for such transactions. Thanks to the cold storage technology, even if your phone gets lost or stolen, you can easily access your wallet using another device. 

Most ICOs simply send tokens to the address they received the payment for them from. That's why when you purchased tokens, they ended up being sent to our service wallet address. In order to identify your transactions and deliver the tokens to you, our support reps requested the hashes for these token transactions to our service wallet. As you've mentioned yourself, quite a number of different tokens were sent there, so we need some ids to pick the ones that were sent for you, not for other users. Perhaps if you could contact the ICOs you participated in, they'd be able to provide you with these details?

Last year, when you started participating in ICOs, token support wasn't enabled in Freewallet at all, which was specifically mentioned in the [Terms of Use](https://freewallet.org/terms) and our [knowledge base article](https://freewallet.org/support/knowledgebase/contracts-and-advanced-protocols/). We only wish you contacted us prior to participating in ICOs like we suggested: it would have helped avoid the current situation. We are, however, willing to help retrieve the tokens for you; all we need is the additional information only you can provide.   "

2017-10-05 21:42:50;What's after GPU mining?;"Soon(tm) is about a year, in this case.

Ethereum is going to move away from proof-of-work entirely, so no GPUs or ASICs or any other giant warehouses full of hardware churning away. It's going to Proof of Stake instead.

Proof of Stake is a bit complex and has a lot of details, but it can basically be summarized as follows. Various stakers will submit a big pile of Ether (ie, money) to a smart contract that will randomly assign blocks to them to validate based on how big their stake is (bigger stakers get more blocks to validate). Validation means running the transactions, updating the blockchain state, and then putting a cryptographic ""stamp of approval"" on it to indicate that the staker vouches that the block has been validated correctly. Validating a block and generating a signature doesn't take much computing power, it can be done with a standard desktop PC.

Anyone else can double-check whether the block was really validated correctly, and if it turns out that it wasn't (the staker made a mistake or was trying to pull a fast one) then the smart contract running the show can be shown proof of this and the staker's money will be burned. They lose their stake. So a lot of money is riding on getting validation right, and thus you can put a lot of trust in it.Lots of different approaches. In the case of Ethereum it currently uses proof of work (pow). You want to read up on proof of stake (pos) which is what it will switch to."

2017-10-05 21:30:50;Using blockchain to store education certificates that are signed by at least two people. Is this possible to do on Ethereum?;"Totally doable; turing completeness and all that.

You're correct in thinking that uploading an image or something to the ethereum blockchain is ridiculously expensive; it is, and for good reason. What most people are doing to store large amounts of data in a decentralized manner is using IPFS (which is ""free"" for now, but will eventually use filecoin) or Swarm (which is slightly further behind in development). Your frontend code submits this data to your storage network of choice and your smart contract just stores the address of that content.

For number 2, a signature is pretty much anything you want it to be, as long as it proves that someone has control over a specific public key. In this case, simply executing a transaction on the contract would satisfy that idea. So perhaps you have the sender upload a document of the certificate, which is stored on IPFS/swarm and identifies a recipient by ethereum address. This recipient can then ""claim"" the certification by executing, say, a `claim` function on your contract. 

This is also very close to how multisignature wallets work; check out the code for the gnosis multisig wallet https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet/ to see what it's actually doing. It's not magic.

I'd recommend reading https://medium.com/@mattcondon/getting-up-to-speed-on-ethereum-63ed28821bbe to get up to speed on the foundations of ethereum, especially if you want to build this.

Also, look into existing ""notary"" ethereum projects; this is effectively the exact same use case.http://opencertificates.co/"

2017-10-12 22:52:22;EOS might be a money laundering scheme - Suspicious activity inside;"There are plenty of other signs that EOS is a huge scam. 

They have been funneling their own Ethereum into the ICO since the very beginning. Their two goals are probably keeping a high market cap and minting money like you said.

Dan Larimer is a criminal. I expect to see him prosecuted for fraud within the next two years.SEC has already paid special attention on EOS, soon they gonna be busted.The 0 address is the ethereum burn address.  Send money there to never see it again.When an ERC20 token is minted, you can state it comes from 0000....0000 in a Transfer Event. Many of the default ICO contracts work exactly like that. That way you can broadcast the Transfer Event so that tools like Etherscan will show you the token creation transfer as well as the normal ERC20 transfers.

The ICO contracts that don't send the Transfer Event from 000....000 look a bit strange, because the investor just suddenly has the tokens, without any transfers at all.You found some interesting things but it doesn't prove he is specifically tied to anything shady going on.EOS has been using ICO funds to purchase later rounds of their own daily ICO, AND it's founded by a known scammer and serial ICO fund stealing douchebag. 

This isn't new.Jokes going to be on them when the government comes in and wants to tax the billion in revenue and they have to try to explain how they were just recycling money around and didn't really raise that much.Someone page Dan? Would be intresting to see his defense here. I don't know his username...IMO This is a poorly put together case. Also this was talked about ad nauseum at EOS' launch and well into their first month on these very boards. 
Overall yes what they are doing is potentially quite fraudulent. Their only saving Grace is #26 here: 
https://eos.io/faq.html

>26. Will block.one be contributing to the EOS Token distribution?
No, during the entire EOS Token distribution period, block.one will not do any of the following:
block.one will not purchase EOS Tokens by any means;
block.one will not pay any dividends to its shareholders; and
block.one will not perform any share buybacks.
block.one intends to engage an independent third party auditor who will release an independent audit report providing further assurances that block.one has not purchased EOS Tokens during the EOS Token distribution period or traded EOS Tokens (including using proceeds from the EOS Token distribution for these purposes). This report will be made available to the public on the eos.io website.

So I would say in the event that their audit is either not legit or poorly done then yes, Dan will be answering questions from the FBI. 
We still have months and months and months to go though till this thing is over and audited so.....Dan's response on telegram, which I found pretty sensible and open:

""The only crime that is occurring is libel of those making false accusations of fraud based only on unsubstantiated claims and their own disbelief in the range of possibilities.

All claims start with the individuals disbelief that block.one could generate this much legitimate revenue. There is no proof given to support that belief, instead it is based on their pre-existing bias toward believing EOS is a scam.

Then they make the logical fallacy ""if legitimate demand is impossible"" then ""they must be recycling funds"".  From this they generate the circular argument that EOS is a scam because they are recycling funds.  Therefore, ""because I believe EOS is a scam, I believe it is impossible for them to generate legitimate revenue; therefore, they must be recycling funds, therefore I have proven EOS to be a scam"".   Circular logic with no foundation.

block.one is owned by over 50+ people, it is a foreign corporation which means that US citizens own less than 50% (Brendan and I are US citizens), which means that any block.one owner contributing to the token sale would get a very small percentage returned assuming it was all dividend out. Only if 50+ people colluded to contribute exactly proportional to their stake would it balance out.   The game theory is biased toward individual shareholders not contributing (defecting); therefore, a collusion of 50+ people is a highly unlikely probability.""Good point about infinite token buying. If they have access to funds immediately that's definitely a vulnerability.

To make a _provably fair_ EOS-style crowdsale, collected funds **must** be locked until sale ends. Which is trivial to implement with Ethereum.

As for suspicious activity, that might be just arbitrage. If there was only natural demand for EOS tokens, sale price would be totally chaotic. But apparently some traders buy in the last hour of each period when they see that price is lower than on exchange. So you're in fact expected to see this kind of activity as there are wallets used just for flipping EOS.EO$ is a money printing machineCouldn’t these transactions just be arbitrage traders, getting EOS for slightly under market value and selling for a profit on exchanges?Please keep up the good work, as we most certainly need someone to keep an eye on things. BUT, Fair warning, be careful when posting about these kinds of things. False Accusations of Frauds or Scams is Criminal. Even if true, they can make your life miserable in court. Obv an Ethereum sub, but I’m going to guess this is more likely a case of arbitrage, selling on exchanges and buying through the ICO contract.  There are daily discrepancies and this is really just people taking advantage of this opportunity.

Obviously there is no way to know for certain, but calling Dan a scammer.  You have no proof.

He left BitShares, so what?!  He left Steemit after it was stabilized and saw an opportunity to put his skills to a better use through what he learned.  How’s that a crime or even a red flag?

This seems more like a bunch of bunch of FUD IMO.Where is the part where you provide evidence again? Your entire thread is a speculative conspiracy theory. I mean, if you're going to imply a project is laundering money citing random addresses as ""evidence"" doesn't cut it.

You've got no idea what the owners of those addresses are doing (or who they belong to.) It might be an automated process by an exchange. It might be a privacy-preserving scheme. It could be a trading strategy. You just don't know.

In light of the top comments here I wouldn't be surprised if this entire thread were a carefully designed scheme to short EOS by a bunch of greedy traders. I've seen similar tactics used now for other projects.

Honestly the fear, greed, and irrationality in this space makes it hard to be a part of at times.Of all these ICO's and we are to believe that there isn't a single one that isn't a covert criminal enterprise?  It seems that in an unregulated system, the opportunity for this behavior is amplified since the risk/reward ratio is significantly more agreeable.There's so much dodgy shit going on in the crypto market it boggles my mind. I heard about a group of guys, ""whales"" who have thousands of BTC each and they just ride and manipulate the BTC prices for profit. That and firms selling off things in principle, the list goes on. I guess this is the downside of an unregulated market. We all know that EOS is probably the biggest scam of our century. 

This investigation is really great and hope SEC or other regulators will look into it. 
You are smart.  Let's all create a billion new tokens, do ICOs, and make the same.  We can all get rich just like EOS creators.  Coins and ICOs create such easy money.  Why am I waiting time on Reddit when theres so much easy money waiting to be made?

0x0000 address has no key, by definition.  If you knew or could get the key for 0x then you'd have the key for every 0x on every ERC20 coin plus the key for ether 0x too.  Why don't you look in ETH 0x account or OMG or gnosis?  Weird transactions there too.  

Why don't you create your own ERC20 token, with your own 0x address and matching password?  It is impossible.  Try creating the address and password for 0x111... Or 0x12345...  You will find that even with your brand new ERC20 ico token of your choice, you can't create passwords or private keys first.  It's easy to create private key 0x000 or anything you want, but the matching public key is scrambled.  The other way around by creating your own public key first is impossible.  If it was possible, then you could choose any public key for any token or any ETH address and calculate the matching private key for it.  New ico token or old eth token all works the same.  

Crypto security 101.  Read some more Reddit and educate yourself.  Write some more Reddit and enjoy.  Thanks for your post.  Thought provoking. Address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is the address user has to send a contract to be created on ethereum. This is very basic stuff...Whoever is making those transactions might be doing them manually. The reason I say this is because at first glance the Ether values don't look fully random but there are also plenty of repeated ones. We should do an analysis on the distribution of Ether values. Also now that the cat is out of the bag, watch out for mixing.basically the same what ripple can do, bloat their amount of coins ad infinitum.https://www.chainalysis.com/#contactSomeone correct me if I'm wrong, but that kind of process if done with big enough sums, should drive up EOS price in it's ICO contract and push down price in the market. Because they are continiuosly buying EOS from contract and selling in the market. And arbitrators can only arbitrate in one direction here, because they can't sell EOS to ICO contract. So they can correct the price if it's lower in ICO contract than in the market, but not the other way around. In fact, those contracts could easily belong to arbitrators, because they would require that kind of fund movement to do their work.

I guess my point is: that kind of process should create a discrepancy between ICO price and market price, but we don't see that. So either there is no money laundering or it's small enough in scale.EOS tokens are not unlimited. What makes you say that?About the 0x0000... address: it is used as a sender in the AION token. It's just a way to mark tokens being created out of thin air.
A token contract is created with a limited supply of tokens or continues to mint tokens in time. In order to comply with the ERC20 EIP, it has to provide a ""from"" address everytime it makes a transfer. AION has solved this with 0x0000... (the address does not actually exist as in...it's not controlled by somebody)

+ it's also used to burn tokens. To mark burning, they emit a transfer even to this 0x000 address.

Just look at https://etherscan.io/token/0x4ceda7906a5ed2179785cd3a40a69ee8bc99c466?a=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000#readContractWhat's suspicious about traders that are arbitraging the ICO, selling EOS on exchanges if they think they can get it for less then they sell on exchange for?EOS must be a huge threat to ETH developers and loyalists. If it’s legitimate and succeeds, that would cause a lot of disruption.   I felt he was buying his own eos from the first month.  There is just no way people can dump that much money everyday especially with 2M tokens a day for a year that is just not possible.  If people actually bought that many tokens it would be one of the highest traded tokens on the market (top5).  I was an idiots for investing into this on the ico because I listened to other people shilling for matt.  

Now you took the time to look into it and glad you did.  Who is going to get the authorities involved?  Usually they are very lazy unless you do all the investigation and hand in the homework for them.

This is so stupid I had to write a response: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/76hiqp/negativity_towards_eos_dan_is_unwarranted_not/>Meaning if I owned the contract, I can continually send money and create more money out of thin air.

EOS can't 'print money'. They can of course create as many tokens as they want, and issue them to themselves, but those tokens only have value if others buy them. Buying from yourself isn't going to increase your net worth. What this could be is an attempt to create the illusion of demand, to encourage others to invest. But that's not the same thing as creating money out of thin air.[sure is a lot of active development work going on for all this to be a scam](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues)I hope these scumbags go to prisonShould i sell the Eos i have? I guess i went into this project without doing much research, was still new a bit to this, and have learned much since. What i'm wondering is how can the price of EOS go back up? I'll get past the pain of losing money if i have to sell now, but someone clearly has been buying it so i'm curious who's holding a lot of it and if this FUD spreads will people stop buying it? I've seen many people saying good things about the platform and it's only been a few months since it hit Kraken. While I don't have a lot in EOS, pulling out now rather than later when its worth 50% what it is now is a good thing to do but that's only if there's no real reasons to hodl. The whole structure of the ICO is really clever. They were able to buy in with 100% confidence in the first window knowing how they would continue to execute the scam while other investors had <100% confidence. Thid gave them supply and therefore price control.

My only hope is that a large fund like polychain got in on the initial ICO window and waited till the manufactured pump happened to sell all of their holdings, causing a loss to block.one. Anyone who bought into a later ICO window or on an exchange at a price higher than initial is playing into their game.https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip

just saying...is there anything we can do? will notifyting the CFPB get them to look into this?Not convinced at all. You have more efficient mean to launder your money. Actually you don't need to launder our crypto, all things considered.Perhaps the missing part of the puzzle that ties this all together is the Liqui.io hacks

People having their accounts hacked and portfolios changed for random tokens in particular EOS would mean they are not purchasing their own tokens directly but rather with stolen funds Surely they wouldn't be so obvious as to move the ETH they've received while the ICO is still going on... right? It's a public blockchain and that would scream fraudEOS gives a bad name to ICOs and Ethereum. Shame on them.

Stuff like EOS are what's gonna cause a bubble.What his name? The founderRe buying their own tokens to create a false sense of interest in the project. Isn't this misleading to investors?
LOL... you guys are crazy. I'm not invested in EOS, and not planning on investing, but this is straight FUD.

1. EOS is following a ICO model that Vitalik thought would be the best model. Please read Vitalik's ICO paper.
2. EOS parent company is out of Cayman Islands, SEC/FBI has no jurisdiction. 
3. Because the parent company is out of Cayman Islands, and Cayman Islands has no income tax on local companies, it would be entirely legal to do what you said they are doing. Who knows if they are.
4. Unlimited cap? WTF are talking about? I guess everybody that says 1 billion token cap must be lying. Including Coinmarketcap. Wasn't EOS the currency which had it source copied from another coin 1:1?Not surprised with this at all. Seemed fishy to me when I first heard about it.Reminds me of ethereum circa 2015Holly crap!  It all makes sense!   Biggest fraud scam in crypto!We all know the creator of ETH has been in the crypto world for a very long time and as such has a lot of BTC and all his other coins he has made during his time.

Let me lay out a scenario for you and you tell me what you think:

Start ETH with unlimited cap
Funnel existing cryptos into your own ETH
Get your funds back....since you own ETH
Get Tokens as well
Sell Tokens
Send BTC from tokens you just sold back to get more ETH tokens
Repeat at step 2.
This scheme can go on forever, or until the token your buying goes to 0.00. Yet ETH is currently $340. Meaning if I owned the contract, I can continually send money and create more money out of thin air.

ICOs are capped - not because its 'normal' but because it prevents fraud. If you don't cap the crowdsale, there is no prevention against fraud. Even with a capped crowdsale there is a chance of fraud, but its economically less viable the more you do it. ETH is unlimited in cap.

This is why other ICOs are not considered money laundering, there will be a point where your just buying your own tokens and its pointless. But if its uncapped, as long as the token has ANY market value (even .000001 cents) you can still make a profit doing this fraud. This is why ICO limit the amount of money they are bringing in, because if they did not set caps, there would be no way in knowing if the company bought all of their tokens themselves, or if it was a genuine firesale.No shit Sherlock! I hope everyone isn't figuring this out only now.I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
