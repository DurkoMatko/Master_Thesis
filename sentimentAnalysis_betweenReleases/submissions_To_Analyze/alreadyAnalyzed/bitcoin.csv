2010-11-18 06:04:09;BitCoin: a rube-goldberg machine for buying electricity;This sort of criticism doesn't make any sense to me. It's like criticizing an artist, or a carpenter, or a merchant because all that person really is is a Rube Goldberg device for consuming food.This is not how it works. BC works because it is a CONSTRAINED currency, that is, the govt. cannot reach up it's ass and pull a trillion of them out, like they did the late lamented US dollar.

2010-12-18 21:36:06;Do predicted advances in quantum computing put the viability of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin into question?;"In a word, no.

I should qualify the ""no"" with ""not anytime soon.""

At the moment, quantum computers are like arranging pins with a bulldoser.  So maybe there will be a time when high end quantum computers are available to the government and not the rest of society.  Of course, government needs private industry to make this happen any time soon.  So yes, there will probably be a point when the technology will destroy traditional encryption.

That's when the a quantum-crypto-currency will be needed.  Cubitcoin?Yes and no. I wouldn't use the bitcoin system to store large amounts of value, because of potential security holes that may or may not be related to quantum computing.

But I don't think it changes anything to the attractiveness of the system to handle small payments on the internet without relying on a single company such as paypal.No more so than advances in printing and  credit fraud  put traditional money at riskDo predicted advances in nanotechnology and molecular assembly put the viability of our materialistic and scarcity-based culture into question?"

2011-02-10 23:38:40;How to get started using your GPU to mine for Bitcoins on Windows;"m0mchil's miner is dead simple and works well. 

If you're hardcore, you can struggle with getting the right python packages installed locally so you can run it from source, which will allow you to tweak the source and try stuff (like bigger vectors in the openCL code. No, it doesn't really make things faster, but it's the kind of stuff you have to try once, I suppose.)

Now if there was a way to get the Flash Player to stop underclocking my GPU when an H264 video's playing, I wouldn't have to choose between making mad bitcoins or watching forgettable crap on Hulu.

2011-02-10 04:15:19;BitPenny: A mining pool that pays a fixed price per share;The website is pretty sparse on explanation and details.
2011-02-21 21:30:20;I installed Bitcoin... now what?;"My buddy said it best; you're not really making bitcoins, you're being compensated for helping with the encryption. well, for one, the bitcoin client only does CPU-based mining. If you have video card that is less than 3/4 years old, that's a few order of magnitude slower than what you'd get with a GPU miner.

Another neat side of GPU mining is that it leaves your CPU idle, and is designed to yield to other GPU-using stuff politely, so you can keep it running 24/7 while watching videos/gaming/whatever and not have to care too much. (some games may seem choppier under some conditions. you can always stop mining during your gaming session.)

if you check the forums on bitcoin.org, there should be a bunch of threads about GPU mining, including links to various miners you can download.

Miners run side-by-side with the bitcoin client (or in the case of a mining pool (like [Slush's pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/), standalone but chatting with the pooling server very regularly)

If nothing else, playing with GPU mining helped me realize the insane computing power my so-called video card contains (my oldish ATI 5770 can do a solid single-precision TeraFLOPS, which kinda blows my mind. In bitcoin terms, it computes 160 Mhash/s, where each hash consists of almost 2 full SHA-256 runs so that's over 300 million SHA-256/s. So that's kinda cool, and it keeps doing the regular video stuff while computing all that.)

As an aside, I'm still mining with my little 5770 as part of a pool. at the beginning of the year, I was getting 8 BTC a day. nowadays, it's closer to 3 BTC a day. My GPU consumes 280 Watts, running 24/7, that's ~ 6.7 kWh. My power company charges $0.052/kWh, so that means my 3 BTC/day cost about $0.35. At current rates, it's still worth doing. Hell, I just realized I'm basically mining enough BTCs to cover my entire electric bills so far.

So that's my little take on the whole ""mining ain't profitable"" concept. I'm really not doing it for the money, it's just something fun to waste GPU cycles on.
Nope....nothing you're really missing. You kinda missed the boat on the time in which a normal PC can generate any worthwhile coins. There was a time where it would only take minutes or hours for a normal quadcore PC, but now you would need to setup your PC as a miner for anything worthwhile.  

At this point, the easiest way for most people to get bitcoins is to buy them somehow, or figure something to trade for it. IMO, you've got three options.

* Join a pool
* Invest serious money into hardware
* Purchase a ""mining contract""
* Forget generating Bitcoin altogether

Joining a pool will decrease the variability of reward. Mining on your own, you'll get 50 BTC on average every ~4 years. If you join a pool, you will average out to the same 50 BTC over the same time period, but you get paid a small amount every time the pool finds a block.

If you want to purchase hardware to increase your generating capacity, cram a computer with as many Radeon 5970s as you can. Out of the box, you can probably install two per motherboard, maybe three. With some custom fiddling, you can get four working properly.

You could also purchase a contract from someone that has a large mining farm. This guarantees you a set hash rate for a set period of time, for a set amount of money. The only variables left are generation difficulty and exchange rate.

That said, I'd recommend the last option, forget about it altogether. The Bitcoin economy is growing, and that means increasing specialization. I don't think it will be too long before the only people left mining are doing so professionally. Keep in mind that the 50 BTC reward for finding a block is only temporary, and I think it's better described as a *subsidy*. Eventually, there will be no subsidy (halves every ~4 years), and the whole incentive to generate blocks will come from collecting transaction fees.

So, where does that leave you? With two options, as far as I am concerned. You can either exchange (some of) your existing money for BTCand/or you can offer goods or services in exchange for BTC.Mining is not profitable without huge GPUs. You will spend more on electricity than you ever hope to earn. Either install dedicated OpenCL/Cuda mining scripts or take bitcoin out of mining: it's just not worth it.

You need to either buy some currency somehow, or earn it through goods and services like real money."
2011-02-21 20:47:07;Game over scenario for Bitcoin?;"Out of all the Bitcoin Doomsday Scenarios (tm), this one is relatively mild.

Essentially it boils down to ""what if another currency captures our early adopter crowd's imagination.""

I think the real scary stuff starts when Bitcoin becomes successful. Successful enough to attract large number of the usual gambling and money laundering operations.

At that point, we'll start to see exactly how resilient Bitcoin is to organized attempts to shut it down by deep-pocketed entities.

Which reminds me, the *real* reason to mine is not to make a quick buck, but to increase the resiliency of Bitcoin to such attempts.The problem with that is... how would it operate differently? I mean, let's say there's a new currency that's capped at 21,000,000 and goes at the same ""speed"" as BTC, why would people opt to use that instead of BTC? There would be no benefits and BTC is already way ahead in that scenario.

Now let's say a new currency was made with a different cap and a different ""speed"", it wouldn't be much different from two commodities competing for each other.

Markets like MtGox, etc. would expand (may be) and adapt to the new virtual currencies. People can pick and choose as they please, but remember.. BTC is already doing this *today*. Which provides a pretty decent advantage.This is why we should not (yet) use bitcoins for storing all our money, but rather use them for business. If you don't hold too many bitcoins, you don't have much to lose from a crash. You don't need a lot of bitcoins to start doing business."

2011-03-01 18:03:18;"The Bitcoin market seems easy to ""game"" with GPU mining...why not adopt a better way to introduce currency?";"Only about 6 million of the total 21 million have been generated.

Given the current BTC to $, I would not recommend buying a full computer system for BTC mining, as it would take 6 months to a year to pay for the investment.  However, I would recommend upgrading your video card, as that would only take a month or two of mining to pay for a $250 investment.  Plus, you get cool graphics for your gaming.

The full potential of BTC has not yet been reached.  Depending on the acceptance, the final value of a BTC could be anywhere from $100 to $2.1 million.  If 21 million BTC were to replace 14 Trillion (the current U.S. money supply), each BTC would be worth $650K each.  So I believe the current exchange rate is still super low.This is really the only thing that concerns me with bitcoin. I love it overall, but it seems like you'll have a few ultrarich people who mined from the start. I'm guessing there are things to overcome this to a degree, but what?Well... I bought a new video card partially for mining. I spent a lot less than many people on the forums---$500 total on hardware---so turning a profit was pretty easy. And if I could do it again, I wouldn't have bothered. Had I just bought $500 worth of bitcoins at that time, I would have done far better. So mining may not be the free-money extravaganza you think it is.

At the same time, these ""rich"" became rich by contributing to a project that had little chance of succeeding even to the extent that it already has, and is far from finished with the ""not dying"" phase of its growth. From this perspective they're best looked at as VCs of a sort. They've taken an unlikely chance of making a huge profit, and so far it seems they've gotten lucky.

And you must admit that some of it is luck, or else it was obvious from the get-go that miners would make obscene profits... and then why weren't you doing it?"

As for the repaying of a loan argument: who the fuck takes out a loan in BTC? The only reason banking & loans work in USD is because they are federally backed. You can enforce a loan in a court of law. I doubt you can do that for bitcoin. 

Better argument against the loan problem: This happens in all currencies. If my USD drops in value during the 30 years it takes to pay off a mortgage, it's only an issue if i'm trying to repay my mortgage in a currency other than what I took out (or if i'm trying to sell my house for another currency)

2011-03-05 17:39:23;shouldn't bitcoin be using a DNS system?;"There's no reason why someone can't make their own bitcoin DNS.  It doesn't need to be built into the software though.  It would require a central authority so would be best left to competition outside of the bitcoin system.Actually, not having names is smart in a secure distributed system.  Check out [Zooko's Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko's_triangle) to understand why.I had the same reaction ( and the ""send to IP"" feature of bitcoin needs to die, imho. )

There are issues though.

For one, it requires the name-resolving service to be no less secure and no less trustworthy than the bitcoin system itself. Would DNSSec fit the bill? Who controls DNSSec anyhow?

For another, it's often very useful to be able to generate a different bitcoin address for different payers to use. For a business, it's pretty much the only know to tell one bill being paid from another with the same amount. Having to attach a static bitcoin address to bitcoin://buymystuff.com/ makes that impossible.

But that doesn't change the fact that bitcoin as it stands now is relatively unfriendly to use for non-geeks. If that doesn't improve before it reaches critical mass, it's going to provide a fertile ground for 3d parties like bitcoinmail.com and others to fill in the usability gap.
http://www.bitcoinmail.com/Couldn't you just use a text record with a bitcoin address in the existing DNS?Public bitcoin addresses are used only for donations. To receive payments from people (for example, for goods you sell) you should create an unique address for each individual payer. Otherwise it's a mess, for various reasons.

Implementing name system only to be used for donations doesn't make a lot of sense.

Same thing can be achieved through a browser plugin: a web site which accepts donations will add some additional meta-tag or link-rel to its HTML. Then plugin will notice it and will show a donation button. Look-ma, you can donate to any web page which is bitcoin-aware!
Sure, just code a secure, decentralized DNS system for it. I'm sure they'll throw it right in. "

GPUs are dramatically faster - on the order of 50 times faster - and for far far less than 50 times the power.

2011-03-05 01:07:29;Bit Coin Speculative jumps;"If you're not a speculator, it might be best to avoid holding onto large amounts of Bitcoin for the moment. As for dealing with fluctuating exchange rates, if you're selling from a web site, you can grab the current rate from MtGox (and other places) with a few lines of JavaScript.It is normal for a young currency to be more volatile. When there is few people in the market, one decission someone makes has more impact. As more and more people join the community and start using bitcoin, it becomes more stable. If you check the swings from the beggining they were way bigger than now. Bitcoin is slowly stabilizing.

That said, bitcoin is going to keep apreciating in dollar terms. The dollar is a inflationary currency, its in continuous devaluation. Bitcoin on the other hand is designed to be a strong currency,  and the continuous and big influx of new users makes the demand for bitcoin grow, pushing up its price. For different circumstances this will not change in the future, bitcoin will always appreciate in dollar terms (in the mid and long term).

As synthemescthewise suggested you can grab the current exchange rate from your preferred exchange services with a few lines of javascript. You can even design it so the price only changes with big changes of bitcoin/usd but ignores small swings.

And he/she? is correct also saying that you should only save in bitcoin if you are willing to accept the risk that any young currency has. I personally accept it, but its a personal decission.It depends on what you want out of Bitcoin. The exchange rate only matters until individuals can purchase the necessities of life with the currency, and businesses can purchase their raw materials.

If you want to help promote the Bitcoin economy even more, you could keep the proceeds from your sales denominated in Bitcoin. This would make you a speculator (which is a good thing, IMO), and you could purchase supplies with Bitcoin whenever possible.

If you merely want to use Bitcoin as a payment mechanism, you have a few options. You can accept BTC and manually exchange for USD whenever is convenient. You can set up an account at an exchange (like Mt Gox), and every time you accept payment, place a sell order on the exchange at the clearing price for that amount. You would have to keep a small balance of BTC on account while waiting for the payments to receive confirmations, but otherwise you would be converting all of your sales into USD.

Of course, you could also keep *some* of yours sales denominated in BTC, as a way to further manage risk.Note: US Dollar parity is always a speculative barrier. Until a new currency reaches parity, it hasn't reached parity yet. And once it's reached parity, people naturally don't want to pay a premium over parity.

In other words, US Dollar parity is pretty magnetic to speculation.I try to get around this problem by keeping all my transactions in bitcoin and if possible not exchange in or out. Although I am principally operating in the bitcoin economy when I'm spending anything online."

2011-03-09 00:11:47;Introducing WingCash: An e-currency with all the downsides of cash and credit but none of the advantages;"Did anybody else smell a faint odor of bullshit when the introductory video claimed there was no middle man in those transactions?

Sure, no middle man, except that the issuer of the currency (which you *must* trust when they tell you their currency is backed by the dollar, and not occasionally generated from thin air) is also apparently the only entity that can make transfers happen between two parties. What's a middle man again?

I'm a little confused by their business model, if there's one. They seem to be trying pretty hard to avoid being hit with the usual money laundering charges that seem to inevitably befall every successful virtual currency, but I don't really see where they get to make money legitimately.

Speaking of which, I enjoyed reading their [Terms of service](https://wingcash.com/terms). In particular, I recommend reading section 6 ""*Termination, Closing Your profile, or Limited Profile Access*"", and ponder what ""*We may terminate this Agreement and close your Profile for any reason at any time upon notice to you.*"" means to any wingcash ""notes"" you thought you ""owned"".

Beside these fun and interesting business aspects, I'd be curious to see any kind of technical paper explaining how the currency achieves its claims.

For example, is there a strong cryptographical mechanism that truly makes transactions irrevocable, or is the concept of ""wingcash irrevocability"" essentially just another business decision, enforced by wingcash.com's central position to every wingcash operation for exactly as long as they wish to enforce it? If the later, it's a rather weak form of irrevocability.

But hey, they're young and stuff, so maybe we should just chill and look at it again in 6 months and see if things look any better.

I'm storing an encrypted copy of my wallet in Dropbox to protect against this, but this relatively simple solution is still a too elaborate for old Aunt Tillie, who doesn't know where her wallet is stored and has never heard of GPG.

Eventually one of the following will probably happen:

1. People will have so much of their wealth in bitcoins that they will actually decide it's worth their while to learn data security. This is already happening to some extent, but given how people choose their online banking passwords right now, I wouldn't hold my breath.

2. People will keep most of their bitcoins in ""banks"" that make it their business to understand security. Not everyone, of course---some people won't trust banks, but they'll be making a conscious decision to take responsibility for their own security.

3. Improvements to the client software will make strong encryption and offsite backup dead simple.

If that file is destroyed, your bitcoin account still exists in the database, but there is no key to it, so you will have indeed lost access to it forever. The long term destruction of bitcoins would be more troublesome if it were a regular currency and not an infinitely divisible digital currency. The nominal number of bitcoins to some extent is arbitrary. While there are only 6 million bitcoins currently, we could also say there are 6 billion milli-bitcoins.Its gone forever, but the devs have thought of that.

Bitcoin can be spent in increments down to ~10^-9 or incredibly small values at todays prices.  Hence, if bitcoins are the worlds currency prices for burgers will be measured in mBTC (10^-3), uBTC (10^-6), or nBTC (10^-9).  I once saw some chatter on the boards going even smaller to pBTC and beyond.  

Bitcoins are finite, and can be easily destroyed, but split to near infinitesimal sizes.  

Currently miners do not verify transactions less than <.01 BTC, without a 0.01BTC transaction fee.  It is feared that trivial small transaction can be used to attack the database somehow.  mBTC, and uBTC transactions are just one boolean flag away if needed.  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet#Backup

Increased attention means increase in people looking into it and looking to buy coins, which drives up the rates faster than normal.

But mostly, I think it was the poker site shutdowns.  I would guess that there aren't any underlying fundamental reasons for the recent jump, but rather that this was the residual effect of the recent Bitcoin press, and a resulting increase in demand. For people that discovered Bitcoin via the EconTalk podcast, Forbes Magazine article, or the Time Magazine Online article, it would probably take at least a week to get get money into Mt. Gox from a US bank account given the post-receipt 7-day lag at the exchange, plus any additional delay of either setting up a verified ay pal account or transferring money to said account. The initial jump in the days after these news articles were released was probably due to speculation of this new money entering the market.Anyone have an idea of whether or not we should expect it to go down or should we just buy at the current price and accept we either invested too little, too late, or both.

Me, I'm on the gravy train-- woke up today and checked the numbers, AWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!


But I'll admit, I tell no one outside of the internet about BTC.Considering how ""cheap"" it is to mine bitcoins right now, this is definitely a bubble.  I just sold my stock and expect to rebuy somewhere in the %.60-$.80 cent range.I can't sell stuff to people with a currency this volatile. I sell someone a book and mail it to them, while they put the Bitcoins into an escrow service. If the Bitcoins double in value by the time they get their book, they'll just refuse to confirm the order.

Looking at the trade data over the last week, I noticed a lot of large purchases of 1000 coins or more. Snce you can't really use bit coin for much just yet, I would predict that someone is going to want to sell soon... Thus bringing down the price. 

That is, unless they know something I dont... Maybe poker sites are buying them.  If that is what is happening, then it's still going to go up![Forbes Magazine](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0509/technology-psilocybin-bitcoins-gavin-andresen-crypto-currency.html) has an article that goes out on May 9th.

2011-05-03 14:52:49;Discussing a decentralized scaling solution to the double spending problem (and bitcoin scalability again);"I've been thinking about this for months.  The best solution I have is to allow the main block chain to delegate coins to branch block chains.  The branch block chain would work the same was as the main block chain, except that it would not generate new coins, those working on the branch block chain would only get coins by transaction fees.  The number of transactions in the main block chain will be limited to keep the size manageable.

The interface would have to change so that bitcoin only downloads the branch or branches you specify.  Further, branches would be broken down into ""trading regions"", where trades are more likely to happen within those regions.

By doing this, everyone will have the main block chain and one or two branches where their coins would be stored and where their transactions would likely happen, and the number of transactions per branch and trunk could be manageable.

The only drawback I see to this method is when coins traverse back to the main block chain.  Since not everyone has all the branches, a block on the main block chain showing coins coming from a branch could be attacked in such a way as to confuse those not having the appropriate branches, and the ones working on the main block chains would have to load up the branch chains to see which IP's were attempting to fake a transaction.  (Basically, the main chain block miners would hate this solution.)

It is difficult to describe what I'm thinking about.  Please ask questions, and I'll fill in what I've considered.Currently, network generates around 7200 bitcons per day, that is $20000 per day. This fees (and they will be greater in the future) are paying for scalability problem without resorting to central authority.What if it worked on a partial assumption of the current number of blocks/transactions? More simply put - a computed hash of the hashes to make sure it checks out, instead of going through each block one by one to make the chain.> Adding an user will require M message to that user (to notify him of all previous transactions), which is exacly the ""block chain download"" you perform when you start a new client, an operation that is very long already btw)

That part really doesn't need to be as long as it is. The whole reason behind the [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree) chosen to store the block chain is its ability to trim older transactions without impeding the ability to verify the validity of the chain.

As for the rest, the 1M user x 1 M transaction is 1T message, sure, but how many message will each user actually see? 1M. How many messages will at most be sent over a particular user's pipe? 1M * (1+bitcoin neighbors). For me right now, that'd be *9. Okay. Note that the bandwidth I consume on my side is only correlated to the number of transactions happening, not to the total number of users on the network.

So that doesn't sound quite as scary as your final verdict of unscalability, mostly because the load is fairly well distributed over the entire network.

Now to go back to your 1T figure, yes, that's about the total amount of data that the internet would need to carry as a whole. You could argue that ISPs might start to get nervous if this gets very popular. Or maybe it wouldn't even register as a blip compared to the large quantity of video-on-demand otherwise clogging the pipes. 
My point is, how sure are you that the available bandwidth is not [growing fast enough](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html) to accommodate bitcoin's growth and then some?> i think the main weakness of bitcoin is it's lack of scalability

There is no scalability problem. As the number of transactions increases, so too does the financial reward for solving a block.

Once blocks get sufficiently large, most desktop clients will begin to use the simplified payment verification method, instead of verifying the full block chain. The task of verifying the block chain would fall to supernodes.

> Solutions with supernodes should explain how supernodes are harmless

There is no difference between a normal client in the bitcoin network today, and a supernode in a theoretically much larger bitcoin network.

It's important to realise that there wouldn't just be a handful of supernodes; there'd be hundreds of thousands. Transaction fees would ensure that anyone with sufficient hardware and bandwidth could turn a profit by running a supernode.

Theoretically, the network could be compromised if an attacker had access to over 50% of the supernodes, but the larger the bitcoin economy, the more money would be required to do that. By the time the bitcoin network has to handle 20ktps (assuming that ever happens), the economy will be so large that it would be extremely difficult for any one entity to find enough computing power to compromise the network. It would be even more difficult for an attacker to hide the fact that they control the majority of the bitcoin network.

In short, scalability isn't really an issue."

2011-05-10 18:03:05;I am new to this and have a few questions...;"First, some basics. A hash is produced by taking the block header and a nonce, and hashing those values together in a specific way. A winning hash is one that is below the target, a small number starting with a lot of zeroes. The target is inversely proportional to the difficulty. A share is a ""winning hash"" for the lowest difficulty, one. Pools use shares as mini proofs of work.

There are a few different models of pool payments.

**Pay per share**
You get a fixed payment for each share you generate. This payment is calculated to give the pool operator some profit, from what I've seen in the 5-10% range. This method is the riskiest for pool operators, and least risky for pool users.

**Direct shares**
Once a block is found, your payout is equal to... (your shares / total number of shares * 50) - pool operator fee. The risk pretty fairly balanced between operator and users.

**Score system**
Similar to direct shares, except that newer shares are ""worth"" more than older shares. This protects the operator and users from attempts of others to gain an advantage by hopping between pools."
2011-05-10 15:52:04;Why would you spend your bitcoins to buy things instead of spending your dollars?;"Simple, just buy some more bitcoins when you use your bitcoins for something. I have this situation, since I want to use bitcoins to support bitcoin entrepreneurs (probably will buy some bitcoin hosting & domains for my projects), while I still believe in bitcoin value in long-term. I'm sure in addition of spending bitcoins I will be hoarding them too.There's no guarantee that the exchange rate will continue to rise. I think it probably will, but I'm still willing to spend some of the coins I bought at $0.60 when they're valued at $4.00.Anonymity, for one. I'm surprised BitCoin hasn't exploded in the black market.Well, you'd certainly spend bitcoins if they were the only or the easiest way to get something you wanted. This isn't often the case right now, but eventually it could be the case somewhere (Silk Road seems like a likely candidate in this regard).

And you'd probably spend them if you thought the current market valuation was about right. Most people would agree that the long-term probability of success for bitcoin is slim at best---let's say 0.5%. Most people would also agree that, if Bitcoin were widely adopted, one bitcoin would easily be worth $1000. If you believe both of these things, you should be willing to sell a bitcoin for $5 or more right now, or trade it for goods/services if you would spend $5 on them.

And you just might spend them if you were low on cash. As a result of the rising exchange rate, I now have more of my assets in bitcoins than in cash. If I suddenly had to drop a lot of money on something, I might use credit, but I hate taking on debt if I can help it---I've been burned once already. Once the bill came in I might just dip into my bitcoins.>[Gresham's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law)

>It is commonly stated as: ""Bad money drives out good"", but is more accurately stated: ""Bad money drives out good if their exchange rate is set by law.""


TL;DR; People buy bitcoins, see the dollar plummeting, and spend FRNs instead while the last.Good question. Economically it makes sense either if there is some advantage in paying with bitcoins (e.g. lower fees, anonymity etc.) OR you expect bitcoins to depreciate (they cannot appreciate forever).> Bitcoins appreciate and dollars depreciate

If this is true, then bitcoin is dead as a currency. Stick a fork in it.

A currency no one uses is a useless currency.If there isn't a market using BitCoins why would you want them? If nobody buys things with them the market will probably collapse because they will likely become worthless through lack of organic demand.If you are getting your pay in bitcoins, than you should convert them to dollars for that."

2011-05-17 22:49:04;Cost of Mining?;"You can always figure it out experimentally. 
http://bitcoin.atspace.com/income.html

     {$btcgenerated} * {$rate} = {$currencyGenerated} //usually usd
     {$dailyPowerConsumptionRate} * {$costPerKwh} = {$powerCost}
     {$currencyGenerated} - {$powerCost} = {$profit}

It will vary depending on your computers power consumption and how much you are charged per kW/h. You have to calculate your block generation, then look at the daily market value to determine your estimated output in USD. Then you need to measure your power consumption in kW/h and figure out the price you'll be paying per kW/h. You can then compare the cost of running the machine to the estimated output. Don't forget to take into consideration the fluctuation of the market, rising difficulty of block generation, and the demand for Bitcoin, then decide if it is worthy of your investment.

Short answer: No.If you've already got an ATI Radeon 5850 or better, I would say it is worthwhile to join a mining pool. If you're looking to buy hardware as your first bitcoin investment, don't bother - it's probably more efficient to buy coins instead. If you're talking about CPU mining, don't bother - it will probably cost more to run than it makes.Define ""cost"". Will you be buying new parts that you expect to recoup the costs of? Or will you simply be factoring in the cost of energy consumption?

If you buy a whole new computer at this point just for mining, then you will probably not break even. If you just buy a new GPU, then you may, depending on the price and its efficiency. If you are just planning to run on the hardware you own, and it can mine at least 50-100 MH/s, then absolutely."
2011-05-17 22:17:45;Completely New To Bitcoin;"Nope.

Don't bother hashing on your CPU, it is orders of magnitude slower than your video card. Make sure you've got ATI Catalyst installed (forgot what version) and that you selected the option something like ""Cypress"" in the Device drop down.

You should be getting somewhere around 300-350 Mhash/sec. If you still have issues, take a screenshot of your miner config, or paste the results of the console here.you should be getting 300-400 with that card. make sure you're using the openCL miner and not the CPU one. use file / new openCL miner to start it if you aren't.Also if you upgrade to the latest poclbm miner and run it with -f0 -w128 you can get closer to 375Mhash/s."
2011-05-17 22:10:06;beginner question;"Well, if you have a talent or skill that translates to the internet, you could offer that in exchange for payment in bitcoin. For instance, there's a guy named Shazow that does cool drawings and has made a decent amount that way.

If you have a decent video card, especially an ATI 5850 or above, you can contribute to the security of the network and in return get paid bitcoins.

Oh, there's also the [faucet](http://freebitcoins.appspot.com), which (when it's not down) will give you 0.02 BTC. [Witcoin](http://witcoin.com/) is like reddit, except you have to pay to post/comment/vote, but you get paid when someone replies or upvotes you.

edit... There's [The Bidding Pond](http://www.biddingpond.com/), an auction site with payments in bitcoin. You can open a free [Fedex account](http://fedex.com/us/oadr/index.html) and get an 8-16% discount on shipping, if you want to sell things that way.Offer services. Bitcoin has no child labor laws or minimum wage, so your labor will be easier to sell.You can get a small, fractional amount from http://freebitcoins.appspot.com/ for free. You can try GPU mining in a pool, but unless you have powerful hardware, you probably won't make much there.If you already have a ATI GPU you can start running a GPU miner and join a pool for some coins. Nvidia cards don't mine as well. 

I've been mining on a ATI4850 for about a week and got 5.36 coins (*$7.20USD=$38.59). It's a start.

And MtGox price gos up .50 in the half-hour since it aired.I don't think ""volatile asset"" is really fair. While volatility technically just means dispersion of an asset's value and not whether the dispersion is positive or negative, the risks associated with volatility are largely associated with dispersion in both directions (a wobbling price). With bitcoin, we are disincentivized from spending, but not because dispersion makes it hard to value. It is the perceived predictable rise in value of btc that makes us want to hang on to them and impairs btc commerce at the moment.

Would anyone call Google stock up to '07 a volatile asset? Then we shouldn't use that term for btc either.SO FUCKING EXCITED!"

Right now mining might be profitable, at least to break-even, if you can get a good card at run it 24/7 somewhere that electricity isn't too expensive. The difficulty is shooting up, but the BTC/$ rate has also shot up over the same time.

I've heard that all Radeon cards beyond about the 5830 are out of stock everywhere. 6990s were gone two weeks ago. 6970s followed a few days later, and on down the power curve.Take a math class? I don't know...

Giving out financial suggestions/tips is generally illegal in most first world countries.

Good luck.Some off-the-cuff math (the calculator does all this for you):

3x 5870 @ 350 MHash/s each, consuming ~ 200 W each = 1000 MHash/s, 600 W total GPU consumption. Host system (mobo, CPU, hard drive, ram, fans) consuming ~150 W. 750W total, 80% power efficiency plus a bit is about 1000 W.

1 kWH = $0.30, 1 kWD = $8.00. deepbit.net estimates 1000 MHash/s @ 1.6 BTC/day. BTC exchange rate = $18 USD. 1.6 * $18 - $8 = $20 daily operating profit"

And you will get fired, eventually.Bad plan.  Mostly because of cpu mining.  If you want to scam your company id say take your work computer (assuming you have one) and put a graphics card in it. You will make more than 30 machines cpu mining (card dependent of course), minimal cost, and the electricity use of 1 machine  will probably go unnoticed.

2011-06-21 22:27:00;Let's talk a bit about password security.;"KeePassX is the one I'm using now. It is open source and works on all platforms and will sync computers together with the right addon.Then you have to remember the password safe password which had better be pretty damn long> Let's talk a bit about password security

Step 1: Don't give away the hash fileyea, um, how about we not use passwords at all? How about instead, when you sign up for an account, you send them your public PGP key. When the site wants to authenticate you, it posts a random challenge string. You sign the string with your private key and post the signed challenge back. Then the site verifies your PGP signature against the public key you signed up with. Voila! You just signed in with no stored passwords or sensitive/reusable secrets and just strong crypto. Shit, you dont even need to provide a username because your account can be identified by its public key id.I have just started using [Pocket](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.citc.wallet), its an android ap with a windows version, it syncs all your devices via dropbox. great for being able to access your passwords from your andriod phone and your PC.

have not heard any bad news about it yet...I thought I was pretty cool for using SuperGenPass YEARS ago...1Password is pretty nice.  It lets you 1-click login from within the vault.Lastpass.com is really great, and supports a lot! As to password techniques, read this: https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm  Read the whole page! And use the tool!I've been using [pwsafe](http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe/) a lot lately, and I think it's really excellent.  Its password database is apparently compatible with Password Safe, but I haven't had the need to try that yet.  There are packages for debian/ubuntu, and I'm sure most other distros.

If you're a linux/command-line type, you should look into this.You don't necessarily need 16 characters if you use really random strings like ""TjWr~BmL6x!Q"" or something. And actually bitcoin addresses make good sources of random characters. Just don't use a portion of an actual bitcoin address, especially not your own :)Good idea.

I recently read that the most secure passwords, and the easiest to remember... are those that consist of multiple simple english words *that are separated by spaces*.

A password such as:

**i love protecting my bitcoin wallet**

would be *much* stronger than:

**s&3H92%TL9**

2011-06-21 22:14:44;Virtual Currency Bitcoin Rises in Usage, Value From Bloomberg;Wow. CNBC and Bloomberg coverage could send interest in BTC through the roof. It's a tragedy that the only liquid exchange for the stuff is down indefinitely at the time of this coverage.
2011-06-21 21:24:38;I'll just leave this here....;"If my understanding of the negative balances thing is right, the people who have negative balances are the people whose buys (at Ã¼ber-low prices) couldn't be reverted because they successfully withdrew the funds before MT closed down the exchange - so they're actually the only winners here. MT will effectively need to pay their negative balances off out of his own funds if Mt Gox is to be solvent. I think the biggest potential danger we face now is that the total negative balance is more than MT can pay.

Edit: stupid apostropheThere is simply no way anyone would keep 500,000 bitcoins on MtGox.

What most people don't realize is that MtGox takes your bitcoins, that is to say they reside in MtGox's coffers, and in exchange, they make a little entry into their database with a number you get to play around with, which is solely a representation of the bitcoins you sent them.  When you make a trade they ""front you"" the bitcoins to make the trade and move bitcoins from your database entry, to the person you made the trade with.  Only when you want to withdraw or move bitcoins, do any bitcoins actually get released.

So that said, there is NO FUCKING WAY someone would have 500,000 bitcoins on an unproven exchange.  As we saw, 500k constitutes more liquidity than the entirety of the exchange, so what's the fucking point of having them there?  You would have to be consuming paint chips by the handful to make that decision.

There are only a handful of ways it's possible for a single account to have that many:

1. MtGox's transaction fee balance was in one account, and had way more money than anyone thought.

2. Some Godlike trader was able to acquire it via very successful string of MtGox trades for a whole lot more than the total liquid volume of all trades on the exchange.

3. A hacker was able to write their own account balance in MtGox's database, and MtGox is covering up such a blatant hole in their security.

I would also issue a warning.  MtGox's incentive to not run off with all of your bitcoins is only dependent on two factors, their ability to make more money being legit, and their ability to sell all of those coins on some other exchange.  It would be wise not to forget those two things with regards to any bitcoin exchange.>A bank gets robbed by a band, and they forget one of the bags full of money while running away. Why would anyone think taking it is legal?

2011-06-28 23:42:40;Can Bitcoin survive?  Is It legal?;"Another ignorant Forbes Online article about bitcoin that reads more like an op ed with mistruths and little to no facts. Atleast Forbes magazine in print has higher standards then to print this dribble or I would be canceling my subscription.I like how they completely left out that bitcoins are being traded at $17.99 USD right now.Might just be me, but the article seemed to meander a bit.

> [...] there have been many attempts at creating online currencies â including Digicash, Flooz, and Beenz. But they never caught on because their marginal costs to consumers and merchants exceeded their marginal benefits. Simply put, there was no compelling reason for the key participants to adopt these new currencies.

This was a good point. Bitcoin can't just be a substitute for an existing currency; it has to fill a niche that hasn't been filled yet. It has to transform the public's expectations of money.

> Bitcoin might survive as a currency if it can find a way to make consumers and merchants better off. But its limited use so far suggests that the most compelling application â as a way to pay anonymously for illegal drugs sold on Silk Road â is the one that has been referred to the U.S. Attorney General as a violation of money laundering statutes.

Buying drugs online is a sensational story. Unfortunately, that means most people will only hear about that one use case for Bitcoin.

> But unless it can find a way to get consumers and merchants to adopt it, Bitcoin is more likely to go the way of Flooz (bankrupt in August 2001) than to challenge the dollar as a means of payment.

This was an odd conclusion, given the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Unlike the other examples of online currency, Bitcoin isn't dependent on an organization that can go bankrupt. It can survive without being mainstream successful, and it can go a long time without posing a serious challenge to other currencies: there are no impatient venture capitalists to pull the plug.That was written today and doesn't mention the fact that bitcoin's value bounced back and hit $17 again? If Bitcoin is illegal, then so are poker chips, Second Life spacebux, whatever the hell Entropia players use, Eve Online ISK, and possibly even World of Warcraft gold.If a reader already knows a little about Bitcoin, that article is enough to convince them that Bitcoin is superior to Digicash, Flooz, Beenz, gold, credit cards, and Paypal. And the double spending problem has been solved.

By the way, has anyone used [bitbills](http://bitbills.com/)? To me, the biggest flaw with those is that to access the bitcoins you have to destroy the card; it's not reloadable. And you also have to use a QR code scanner and then [importprivkey](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3906.0), fairly technical stuff. And the guy selling them is making a killing. There is one [guy](https://www.bitcoin2cc.com/) accepting bitcoin for virtual VISA cards (card number, expiration date, etc), and he's also making a killing. Like $29.70, $24.55, or $21.15 profit each. Or $6.83, $9.74, or $14.71 CAD profit each.Some potential problems with bitcoin I see is the neverending blockchain, the problem of passwords, theft, and irreversible transactions. Oh, and also malicious forked blockchains and clients. Also, [one guy](http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/06/21/against-the-gold-standard/) says the bitcoin network can only handle a maximum of 6,000 transactions an hour. Is that true?

Is it legal? Well, bit torrent is still around, and so are Linden Dollars. Although I could see exchanges being taken down for money laundering. Especially when there are services called [Bitcoin Laundry](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Laundry) and BitLaunder.

I have [read](http://dailyreckoning.com/the-war-on-digital-currency/) that bitcoin ""poses a direct â though entirely non-violent â threat to the stateâs monopoly on counterfeiting.""

And [also](http://rulingclass.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/bitcoin-and-agorism/) read ""It should be realized that if the State, particularly one that has âoligarchicalized money and credit,â particularly one whose currency serves as the global reserve, lost itâs monopoly on money, it would likely collapse. So, itâs a bit naive to think that the State would comply with such an outcome.""if it becomes illegal that won't stop me from using it. Just another example of how corrupt the system is and how much it needs to collapse and die."

2011-06-28 20:42:22;How do you feel when you read comments like this?;"A little angry to be honest, what he says is demonstrably false:

* There is currently no (legal) risk whatsoever for a merchant. Bitcoins are not currently illegal, and even if they are made illegal in the future, you can't be prosecuted for acts that weren't illegal at the time you did them.
* The financial risk for merchants is almost nil if they immediately convert their Bitcoins to local currency (and of course declare that income on their taxes properly). There's no gambling involved.
* Calling Bitcoin a ponzi scheme is just ignorance of the definition of a ponzi scheme. No one is guaranteeing people who invest in Bitcoin a payout of any kind (in fact most people are warning potential investors that they could lose everything they invest).

It's just rhetoric, and unfortunately very compelling rhetoric for anyone who doesn't know the facts.Skepticism is good. I'm more upset at people who blindly shout ""TROLL"" whenever anyone shows some skepticism or points out some downfalls

>It's very risky of legitimate business owners to accept bitcoin payments

Depends what they do with the bitcoins once they have them

>if the purpose of using them is money laundering, tax evasion, or the purchase of illegal goods, there are criminal concerns.

True

>Bitcoin in particular has had some serious problems.

Wallets being semi easily stolen could be considered a serious problem especially if you were a business owner . Bitcoin being used more as an investment than a currency is also a problem imo.

>At this point, it's like gambling at best, Ponzi scheme at worst.'

Gambling yes if you are investing in hopes of a profit. If it's a Ponzi scheme then FOREX is also one.I feel that it's their loss and not bitcoin's. Why? because when they do realize what it is, they will get involved anyways. It's just now or later. It is a risk.  The value is not stable, there are major trust issues with the exchanges, and there are several legal hurdles on the horizon.

It is a gamble, but so are all investments.

If you call Bitcoin a ponzi scheme, you are just telling everyone that you are ignorant of how bitcoin works.Nice try, Ben.this is so BS-laden its obviously made to discredit Bitcoin. I don't think anyone can take this seriously.

Besides, the main reason not to take Bitcoin at the moment is that for many practical uses it is too hard to setup. But this is changing as we speak. "

""The 100 most powerful Supercomputers in the world all combined are only as powerful as 25.98% of the Bitcoin Network, at doing Bitcoin operations.""

The supercomputers would beat the pants off of the Bitcoin network at many other sorts of operations, including floating point operations and all sorts of highly connected simulations that need massive amounts of data transfer between computational nodes.  In some sense the Bitcoin network can't even be compared to a supercomputer because every individual hash is a completely separate event, whereas a supercomputer can handle massively intertwined calculations, such as a physical simulation of weather, or a nuclear bomb going off, or particle interactions.

The supercomputers are very generalized and highly connected.  The Bitcoin network is much more specific (it's composed nearly 100% of GPUs, which aren't good for computations that involve branching), and it's very spread out.  You couldn't do anything that was very data-intensive with the Bitcoin network; Internet transfer speeds and latencies don't come close to cutting it.I suppose someone should explain why this is relevant.

If an entity was to attack the Bitcoin network, its greatest vulnerability would be for someone to gain a majority share of the network's processing capability, which would allow that entity to alter the network in such a way as to create chaos by reversing transactions and double spending coins.

Obviously this means that if a government wished to attack the network in order to destroy it, they would have to cough up some serious computing power beyond the capabilities of even the mightiest super computers in order to accomplish this feat.>...that we know of.

Should be how your title ends ;)And all that enormous computing power is spent on what, exactly?

Too bad the folding@home project that let you help with medical research never attracted as much attention... how many Flops are one Hash ?  The Bitcoin Network has currently 12 THash/sWant a super computer? buy bitcoins and offer them to people in return for their computer power...

2011-07-12 20:31:09;Anybody know what happened to the Mods Blitzboom, edzillion, noagendamarket and hubbabubbahobo?;"I'm still around.   

I'd been having a back and forth with a new user, BobbyLarken, about a link to an Ayn Rand tract he was trying to post. It wasn't related to Bitcoin and well, it was Ayn Rand and so pretty painful for non-Rand fans to read. Anyway, every time he submitted it, it would get stuck in the spam queue and the user would mail the mods asking why we were assisting the state in the subjugation of free-thinkers like him and Ayn. I explained, repeatedly, that it was the spam filter that was impeding his relentless fight against tyranny but I wasn't prepared to pull an Ayn Rand tract out of the spam pile regardless of the lessons he believed were contained therein.  

I suggested he come back with a self post outlining *his* philosophical reasons for using Bitcoin. He did and although I didn't agree with any of it, it was well thought out and I could see how it could possibly generate some worthwhile discussion so I pulled it out of the spam queue since the spam filter had learnt to just gobble everything he submitted by that stage.  

I actually thought his self post would pose more of a threat to my position than the Rand novel excerpt. I wasn't picking weak opponents to let through in case anybody suspects that. Anyway, I guess he really wanted the Rand stuff in here because I'm thinking he got in touch with Atlas and whined as only a Randian Ãbermensch would. Well, Atlas Shrugged, went all John Galt on the other mods and brought in Jake (love what you did to the place by the way mate!).  

Meh. I'll be interested to see how things turn out. Atlas might be right that the users here will downvote crap into oblivion making moderators almost redundant. I thought it was amusing that that was exactly what happened with his self post announcing this brave new, non-coercive approach to an internet community.   

However, I think the Broken Windows Theory is a big determiner. The typical user won't clean up a shithole but they won't shit in a a nice clean room either. If active mods keep people to a set of standards, a community looks completely different to one where it's a free for all. Different and objectively better. Yes, I'm an anarchist all in favour of an oligarchy here on Reddit. A life of work and travel changes and nuances some of your views over time. Big systems like a national community and small ones like a family or an internet forum don't have the same optimal organisational structures. The difference between the real world and the internet is that it's easy to move between net communities but hard to find a good one and the reverse with the real world.  

We'll find out for sure who was right. I never banned or deleted stuff because it attacked my views. If anything, I promoted stuff I didn't believe in but thought made good fodder for discussion and I nixed plenty of bile about Mt.Gox although I despise it. But Atlas is a slimy young guy who already has a track record of clumsily concocted schemes to make money in scammy ways. The Bitcoin address in the sidebar over on the right there just appeared one day without explanation. He tried to just slip it in past the other mods without any discussion and it remained there until I started a thread about it. He put it there originally the way people might put one of their own addresses in a forum sig and as a forum moderator with colleagues, he saw no difference to that. A weaker, less creative individual like myself would have pulled the address and slunk away in shame but Atlas held to his selfish principles and the address's raison d'Ãªtre became donations for ads shilling Bitcoin to the masses. Do a search through his posts and you'll find some of his ideas for these TV ads. They are awesome.  

There's been other stupid stuff too. He and a buddy were running a podcast and they put a browser miner on the site without telling people but I don't think Atlas ever really understood the problems with his integrity this sort of thing highlights. He's going places no doubt about it. The problem is that he's going to get into enough trouble eventually and his parents won't be able or willing to help him out which marks the end for most Ayn Rand fans' belief in their own superiority and irrepressible will to suceed.  

This place could get better, worse or stay the same. I don't think the latter is likely but I don't know which of the first two will come true. The anarchist in me likes to think it will be a blossoming of the potential of the people. Or it could become the forum at bitcoin.org with Atlas trying to get the occasional little scam through. If that happens, the community here will get forked and we'll start again. Like I said, it's easy to move between virtual communities but good ones require active moderation because social pressure doesn't have the same leverage it does in the offline world.It probably has to do with the recent posts by AtlasLGo regarding censorship of submissions/content to this subreddit.  Perhaps not all mods agreed on the free-for-all approach.  jakemates did the recent CSS skinning, so he was probably added for access to the CSS editing functions.Was too many mods for such a smaller subreddit anyways, not everyone could possibly agree with one way to run things.Thank God hubbabubbahobo is not a mod anymore.

Kinda like how ""Kleenex"" became a generic term for tissue paper? 

I don't like the idea of some person owning the trademark.  Unlike Linux, which was really developed by one person, the value of bitcoin is that it's owned by *no one*.  Having someone own a trademark gives them control. Go to one lawyer, then get a BTC pool going.  Convert to $, pay lawyer, block trademark.  Isn't this pretty simple?  It may cost a lot, but probably not to each donor individually.  This guy is an idiot.  His ""brilliant"" idea is going to get him killed.  One thing you don't screw with is peoples money.

2011-07-19 22:18:21;Do the users of Bitcoin tend to follow Libertarian/Voluntarism type views?;"Though some of the benefits of Bitcoin are very compatible with the libertarian ideals, a lot of libertarians seem to feel that ""gold is money, nothing else"" and dismiss Bitcoin because it is not shiny and yellow - the attributes which apparently impart ""innate value"".The first users of Bitcoin were nearly all libertarians or anarcho-capitalists. Satoshi himself said:
>Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.
>
>Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.I don't trust our ""elected"" political ""experts"" who ""balance"" our financial systems as much as I trust mathematics. most bitcoin users are libertarianish, you will see that on every forum.  It just makes sense, given that bitcoin's economic foundation is compatible with Austrian EconomicsI think that many users do have that particular political bent. However, I think there are also many people who aren't strictly libertarians and use bitcoin because they think they can make money as investors or traders or because they are interested in the technical aspects. My guess is that people in these latter categories are more likely to have more traditional political views (e.g., democrat or republican). On the bitcoin forums, it certainly feels like most of the posters are libertarians / anarchists, but that's probably not a representative sample. That's probably true, and I count myself in the camp of folks who like the idea of a money system that governments can't control.

On the other hand, I think it has huge potential for micro transactions. With tiny/no fees, the ability to ask someone to pay a small sum for an audio file, digital comic, or some such with instant confirmation* is pretty awesome.

I just posted a separate thread on it.Just needs more people.. Starting to look like a scam... I was in 1st for the majority of the tourney then all of the sudden the screen just goes blank. I try to log back in and now I keep getting this: Connection failed
Click Back Button to retry. Is this just me or is anyone else not able to log in? This isn't the first time the screen has randomly disappeared and every time it happens I'm almost been all in when I bet then time runs out because I can't see shit so I automatically fold. It happened 5 times last night causing me to loose 2 bitcoins worth of chips, I don't like to jump to conclusions but I'm starting to feel like one of those old people that realized they were a victim to identity theft only to be left out in the cold unable to buy that new hip transplant. If it is a scam, bravo you pulled that fucker off really smooth but I hope you get hit by a bus.I'm on there, and I can vouch for it being a good site to play.

Since asicminer.net isn't... I would like to at least know the name, address and phone number of SOMEBODY I can harass if/when it turns out to be a scam.[deleted]Well given that one person on the forum spammed this url in like 4 threads, I'm not really convinced it's true.

I would love to buy some asci devices, I know it doesn't cost that much to make them, assuming the company is real, they are going to make some right profit from people at those prices.I guarantee to pay nothing into this scheme like a filthy leech, wait until your confirmation that one or both of these operations are legitimate, and use that information to inform my own purchase of the equipment.I'm curious about this. What do you plan to do about electricity costs?[deleted]I'd be willing to invest 5 BTC once I see some performance data.I'm down for $100 in btc.  (whatever the exchange rate is at the time we decide to go in.)   

And we all want proof, as much as we can get in this situation.What assembly/setup is required?  Would we get the specs/code?http://asicminer.net/?p=58#comment-33So you're creating a financial security. I hope you've talked this over with a lawyer who's familiar with SEC regulations.

I wish that wasn't necessary, and maybe the feds would overlook you, but technically, this could get you in trouble if you're not careful.I was a bit late to the asicminer thread. And looks I'm late to this one but asic miner, at current BTC prices is a good way to turn 250BTC into 200. 

If you assume 12 day difficulty adjustments (with no 8-10 periods at all, they make it much worse) you'd end up barely eeking out 200BTC. 

This device will only produce more BTC (total ever) than just buying them if BTC starts rapidly loosing popularity.

The ASIC miner might be a cheeper way to get into mining at the moment, but purchasing one of these is simply irrational compared to buying BTC.

If someone disagrees with my math, please point it out to me. If I'm wrong I'd really like to know. (Wouldn't be my first time, see my comment history, I am wrong often).

 I hope to get something up showing my actual math on this soon.I'd be in for some amount if it were to ever pan out.neat idea...  too bad it's scaryI'm interested - I'll invest $10-$50 depending on what ASICMiner's response is.. Hopefully it happens but I don't have much hope :o/you have a $100 investment (worth of btc) from me, but only when asicminer release an image (or some other form of proof), and I see that ebay account (and know that you own it)

Also I ask the same question about power usage. What do?On behalf of LargeCoin, I can't say whether the ASIC Miner folks are legitimate, but I would be wary of any investment scheme that is not regulated by a reputable securities regulator like the SEC.

LargeCoin is a real project, and when we have something to announce, we will announce it to the list of people who have expressed interest.I have to go to dinner; I will return and answer more questions in about 60-90 mins."

Developers way underestimate the difficulty of re implementing the protocol. Bitcoinj is the closest there is and it has been under active development for quite a while. It has just now reached the point where it can do SPV mode.

There are so many subtle places where a re-implementation can appear to work correctly but over time will fork the block chain. IMO, there is no way a closed source version without the eyes of many bright people can be trusted to get it right. It will be a long time before any full re-implementation of the satoshi client appears on the scene.

2011-07-26 20:17:30;Trade Hill no longer accepting Dwolla;"Good job on maintaining your composure and professionalism. It is difficult being stonewalled while you are losing money. Feelings of helplessness and frustration are hard to avoid here.

I would have made mention of the lost capital in your letter to Dwolla (maybe that is just my emotional self)Sounds like we need something more like bitcoin to use to buy bitcoins. Wow wtf Dwolla?  Screwing over a business for ~$40k then either pretending it didn't happen or ignoring it is not good business practice.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/izrw7/dwolla_actually_reversible_tradehill_out_37k_or_so/Isn' this more or less a repeat of what happened with MtGox and PayPal a while back? 
Will MtGox drop Dwolla now?Well, this sucks. I actually used Dwolla->Tradehill as my means of buying BTC. Not sure what I will do now.I was surprised to see Tradehill go public in the forum post they made earlier today on this subject. But now things begin to make sense. Clearly this has been an ongoing issue between Tradehill and Dwolla for about 2 weeks and they have made no progress.

By going public and no longer accepting Dwolla they have raised the stakes quite dramatically.

It will be interesting to see whether Dwolla ""call"" them on it or ""fold"".Chargebacks spread through a financial system like a infection.  Imagine transferring from A to B to C.  If A allows chargebacks then B must allow it as well or wait until chargebacks are no longer allowed before transfering to C.  Now imagine what happens when chargebacks can happen for, say, 60 days and when money is moving around the system quickly.  Maintaining the chain of chargebacks must become quite complicated.

Chargebacks give some users warm fuzzy feelings (how do you prevent fraud?).  IMHO, the disease they case is worse than what they cure.Good move...

So... Moneypak?Well Dwolla, does want The Dwolla to succeed in mobile payments at some point. Bitcoin has spread much faster and quicker than the Dwolla from what I can when searching places that accept Dwolla as a payment. http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoin%2C+dwolla

Thinking about it that way after seeing the link, dwolla could actually completely fail soon.[deleted]This sucks because its some crappy users mucking up the system. I've had a number of simple and easy transactions with Dwolla, and I did like using them. The fact that they are ignoring this issue is very disappointing since in their website they pride themselves on being ""safer than credit cards"" while also being (relatively) anonymous. MtGox hasn't had any issues, and yet they seem like they would have been better/bigger targets.This sucks.  I understand why they've done this, but I'm cashing out my BTC from Tradehill.  I'll be damned if I'll pay $5 or possibly $25 to transfer USD back to my bank account.  That'll eat even further into the already minimal profit (or possible loss) that I see on my BTC trade.Just wait till r/tradehill hears about this...lol fine by me. go away trade hill.

Why is the amount 0.58 BTC, but the conversion 8.12 USD @ 14 BTC?

When does the merchant use the currency conversion?

Does the buyer get to see what they're purchasing on screen?

Do they see any discounts taken into account?

How does the buyer complete the transaction? Does the merchant prompt them to use a Bitcoin app on their phone?

Is there a wait period while the transaction is verified? What's happening during that time?

Where do you see people using this system?How about [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/j6k56/safebit_ui_refresh_would_like_to_hear_your/)?

It's Python on the back-end and HTML on the front-end.

For example on the customer screen it will only show the relevant information without all the extra UI."

1) ""% of market cap: 31.60 %"" --- what does this mean? 30% of market cap is $millions

2) For ""Investment to control 50%:"" are you taking into account that you would need >75% of the current hashing power (adding 50% and then taking half of that)Looks great! I think you made some reasonable assumptions and presented useful information. I've bookmarked this. Be sure to post it in /r/bitcoinmining!You can not estimate power consumption per gigahash or electricity cost without more information. Most major mining operations run the most efficient cards possible (less than 650 watts a giga hash) and in areas where electricity is significantly cheaper. 


But that's not the problem, your estimation on the cost of a 50% attack falls into the common trap of assuming you can **actually buy** large enough quantities of cards to preform a 51% attack. The mining community alone has the best cards sold out, and even in a best case scenario electricity, facilities and the costs for the rest of the machine (ram cpu mobo) push it well above your estimated number. My point is, the best mining cards are already in tight supply, there is no way any entity could gather up the needed number of cards in less than 6 months, and if they tried it would be obvious to everyone and their dog what they where doing. They only way to really get enough power is to manufacture the cards yourself, or seize every card factory on earth (or at least the vast majority) the first is massively expensive, the second would bring enough attention to Bitcoin to bring new miners using already purchased cards into the network, preventing an attack.

2011-08-30 17:07:16;Bitcoin: FBI Admits To Engaging In Infiltration, Disruption and Dismantling of Competing Currencies;"I think their easiest path is to try to undermine confidence in the system.  If they can keep people from using it out of fear, then they don't have to greatly risk showing the level of their interference.  A few simple hacks against poorly-defended exchanges or banks, setting up (or funding) phoney or scam services, playing up the threat of hackers raising questions about the fundamental soundness of the system, and let the fear multiply.

A good defense from this would be to suppress unfounded rumors and to trace these incidents back to infiltrators and expose them.Step 1) don't live in the US.

Step 2) see 1>âAttempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country **[ie. unconstitutional Federal Reserve notes]** are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism,â U.S. Attorney Tompkins said in announcing the verdict. âWhile these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence **[ie. they are voluntary systems with no victim]**, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country **[ie. their wide spread adoption may collapse the corrupt banking system]**,â she added. âWe are determined to meet these threats through infiltration, disruption, and dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government.â **[ie. we will engage in acts of domestic terrorism to prevent the voluntary trade of private property.]**

Jeeeeeeeeezus christ, there was more [sic] in there than quotes. I can think for myself, thanks!The [events this article alludes to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_von_NotHaus) has little to do with bitcoin.domestic terrorism never felt so damn good.This is old, recycled garbage. Why post about this now? This has nothing to do with legitimate alternative currencies and everything to do with Von NotHaus's intentionally misleading people with coins that he implies were backed by the US (they weren't) and whose face value was significantly higher than their precious metal value. I spoke to the prosecutor several months ago, after the conviction, and confirmed that this had nothing to do with a private currency. See my paper on ssrn (just google bitcoin ssrn) and search to find the detailed section that I wrote about this saga. 

I don't know why bitcoin supporters, private currency supporters, or libertarians keep on defending what he did and using the prosecution as an example of a government conspiracy and fear of competing currencies. There was poorly used language in the press, releases, yes, but it makes sense given the context: NotHaus was foisting his coins as a direct substitute for dollars without letting many people know that his money was different. Yes, there were people who knew what it was all about, but they are besides the point. He was no different than a common counterfeiter, or, as some overzealous prosecutors might say, a financial domestic terrorist. > For end users, this means you should not entrust the bulk of your coins to anyone but yourself.  You should operate your own Bitcoin client and keep any major holdings of coins off line in a file that is replicated and backed up on an encrypted drive.  All exchanges, wallet sites, and retail outlets should be presumed to be compromised.

The threats wont necessarily come from the feds.  There will be alot of powerful entities with strong incentives to undermine the system.  Also, the more prevalent bitcoin becomes, the more script-kiddies looking for an easy payday it will attract.

Protect yourself.  Some suggestions:

1) [Encrypt your wallet.dat file](http://plasticliving.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-preferred-way-to-backup-bitcoin.html).  Never leave an unencrypted copy lying around.

2) Assume every site accepting bitcoins is correlating BTC and IP addresses to either exploit, or to sell the data later.  Best case scenario these sites are juicy targets for crackers.  Use a [VPN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPN) to mask your IP address.  Pay people indirectly (ie: through mtgox or instawallet -- does instawallet payout from a different address than you pay into?  I've been meaning to check this) to mask your BTC address(es)
What can I say, mo money mo problems.>so we should expect to see more highly sophisticated attacks like the one which was perpetrated against Mt. Gox recently.

I didn't jump in to bitcoins to get rich, I use them to encourage the economy because once it stabilizes it will be the superior and terribly convenient currency system. I could stand ""loosing"" (for not selling at a higher price, not actually lost money hence the quotes) a few hundred dollars if it meant I could use BTC for most of my luxury (and hopefully other) purchases as well as a stable form of value storage which I control for the next 40 years.At present a $7.00 BitCoin is worth about 1.75 grains of $1900.00 Gold. I will be looking forward to seeing how that relationship develops and whether it remains stable. It seems a waste of effort to try to relate it to an method of exchange which is loosing value without a fundamental means of measurement. Therefore it makes more sense to measure the value directly whereby a grain of Gold has (for example, using the above numbers) a 0.5714 exchange rate with the BC.> and if the price goes down I know for sure that it will go back up in about a month or less.

I like how you're saying this after two months of steady decline in price.this is very true.  until the blockchain is broken Bitcoins can only go way up from here.  just be patient.I'm as pro-Bitcoin as anyone, but if it was a sure thing that they would double, then they'd already be at that 2x price."

**A.  - the OT network** :: an open decentralized  server network, for instant P2p BANKING, seems to promise ""low trust"" but less hackable platform for writing financial instruments.  *The key is coins move faster than on the miner based transactions.*  Some how some way you will be able to make real BTC deposits, like at the beginning of your day and then withdraw at the end of the day to house the bitcoins yourself.  My guess is that 2 types will like this platform::  

cyberpnks ((super concerned about being anon))

bitcoin intercommerce B2B ((business owners that work within the BTC economy as much as they can :: they need REAL TIME commercial banking like solutions))

 

**B. - the REAL bitcoin banks** :: coming soon secure & trusted layers of vault storage, may have to go thru several *poof and its gone* mtGox/mybitcoin type of events before anyone service provider gets there, they will also face the wrath of government law enforcement and likely will be subject to WWW3 type cyberattacks.

**C. - the bitcoin eCommerce Economy** :: this is where you buy things with them coins.  Security is not really an issue, but establishing trusted merchants and growth of multiple economy sectors is key.

**D. - eWallets** :: online apps that let you store small amounts of BTC, basically you store only your daily allowance here.  likely sits on your mobile device

**E. - client on PC** :: security is dependant on *YOU* ; rumour is that updated versions will help with encryption & preventions ... but only a fool would hold more than a weeks pay on the working *wallet.dat* 

**F. - the money exchangers** :: gettin fiat money exchanged into BTC, *visa versa*, lots of players making money off of money, well maybe just one so far ... *cough* ... Gox ...  ... *cough* ... Key is easy to put cash in and pull cash out, right now it's so-so.  Likely need more small amount providers (for the n00bs) ... using google.checkout or taking wired bank payments.

**G. - offline storage** :: security is dependant on *YOU* ;  lots of easy solutions ... key is really deleting the original from your online PC ... I am envisioning lots of USB sticks worth more than their weight in gold.

**H. - the big Bad banks** :: aka the enemy ... the goal is getting them back into their original business of Vault keeping ... that should be easy :/ 

... perhaps the majority of BTC participants will also cluster together with bank accounts on the same banking networks ... so far ... Citybank&WellsFargo / ING Direct / Dwolla ... all allow very cheap intrabanking.

2011-09-13 13:46:46;Votecoin;"There's no benefit in doing this with bitcoin. Government setting up initial accounts would know everyone identity anyway. Voting would not be instant because transactions has to be first put into blockchain and processing so many transactions created one day would be just harder for Bitcoin than for the system design for it. Not to mention lack of initiative for people to run miners in the first place.

Well. Unless I've missed something in your idea, it's just plainly stupid, sorry.Seems like overkill when it could be solved by simple public key cryptography: each citizen having a private key with the government knowing their public key. They just announce their single vote to the government server or to the world if you're feeling more peer-to-peer-y, and second votes are ignored.Generally, it sounds like a good idea. Some things:  
- I don't see why it would need to be a central set of wallets. Instead each citizen could have their own address and get sent their coin for each election.  
- You would need multiple coins types because each election is not just for one person. For example, it might be the president, a senator, a congressperson, a govenor, a few state officials, a mayor, a few judges, and a city councilperson. Then there are also state ballot initiatives. Each thing you can vote on would need a diferent coin type because you wouldn't want someone to use their judge vote to give the presidential candidate more votes.  
- this still doesn't make things ""secure"" because things can be changed at the point of the polling booth. Selecting candidate A might still send the coin to candidate B. Because the voter doesn't control the machine, they really don't know what they are voting. I tend to prefer systems that print a summary of the votes which the voter approves and then drops the summary into a collection area for validation later if there is any question of vote tampering.Yes, this would work great, in the mythical society where every citizen worked in the IT industry and ran linux on their desktopBitcoin is just based on the idea of signed transactions. That stuff has been well understood for a long time.  But your idea here is taking a bunch of stuff that's in bitcoin and 'bringing it back' to solve a much simpler problem. 


All you have to do to have electronic voting is give each citizen a private key, and have them fill out an electronic ballot and have them digital sign it.  There's no need to include the concepts of a 'wallet' or 'payments' or anything else. 

The problem with this is, like bitcoin, it wouldn't be anonymous. You would be able to see the public key of the voter, just like you can see the bitcoin address (and public key) of people who spend bitcoin. 

The other problem is the problem bitcoin faces:  Hacking. You know all the worry people have about voting machines: well, people's PCs 100x worse in terms of security. If people could vote from ordinary machines there would be a clusterfuck of political parties trying to get people to run software to do their voting for them, hacking, the whole mess.  Just like there's hacking now for bitcoin. 

TL;DR: 1) You don't need all the complexity of bitcoin, simple pubic key crypto and document signing is enough and 2) This would get hacked to hell. 

If you gave everyone a secure device to vote on, that would be good You're missing an interesting point, that people could give their votes to other people and this would be logged.  I've nothing against votes being given to more politically-minded people than myself but I would take issue with large-scale vote buying, and that would become apparent by viewing the chain.It would certainly drive up the price of GPUs among politicians."
2011-09-20 22:18:12;Will this blow to the gambling establishment promote bitcoin gambling sites?;"[deleted]Will the fact that one gambling site was shown to be a scam promote bitcoin sites, known mostly for tending to be scams? Well, it sounds logical to me!I'd be really surprised if current bitcoin gambling sites weren't doing the same with their banks. At the very least they are likely playing the market with the funds invested. 

Bitcoin doesn't really offer any protection at all.  But one thing you CAN do with bitcoin that's more difficult with other currencies is deposit your money when you want to play, then withdraw it automatically. 

What would be really interesting if there was a way to encode a poker game in a bitcoin script so that the money would be held in a 'superposition' of all the players accounts until the point at which someone won. No.One criticism on the article:

> âFull Tilt insiders lined their own pockets with funds picked from the pockets of their most loyal customers while blithely lying to both players and public alike about the safety and security of the money deposited with the company,â Bharara said in a statement. He called it âa global Ponzi scheme.â

Why does everything that's unstable/unsustainable/whatever have to be a Ponzi scheme? The phrase ""Ponzi scheme"" has a very specific meaning, and this isn't it - ""fractional reserve banking"" is much more appropriate.No, I don't think so. The government leaning on the bit poker sites for accepting what amounted to bank transfers did help bitcoin out (I know because it was a motivator for me to get into it, and I know other poker people who felt the same way). But all this does is bring scandal to poker, and a bitcoin poker site operator can (and has) done the same thing. In fact, since there's no standards of accounting and a layer of anonymity, you could say that this is even more able to happen in a bitcoin place."
2011-09-20 20:23:06;Bitcoinica's Recent Data Errors;"I'm really rooting for Bitcoinica to succeed.  Margin trading in the volatile Bitcoin market is genius, and it's a hell of a lot of fun!

But as much fun as it is, I won't trust more than pocket change to this site, at least not yet.  Here's what I've seen in about 90 minutes goofing around with small amounts of USD and BTC over the weekend:

1. I withdrew 8 times more USD than I had in my account.
2. I withdrew 40 times more BTC than I had in my account.
3. Gains and losses on trades didn't affect my balance.

Naturally, I returned the funds sent to me by mistake, and at least the first two vulnerabilities seem to be fixed now.  But what about the determined and skilled attackers out there?

I hope Bitcoinica makes it big, and I'll keep filing bug reports.  I also hope the words of [HN commenter jellicle](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2973301) aren't prophetic for Bitcoinica:

> -- systems that work with money are attacked hard and often, by intelligent skilled people
> -- in fact some of the people who attack your system are likely to be both more skilled and more intelligent than you are
> -- systems that work with money that fail, fail spectacularly (""What do you mean someone withdrew $8 million last night?"")
> -- banking websites, Paypal, etc. are all like icebergs - you don't see 9/10ths of the things they've done to prevent spectacular failure
> -- spectacular failure is your destiny if you don't work very hard to prevent it
> -- spectacular failure may be your destiny even if you do work very hard to prevent itHeh ... 
""We hope our resolution for this recent issue is much more professional than simply reverse the trades"".
While the expertise behind Bitcoinica is arguable, I have been loving the site itself.

Their handling of this matter was, to me, quite elegant.  Prompt response, resolution, and open communication.  I couldn't really ask for more.Ruby on Rails = amateur hour.

2011-09-20 18:40:25;The Current Problems of Bitcoin;"FTA: ""...you also have to ensure that as soon as the transaction takes place you convert your BTC back into USD""

This is one of the major problems right here. We need vendors who are willing to sell in bitcoins and the use the bitcoins to buy other stuff, like supplies or groceries. Until we reach a certain tipping point where people actually want to sell for bitcoins and HOLD bitcoins, the volatility of BTC will be crazy. 

Another issue this article misses is scalability. This, in my mind, is the *primary* challenge for the bitcoin dev team.The key word here is 'current'. None of those are inherent and will be resolved over the next few years.


Though I'm not sure if I'd classify the volatility as a problem - it attracts speculators who give us much needed liquidity. It's not like the merchants have to manually relabel all their merchandise - this is all automatic. Stability will come with higher volumes - right now a few hundred thousand dollars can move the market 20%...I thought portable devices only download a portion of the block chain?And regarding #2: Usually when you make a transaction in the real-world the confirmation takes a few seconds to happen.
EFT's, even the fastest, take several days, sometimes weeks, and cost exorbitant fees. They can be canceled or challenged at multiple points in the chain, and are subject to taxes, plus government and private regulations.
Physical transfers of currency can take place in a few seconds. But that, too, has problems... many of which bitcoin solves.Regarding #4, if the attacker with the ""vast array of computing power"" can still do little.  See: http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Anyone_with_enough_computing_power_can_take_over_the_network

At the current the difficulty level, an attack costs well more than $10 million of hardware.  If the intention is solely to harm bitcoin then yes, bitcoin has this vulnerability.  If the intention is to double spend against a merchant (such as an exchange) an attack would be found out long before bogus transactions worth even a decent fraction of that $10 million will clear.

Regarding #4, if the attacker with the ""vast array of computing power"" can still do little.  See: http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Anyone_with_enough_computing_power_can_take_over_the_network

At the current the difficulty level, an attack costs well more than $10 million of hardware (or a cartel made of pools, perhaps).  If the intention is solely to harm bitcoin then yes, bitcoin has this vulnerability.  If the intention is to double spend against a merchant (such as an exchange) an attack would be found out long before bogus transactions worth even a decent fraction of that $10 million will clear.I think the points made in the article are valid. My proposal for a solution to the refunds issue is to make a refunds policy that uses the local currency exchange rate.  So if you buy an 4BTC and want a refund after a massive fluctuation then you get more or fewer BTC depending.

And this is only an issue when merchants exchange BTC immediately.  It can be mitigated by holding the BTC for each purchase until after the return period expires.

And did you send all 6 BTC from computer A to computer B or just parts of it?

Are you running the standard Bitcoin client or some zero-fee-patched client?

If the transaction is indeed ""0/unconfirmed"" then you won't see it on blockexplorer, as you can only see transactions there that are already in a block. You might want to check this list http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/ which shows currently unconfirmed transactions.

Another thing to check: How many active connections do you have? (lower right corner).

You most certainly have not lost any Bitcoins as long as you make sure to have backup copies of all wallets involved. It might just be tricky to get them ""unstuck"", although the first step would be to better understand why they did get stuck in the first place.Can you find MtGox->local wallet transfer in block explorer? If it shows incoming txn but no outgoing txn then, in theory, you haven't lost it, as long as you still have private key associated with it.

2011-09-27 19:50:26;How to measure network partition susceptibility?;"THe number of clients wouldn't really have an effect on the likelyhood of your transaction being ""wiped out"". Really it only matters if the mining power e.g. the major pools split, you could monitor this quite simple by collecting a list of the major pools ips and making sure your client is connected to the majority of them.
Perhaps there could be a warning in the client to tell users when the computational power falls 50% or more so they can make judgments as to weather or not to use BitCoin at that point in time.
>But this is not really a solution for anyone who relied upon transactions in the shorter chain.

Lets say I'm in a small community and we've been mining without an internet connection for a while.  We work on the blockchain, solving blocks and winning Bitcoin.  The transactions that we spend in our small community will be broadcast by the sending node to all the others and as the other nodes receive the transaction, they will put it in the blockchain in the order they received the transaction.

Then, someone in our little community sets up IP over radio, or a satellite link, or a pringles cantenna connection to the rest of the world.  They download the longer blockchain and begin sharing it with nodes in our little community.  When a node receives this longer blockchain, they will take the transactions they know about in their shorter blockchain and put them in the new one *in order*.  All the transactions that took place in the small community will still be ""received"" by the nodes in order, and they will simply start trying to solve blocks using these transactions that were not included in the longer chain.

So, what happens to all those coins that people in the little community ""won"" by mining?  Well, you can't spend them for 120 blocks; the idea being that someone in your community is going to make connection with the outside world and download the longer chain before you have an opportunity to spend them.

So, you could double-spend if you had your wallet on both sides of the connection break, and you can spend won coins after 120 blocks.  In these two situations, someone is going to lose some coins, but it is unlikely that someone is going to get their wallet on both sides of the connection without bringing the blockchain (if it were that easy to get to the other network, others will be doing the same thing) and because *someone* is going to get a link up, it is unlikely that they will be isolated for longer that 120 blocks.

edit: it's also relevant to mention that when bitcoin is sent, it is the number of *confirmations* that gives the recipient ""certainty"" that they have received coins.  If you don't feel comfortable with only 6 confirmations, you can wait for 7, or 8, or 1000 before you provide whatever service or commodity you were selling.

edit2: Oh, and the blockchain can also be shared via sneaker-net.  You don't *need* an internet connection to use bitcoin, but you'd want to wait for quite a few confirmations."

how much has it lost since july 1st?  not very much

and if you compare it with may prices, bitcoin has gained... Seems like this sort of headline promotes Bitcoin-as-an-asset rather than Bitcoin-as-a-currency. Of course it is many things to many people.And there are significantly more coins in actual circulation.  When old money cashes out, it drops the price and makes bitcoin more accessible.

Also, when the price says ""30 dollars"" on mtgox, that just means that one person was willing to pay 30 dollars for one bitcoin.  Then the people willing to buy at 30 got what they wanted, and no one has been willing to buy at 30 since.

The equivent of what you are saying is that in the run up to $35, for it to have happened it would require that $210,000,000 entered the bitcoin economy. And that isnt true either. But if you stay with your calculations...since $210,000,000 was the amount it went up, when only about $12,000,000 actually entered the economy, then by that ratio we only need about $60,000 to enter the bitcoin economy per month for prices to maintain.

I did learn that the biggest hurdle is that loans would be difficult to pay back if issued with a deflationary currency, which is kindof obvious. Might this be solved by having the borrower issue shares in exchange for bitcoin using the GLBSE?That would be a massive win for bitcoin. I for one would consider using some of the bitcoins I've earned making software for kiva.This is so awesome! I've always thought the key to Bitcoins success is not in First world countries but developing countries or countries without such a stable economy. 

The main benefits of bitcoin (can't be taken by the government, easily traded without middle men, and are a global currency) are all much bigger benefits for those in the developing world. 

If Kiva got behind this it would be a massive boon for both Bitcoin and Kiva. "

2. It only makes it more difficult to donate, as a tiny percentage of those interested in donating have bitcoins.
3. Even when the protesters received the bitcoins, they would then need to exchange them for USD to actually use them.
4. Making signs about abandoning fiat currency only makes the protesters look foolish, and makes them less likely to be taken seriously.
5. What exactly are the advantages of bitcoin that you think apply in this case? I cannot think of any that are not contrived.
OccupyWallstreet does accept bitcoin donations.  However, the reality is that there's a big difference between the policies that OWS is promoting and what bitcoin is about. OWS wants to fix income and wealth inequality, while bitcoin is more about making it easy to transfer money on the internet, and liberate people from using a government backed currency.  

It doesn't really help with income inequality, in fact because if bitcoin ever became super-popular it could make income inequality worse. I've watched this idea come and go.  The main problem is that BitCoin has been labeled as a ponzi scheme.  While those that claim this have a point that latecomers to the BitCoin system contribute wealth to those who got in early, **they miss the fact that the Federal Reserve is a far greater scam that has ripped off more wealth than all the currency in existence.**No. how does adopting a currency that overtime has proved to be a pyramid scheme help the ows.movement at all.

You clearly didn't read the last sentence in that post.

This man is merely a battle-scarred troll warrior. His post should be in the Reddit FAQ. :PEither way, it must have been posted by a redditor. I agree.I don't see why there is so much contention about what ""types"" of people use bitcoin. If any given individual user sees a benefit in using bitcoin, they should use it. This is akin to saying that you shouldn't use cash because someone you politically disagree with uses cash. It's simply a medium of exchange, and granted it's not useful for everyone right now, but that is what the community should be focused on, not which political factions find use out of it currently.

Full disclosure: I am a libertarian, and believe that commerce is the truest and most practical way to peace and productivity. People will fight for many reasons, but they are much less likely to do it if they are financially interdependent with the person they want to swing the axe against. With this in mind, there is no reason why the bitcoin community can't pursue their own individual interests to allow bitcoin to  evolve into a platform that many many more people can find use in, and even to such an extent that it becomes a mainstream currency. 
Bitcointalk is full of delusional ""Austrian economists"" who think they're super-geniuses who are a combination of the next George Soros and Mark Zuckerburg combined. 

Who of course meanwhile scare off anyone who's both normal and interested in bitcoin by acting like political nutbags who are one step above people who think black-helicopters are sapping their vital essences.  

If the people saying bitcoin is great seem crazy when they talk about politics or monetary policy, then they are just going to assume that bitcoin is just a crazy idea. 

And here's the thing. Even if you think, for example, that the gold standard is the way to go and that the government is impediment to freedom,  Getting in someone's face and simply stating for a fact that the world works in a way that they don't think it works is just going to get you written off as crazy. 

It would be much, much better if the central location for the discussion and development of bitcoin weren't also a hive of what people think of as crazy. 

The original idea spread bitcoin through libertarian as well as geek sphere was a good one, but I think it's gotten a little out of control and hampered bitcoin acceptance. 

What's really caused problems, though is all the hacks. Once Bitcoin has a long-term reputation of being safe, people will be more interested in it. That might take years though.

- The order screens don't show you how much money you have. Making orders is a real pain compared to MtGox.

- They don't show you the bid/ask. (The ""instant buy/sell"" prices are **not** the bid/ask prices.)

**And my withdraw requests have been ""in process"" for an hour.** (They are not yet broadcast.)

That bid wall has nothing to do with leverage, which Bitcoinica does not provide via lending.

This is very inaccurate. There is no devastating flaw in the protocol, just a theoretical flaw found in a model that may or may not be an accurate representation of the factors in play in a future bitcoin network, and I'm betting not.âThe paper describes a very interesting theoretical problem but I doubt there will be any need to implement their solutions anytime soon.â Won't this only become relevant once rewards for finding blocks drops significantly? In the scenario they described, they almost completely ignored that reward, treating it as though it doesn't exist. It wouldn't be a problem until mining is over. Right now mining fees are much, much higher then TX fees. lol, retarded newspaperAs far as I understand, the propagation of transactions has nothing to do with the protocol as such. It's an entirely different matter. We could be phone calling each other to inform of new transactions, or sending them in letters - it would be stupid an inefficient, but not a property of the Bitcoin protocol itself.This is so dumb. I am surprised no one pointed this out yet. 90% of miners are into pools. So in effect there are about 5 mining nodes. The 50,000 other nodes are ""wallet nodes"". Each node is connected to 8 clients. Each wallet node have the advantage to pass all transactions to others node. So what is described in the article is never going to happen."

Bitcoin 24/7: This a service that we use to handle our Bitcoin payments, but it is not necessary for customers (players on Switch Poker) to signup to or use Bitcoin247.com. When depositing you will be presented with a Bitcoin address to send payments to and there is no need to create an account on Bitcoin 24/7. Likewise for withdrawals; you can withdraw to any Bitcoin address - no Bitcoin 24/7 account is required.


Anonymity: The quote in the press release was referring to Bitcoin as a whole and what it is capable with respect to anonymous payments. Switch Poker requires users to enter details before playing as part of 'Know Your Customer' compliance.


Switch Poker Liquidity: As mentioned, Switch Poker does not have the volume of the likes of Poker Stars just yet (although it's kicking Full Tilt's ass ;), but it is not at all bad. Most players on SP are European based and the peak hours are 7pm to midnight GMT, where there are invariably a couple of â¬1/â¬2 NLH and â¬2/â¬4 NLH games going. Last week saw a record week in terms of hands played, and the the two millionth hand mark was recently passed.

Thanks for all the upvotes. Please keep the comments coming. We are listening. I was about to say ""no no there are a million bitcoin poker and gambling sites"". But [Switch Poker](https://www.switchpoker.com/) is an established (how established?) real money poker site, with some pretty cool software for the iPad/iPhone from the looks of it.

And more importantly, coverage by MarketWatch is a fairly big news hit for Bitcoin, although they don't exactly put bitcoin in the most positive light (focusing on the difficulty of governments to track/control the currency and the resulting negative opinions of some governments directed toward Bitcoin).Just ran a trial by depositing some money with a Visa and withdrawing via Bitcoin.

2011-11-29 13:06:24;Infinite filesize blocks?;"The idea of ""super-blocks"" could remedy the problem. for instance, every 200k blocks, a summary of all the bitcoin addresses and their balances ever seen could be computed and processed just like the normal block chain. Then clients could decide to either process the entire normal blockchain, or start processing at any super-block they wanted and catch up to date with the normal blocks from that starting point.The protocol allows you to transact using headers only. This is what BitcoinJ does.there are lots of possibilities what could happen. first, in a situation like this a ""regular"" user will not download the whole blockchain but rely on a service provider somewhere using split key crypto to perform day-to-day transactions.

second, even those service providers will start to use clustering somehow.

also, some people propose that even for that to happen, the bitcoin network will not scale infinitely but it will rather only include ""expensive"" transactions. ""micro"" transactions will have to be performed out of band between service providers.Some possible solutions:

- ""Snapshots"" of the block chain
- Lite clients, which do not store blockchain or only blockchain headers (bitcoinspinner, bitcoinj) becoming widely adopted for common user, while miners and professional services run full clientsAside from tech that allows people to either create smaller block chains, use only portions of the block chain, you also need to keep perspective.  10 years ago, the current size would be a problem.  Currently, our hard drive space increases so quickly and cheaply, I don't think it will ever be a problem.

""The block chain is 10GB!!!""

""So what... my USB stick is 128GB.""You may want to read the original Bitcoin paper (http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). I think it discussed that problem and ended up saying it won't be a problem with the the ever increasing hard disk capacities.You are right, but from what I remember it's not really a problem.  There will be two major changes by the time the blockchain approaches a terrabyte in size.
1.  Lightweight clients (I use one on my phone in fact)  where the private keys are stored on your phone but the client syncs to a server hosted blockchain for the app.
2.  Harddrives will be bigger by then.  Mass adoption will take a long time and harddrives seem to double in size every year."

2011-12-20 23:40:01;Next Leg Up: Potentially $80/Bitcoin;"Can we please not do this to ourselves _again_?I hope not.  I hope it moves slowly.  

If BitCoin is to have a lasting impact, people need to have confidence in it's value on a daily basis.  If the price can move as much as 50% in an hour, it destroy it's usefulness as a medium of exchange.  Think about it.  If you are a buyer and your BTC increased 50% in one day, would you think twice about exchanging the BTC for goods or would you think ""I'd better hold for a little longer until this move is done.""  On the flip side, if you are a seller of goods and the value drops by 50% in one hour, you may turn the buyer away until the downward move finishes.

If BTC is to reach the $20, $80, $100, or $1000, mark, it has to have slow steady progress over a period of years so people feel confident they are not being cheated when exchanging with this new system.  **Posting about the technical aspect of the graphs and what not only serves to appeal to greed or fear.**  Greed or fear makes the value fluctuate wildly and destroys the long term potential of BitCoin by destroying the trust in it's value.I think that his prediction is a bit optimistic.  The average taken during his extrapolation includes the hype spike, which is not indicative of future gains.

I follow the bitcoin religiously and believe that $15-$20 is more reasonable based on the Elliot Wave Analysis.Merchants are not currency traders. They just want to sell their goods for a profit. 

By pricing their goods in the current immediate price of bitcoins and then immediately cashing out to their local currency they avoid currency risk. No buy and hold, just using bitcoins as a medium of value transfer. 

For example, as a merchant I buy some mugs for $1. I need to sell these mugs for $2 to turn a profit allowing for all my overheads. I want to avoid payment card charges so I sell them in bitcoins. 

A customer shows up at my store, so I look at the current rate (say 1 BTC = $2) so I show him a price of 1 BTC. They decide to buy so I put up a bitcoin address and wait for it to appear on the blockchain credited with 1 BTC. 

That happens, so after some confirmations to be sure I cash out my BTC only to find that the price has moved a little bit in the 20 minutes I held that bitcoin so now 1 BTC = $2.02. Yay, a sliver of extra profit! 

I made what I needed and took advantage of the amazing utility of bitcoins as a transfer of value. I certainly don't buy and hold and I don't ever care what the exchange rate is.

The customer can do the same, once they have an account on the exchange. They buy the bitcoins when they need them, or accept the currency risk."

People would buy and it would move to $2.50. He would then put a buy order at $2.40 and it would move to $2.60. He sold his Bitcoins at $2.60, the same ones he bought at $2.35. After that he would remove the buy wall and it would usually crash back to $2.35 or $2.30. He the repeated and made a bunch of money.I guarantee it's happening.

Currently it would take only a couple of millions of dollars in investment to take over the Bitcoin network with computing power. Thus deciding which transactions get confirmed and which are left out. Something that can be brought to a halt with only a few million dollars invested is incredibly risky.
But in the future who knows? I can't tell. But I hope somewhere near the bottom.Because there are so many ways the value of BTC could fail and because the price flies all over the place, I would classify BitCoins at the derivatives level.  I'm not saying that it IS a derivative, but rather it's risk characteristics make it like a derivative.  Further, I'm not saying that BitCoins are a bad bet or investment.  On the contrary, because there is such a phenomenal upward potential, I would call BitCoins a good investment... but only in small amounts.

It's sorta like a lottery where the payoff is $10 million, and there are only 1 million tickets.  The odds are great, but if you're entire savings is only $10k and your job situation is shaky, should you spend every dollar buying tickets?Probably paper money.

Once you have 1, every new blocked mined (avg: 1 every 10 minutes) will increase your confirm count.iirc fees are used mostly to speed sub 1Btc transactions. If your sending amount is over 1btc you don't need the fee. It's to keep people from ddosing the network with tons of low amount transactions. I might be wrong however. MtGox has a deal with a mining pool ([Eligius](http://eligius.st/wiki/index.php/Eligius_mining_pool)) and they will prioritise transactions that MtGox white-list.

They definitely white-list transactions out, but I don't know about transactions inGood info about transaction fees from David Schwartz http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/190I definitely know NOT paying fee will significantly slow transaction noticeably, sometimes it gets stuck forever, a couple of times I even had to rebuild the wallet.dat to un-stuck the transaction.

So you can attempt to spend coins without reviewing the blockchain. Whether it will be accepted by miners of course requires that the coins are there to be spent. BCCAPI is something that is used to query for such information so the entire blockchain need not be downloaded by a mobile client like, for example, BitcoinSpinner for Android.Also be sure to check out [Stratum, the proposed Overlay Network](http://stratum.bitcoin.cz/). It will allow a whole range of nearly-zero-trust thin clients.The do still have a blockchain it's just that it's on a server somewhere.
2012-01-10 19:20:28;"How does a group use BitCoins on an ongoing basis?  
Accounting, security, access all become issues.";"Sigh. Bitcoin is not a solution to every financial situation imaginable, any more than cash is.

Think of bitcoin as digital cash, or a protocol. How does physical cash solve any of the problems you've outlined? It doesn't, and you don't stuff a bunch of physical cash in a vault that everyone has access to when you work for a big company.

We build services on top of bitcoin that solve all of the problems you enumerate, the same way that we build services that use physical cash that solve the problems you mention if you were storing your company value in physical cash.

There are so many different ways to solve the issues that you mentioned that I don't really know where to begin, because it depends greatly on the particular situation.

Right now, since we don't have a comprehensive service that is tailored to a company's use of bitcoin as a main store of value, (and since bitcoin is too volatile right now to use as a company chest), you could simply use bitcoin for what it's good at right now -- value transfer -- instead of value storage.

But if you want to use bitcoins as value storage for your company, then you can store your bitcoins wallet in a piece of software that requires multiple users to enter their passwords in order to move money out of the wallet if the amount is over a specified limit.

Each user has an account that can access the software individually, and they have a limit on what they can withdraw, to change the limit, multiple high ranking individuals have to enter their password together in order to change the limit.

Currently at [Ferroh](https://ferroh.com), **we are developing a service (almost done too!) that stores our bitcoins redundantly across many wallets (any number you want) and many computers**.

Each time you add a computer and a wallet, you make a physical paper wallet copy and put a copy of the (laminated) paper wallet in a safety deposit box and another copy in a safe.

When someone wants to withdraw money, a request is posted to a central server, and all of the wallet machines poll the server every few minutes, checking for requests. One of the wallet machines usually needs to win a lottery (unless it has way more bitcoins than the other machines) to be the machine that gets to fulfil the withdraw request.

If you pull a machine offline, the other machines can still fulfil the request. If you make a massive request, then the machines see coins moving from the public addresses of other machines in this group *by monitoring the public blockchain*, and then they halt and require multiple authorizing signatures from officials to continue.

In this way, you can distribute coins across many locations, machines, and networks, and protect your organization's value despite many people in your organization needing access to your bitcoins. It also mitigates the damage of a cracker stealing your coins, because you are limited to taking all the coins from 2-3 machines out of potentially hundreds, before they refuse to fill requests until they get multiple authority's signatures.

What's nice about this is that **you dont need the massive secure central server room** with 100 feet walls of concrete or whatever. You can just store 1000 bitcoins on a laptop in each of your employees living rooms -- and everything will work. If that employee steals the coins, he loses his job, and your company moves on. If a few employees computers break or are lost or whatever, the network still works, just temporarily without a few coins in the chest. If their house/apartment burns to the ground you can still get the coins from the wallet (paper backup at his safety deposit box).split-key, a feature that might be available in the .6 qt client will require signatures from multiple keys before bitcoins can be spent. With this, you can require two accountants to sign a transaction, or one accountant and the CFO - just about any combination of required signatures can be designed but I heard that in the beginning, there will be just a couple of scenarios covered like 2-3 person combos.The questions you raise have nothing to do with Bitcoin.  Would you give access to the wallet to your entire company any more than you would give access to the bank account?  As you indicate, the CFO or financial department should have access to such.  The multiple risks you identify are easily addressed by a disaster recovery plan and hopefully choosing a trustworthy CFO.  None of these risks are unique to Bitcoin and can easily be associated with access to a USD bank account.  Your final risks can all be alleviated by using basic encryption, access and keys to which again can be included in a disaster recovery plan in case something happens to the individuals who regularly have access.All of these problems exist with a cash system.  Accountants call the systems in place to keep fraud and the other problems you mentioned in check ""internal controls.""  These systems aren't perfect but they do help prevent fraud.  If you stop in /r/accounting a bunch of eager nerds who do this professionally will gladly chat with you about internal controls and their implementation.I have a rule.  Private keys should never leave the macheine they were generated on.  This goes for SSL certs, SSH keys, and sure as hell, bitcoin wallets.

If the funds are to be distributed among a few people, everyone can either use their own wallets, or trust a centralized service that users need to log in to when they want to send coins.

Wallets to generate receiving addresses could be stored on web facing servers, and then have the contents dumped to more trusted wallets at regular intervals (the more secure wallet doesn't even need to be online for this to happen).

In the end, this is just a bit of code moving around, and is a hell of a lot easier than dealing with banks, direct deposit, ACH transactions etc.  Intuit and ADP etc make a fortune because dealing with US dollars is hard, whereas you could probably pay a highschool kid a couple hundred dollars to do something similar with bitcoin.That's pretty much the same as handling a group Twitter account or any other group-controlled resource: you need a middleman and an admin interface. You'd have a bitcoin client as secured as possible and you would expose an interface to group admins. Each admin would have a different password  (do NOT share passwords). And if you want, you can require each transaction to be approved by, at least, two admins.

I haven't done this with bitcoin, but I have done similar things for groups using IRC/web/telnet interfaces. It's an old problem with old solutions ;-)"

[(1)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=59980.msg697793#msg697793)Bought on the downswing, ready to reap profits on the upswing :)Someone dumped a large amount of coins on the market which knocked down the market price quite a bit. This probably had a cascading effect as bots with stop loss functionality triggered sell orders on any open positions dumping even more coins on the market. AKA Flash Crash.

At least that's what my bot tried to do -- Luckily I was at my computer so I intervened and shut the bot down.
Some people in the speculation section of BitcoinTalk are pointing fingers at Bitcoinica as the cause of this downswing.People who bought in at $2.50 have decided it's time to dump?Time to buy!Just got home, see this post, mild panic, peak at the price...it's sitting close enough to $7 for me to feel comfortable...

...look at today's trade history, clean pants, count lucky stars.I dunno, but MtGox Live is down and my orders are taking forever...as far as i can read it seems the individual(s) involved in crashing btc today actually lost out... is this true? I had a weird feeling this was going to happen and luckily was able to sell and buy back in lower. I missed the $4.61 floor though.I lost $300back up to 5.2 volatility is insane right now. and ya of course gox live goes downmy biggest problem is I never have ANY cash or BTC in mtgox... 

for security, I keep my BTC offline.

Because i'm all pump, no dump, anytime there is money in mtgox it's already backed by a buy order.[deleted]"

Second, what proposed law? Third, you can't break a proposed law because it's not law yet!This is excellent. Could be useful for scientists - you can't publish a result in a major paper until you gather enough evidence, but you can prove you were working on it first.

2012-01-24 20:04:08;Reddit/Digg like clone - vote up posts with 0.001 bitcoins;"Why spend bitcoins (even just a fraction) to vote on stuff that you can already do for free? I can appreciate the concept and execution, but the reasoning is beyond me.I dont get it? Why should I vote?Great to see this! 

This is a little smoother than Witcoin's approach which had required registration and a balance (2 confirmations after payment if I remember correctly) before any actions could be performed.

I suspect spamming will be a problem -- I have 4X the leverage by voting up my own posts (I pay 1 BTC and get 0.8 BTC back, so the net cost to boost my own post to the top was 0.2 BTC.)

Great to see though, best of luck with it!I created a site where you can post links, videos, images, and blobs of text (html allowed).

It works much like most social news sites where visitors can vote up stories they like to the home page in various different categories. The difference is that the voting is in bitcoins in increments of 0.001 units. 80% of the bitcoins received go to the poster of the article.

Posting and voting up articles is an anonymous process, and no login is needed (also IP addresses & sessions are not recorded). For those that are into Tor, onion links are welcome and are marked with an onion icon. Hopefully this will help with the discovery of content on the onion network. This will inevitably look exactly like reddit's front page if it takes off.I think they problem you are trying to solve (people throwing out upvotes to anything) will be offset by users doing any thing they can get to get upvotes (as they make money). The is just Karma on steroids. Maybe I am wrong, but I feel like there is a potential for even more cute cat videos than ever.I had the same idea time ago, and I didn't know of Witcoin.  I think 0.001 BTC is kind of expensive.  If I had to pay for every link or comment I vote up or down in Reddit and Hacker News, I would spend a considerable amount.

It should cost a sathoshi per upvote or downvote.why would anyone use this when they can upvote elsewhere at sites with more established communities for free?I've had a (more complex) version of this idea in the back of my head for about three years.  Using Bitcoin solves a lot of the problems with the implementation that I was wrestling with.  Very cool to see someone do something like this.  Good luck!Witcoin?
Please vote up on hacker news:
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3507448I made like 200 bucks a day just down-voting everything. The future is now.I just downvoted this *for free*!What a poor idea. This will only give more control to spammers.

2012-01-24 10:39:29;So how do I start?;"You don't *have* to mine. There are a bunch of ways to get bitcoin, but the one that helps the community the most is by providing goods and services in exchange for bitcoin.

Are you good at photoshopping stuff?  Start a website and charge a few bitcoin for simple projects.

Do you have any junk laying around your house?  Sell it on a bitcoin auction site, or even Craigslist for bitcoin.

You can optionally purchase some bitcoin via a trading site like MtGox.

If you do want to mine, sign up at a [mining pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/) since solo-mining is becoming obsolete unless you have ridiculously expensive and powerful hardware..I've got a steady stream of $20 going to my exchange account. Some bitcoins go into cold storage for investment and savings, the rest go to my phone so I can pay friends for covering my beer and lunch tabs. 

Set up a dwolla.com account, link your bank account. Setup an exchange account and start buying Bitcoin. Use it as described above. You'll discover how fun it is to talk about it with your friends and family and disperse the currency at the same time.Mining is not how you as a consumer get bitcoins.  Just like mining for gold is not how you as a consumer get gold coins.  Just like printing isn't how you as a consumer get dollar bills.

Mining is simply a lottery based mechanism for rewarding the people who run the larger computers that maintain the ledgers and cryptography that keep track of the transactions.

The way you acquire bitcoins is by buying them, or providing a service in return for it.  In this it is the same as dollar bills, euros, or gold coins.

You might also try a bit of panhandling over at the bitcoin faucet.People who laugh at Bitcoin = ignorant. As for mining: have you read [Weusecoins](http://www.weusecoins.com)? Have you read the mining guide?**is** pretty cool, not ""would be"".

2012-01-31 17:25:27;How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People;"Luke Jr. is accused of being a poisonous person.  Specifically he is accused of creating extra [BIPs, or BitCoin Improvment Proposals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals).  These are proposals relating to the bitcoin protocal that are voted on with mining power.  

[BIP 16](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0016) and [BIP 17](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0017) are beyond my ability to comprehend.  

[BIP 20](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0020) and [BIP 21](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021) both deal with an official bitcoin URI standard.  

Luke Jr's (20) proposal is overly complicated.  LukeJr's BIP allows for values to be encoded in decimal, hexidecimal or tonal (wtf) values.  It also allows for transmitting private keys.  Private keys are suppose to remain private and not end up in URIs.    

BIP 21 is reasonable.  It specifies address, amount (decimal), and label.  It leave room for extra yet to be defined variables.  

BIPs are suppose to be discussed at length before calling for a formal vote.  I'd imagine the overly complex nature of Luke Jr URI BIP would of been called out by IRC, the mailing list and the like.

Based on a preponderance (more likely than not) of what I read so far; I'd say Luke Jr is a poisonous person.  However, having bad ideas is not a crime.  In fact all ideas, including bad ones, should be celebrated.  I'm sure there is more evidence both for and against this motion.This luke guy is the same guy who added religious text to the blockchain without his user's consent.The drama continues.Let's not forget that Luke Jr threatened to take SolidCoin founder to court if he wasn't given proper development credits in the source code. 

That sort of egotistic behavior will only hurt this project, not help it. Plus he is trying to challenge Gavin every step of the way here.I think Gavin is taking this way over the top at this point...Reading this thread and previous ones, I've came to a twist for the ELI5 meme.

2012-02-07 13:31:13;What's the best way to describe bitcoin to a non-computer user?;"So there's these smart guys, who made themselves some special gold. Very special gold, because all pieces can be identified differently.

In order to give them to someone the current owner has to write to a record who he wants the gold given to. This record is shared through the word of mouth. Because the current owner has to give permission to share the gold, this gold cannot be stolen or claimed easily(not even the government can do this), only if you have the owner's permission.

If one has a powerful computer at hand, they too can create gold.

Gold can only be created 50 at a time, 10 minutes each. And this number decreases all the time. So at one point you won't be able to create gold anymore.

People are free to offer what they want for other's gold; but because there is a limited supply the price is not 0.The block chain is a ledger that anyone can copy, stays synchronized between users, and is very difficult to forge. A transaction is an entry in the ledger transferring funds from one or more accounts to one or more accounts. All of this is done without a single point of failure.A picture is worth a thousand words and a video is made up of thousands of pictures.  The What Is Bitcoin video might give a script.
  http://WeUseCoins.com

In-person though you might wish to introduce it as it relates to the person you are describing it to.

If the person might be an investor, explain how it compares to gold (scarce, can store it yourself, unlike gold it is divisible into fractions).  If the person is computer illiterate perhaps they would grasp the concept being able to send and receive money using a mobile phone.

Here's one approach:

Using a couple Casascius physical bitcoins as props (one intact, and one ""spent"") helps to make it easier to explain Bitcoin.   The bitcoin address (public key printed on the hologram) is like a phone number that can be given out so others can send money to you.   The password (private key that is printed underneath the hologram) allows the holder of the coin to spend any funds received to that bitcoin address.

A paper bitcoin can be used instead (or in addition): http://www.bitaddress.org 

So then if bitcoin is just these two pieces of data, there is software that manages this data (an app on a mobile phone, for instance) to allow transactions to be sent and received by recording the transactions and showing balance information.

From there if the person might have further interest then conversation can begin regarding topics such as how issuance occurs or how exchanges allow you to buy or sell.1. **distributed** - a bunch of things spread all over

2. **peer-to-peer** - CB or ham radio. A bunch of people talk to one another. To reach someone really far away, you may ask someone to relay a message for you. This is in contradistinction to AM or FM radio where there is a centralized broadcasting system with a bunch of listeners. No one is in control of a peer-to-peer system and it is more resiliant - CB or Ham radio operators can join or leave and the system remains functional overall.

3. **cryptography** - the art of making messages secret. Decoder rings and simple letter substitutions can show the basics.

4. **hashes** - the buttons on a telephone associate letters to numbers. There are many possible words which will produce the same phone number, but given just the phone number, one can't know the original word.

5. **one-way-function** - it is easier to turn a 7 letter word into a phone number than it is to take a phone number and find a 7-letter word from it. It's also much easier to verify that a given name maps to a phone number, than to create a phone number which happens to map to a name.

6. **chaining** - there are stories online where each person writes one paragraph. If one builds off of something someone else wrote, they can't suddenly change the characters names or the plot or location without changing what the previous people wrote, otherwise the story won't make any sense.

7. **proof of work** - if you give me a 6-digit phone number and I ask for what person's name it represents and you tell me instantly, then I know that you either heard it from someone else or you figured it out ahead of time (or you're rain man). It's hard to create, but easy to verify (per one-way-function section). Now make that phone number 100 digits long and represent a historical quote. The chances of coming up with anything specific by chance (so long as it can be any historical quote, not just famous ones), is very low. Now, add a requirement that the phone number has to be divisible by some large prime - people have to look through their quote book and try a bunch of different quotes and throw most of them away. That's proof of work (well, inasmuch as it's a diminishing likelihood of luck).It's electronic money that you can't just copy.This is how I would explain Bitcoin to my mom in 10 seconds:

""You can think of Bitcoins as special e-mails that cannot be copied. When you forward the e-mail you lose your own copy of it. And because there's a hard limit on the amount of these special e-mails, people have started valuing them.""

Technically very inaccurate but it's easy to understand if you know e-mail and for the end user experience of Bitcoin it is not too inaccurate.Digital currency that takes the politics out of money.Don't forget to include the stone-money analogy. Stone money have been used by past societies. They were hard to generate but didn't have any inherent value.http://bitcoinmedia.com/bulleted-advantages/Imagine there's a computer program that stores what everyone in the world is buying and selling.  The program is as secure as anything that the CIA has ever used, and the best hackers in the world haven't been able to penetrate its security.  

Now, any time I send or receive money, the computer program records it.  The computer program is not running in any central place, it's spread out across an entire network, just like the internet.  No one can shut down this computer program, because doing so would mean shutting down hundreds of thousands of individual computers.

Because the money is stored in a computer program, I can send it from me to you as easily as sending an email.  I can literally 'email' you money, for no fee.  That means that Western Union, with their $7 per $100 dollar charge is out of business.  So is Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, at least the parts that do debits and not credits.  Gone, overnight.  

Because the currency is digital (computerized), I can break it into theoretically infinitely small pieces.  I can use it to buy real goods and services from anyone who accepts the currency.  The more people who accept it, the more value the currency has.  It's as simple as that:  it has value because people accept it.

The currency also cannot be counterfeited.  That security I mentioned before is so secure that it can't be cracked.  It's like a gold bar--you can't just make gold from nothing or from another material.  The same is true of bitcoin, it can't be made from anything else, except through the secure, unhackable computer program.This was one of my first ELI5s

http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j3ick/eli5_bitcoin_mining/Sometimes I describe it like cash, except if you accidentally lose it (by sending to a non-existent address or losing your key) then it can *never* be reprinted, by *anyone*. This seems to give it a mysterious quality to some people, lol.The way I would explain it as follows.

1. There is a public database out there that keeps track of how many bitcoins belong to which addresses.
1. You own addresses, and the bitcoins associated with it, by having the key (private key) to it.
1. People can transfer bitcoins to the addresses that you own, and you can transfer bitcoins to addresses other people own.
1. Bitcoins can be used directly by paying people who accept them, or by converting them to regular currency (and vice versa).[deleted]There is no such thing as a non-computer user.  Most people have phones which are simple computers, other people use vending machines, microwaves or other devices which are computers.  There are computers in shoes and clothing now, as well as in our credit cards, cars(possibly 1000s of computers) and TV.

Even luddite farmers who only own things made by hand and prior to the70's who don't use computers are going to be a thing of the past very soon now, and the developing world won't be far behind that."

2012-02-14 21:08:17;How do I... Do this?;"I am exhausted by people that keep trying to mine bitcoins with a single Nvidia GPU (Nvidia GPUs are horrible for mining).

Don't waste your time. You are going to make $20 in the whole year, spend hours of time doing it, all at the expense of someone else's $80 of electricity.

Your GPU will be noisy, and it will potentially die earlier.

---

But if you still really want to waste time and resources on this, then:

I see that your miner software is pointed at http://localhost:8332/, but it should be pointed at a pool address.

Try mtred.com, it's a decent bitcoin mining pool. Create an account at MtRed, then create a worker at MtRed, and MtRed will give you an address to point your miner at.Statistically speaking you will likely never discover a block mining solo (especially with an Nvidia). 

Join a pool then connect to it instead of localhost. If you want to use Eligius, you don't even need to create an account. Just use the following credentials:

* Username: 1HjuuBdTXvZTRSH1PYKamgUezLzzwL7KC6
* Password: x
* Server: mining.eligius.st
* Port: 8337

(Command line syntaxes are [here](http://eligius.st/wiki/index.php/Getting_Started)) 
Then check your mining stats in a webbrowser: [http://eligius.st/~artefact2/7/1HjuuBdTXvZTRSH1PYKamgUezLzzwL7KC6](http://eligius.st/~artefact2/7/1HjuuBdTXvZTRSH1PYKamgUezLzzwL7KC6)

If you created that address through bitcoins.de, you should perhaps create one with the local client instead.  I'm not sure if online wallets support mining directly to their deposit addresses.  In theory it sounds like that would work, but I've never tried.Maybe try 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost? Also do you have any parameters for the RPCusername and RPCpassword?

Also, have you downloaded the entire block chain yet? Generating addresses before then might be risky."

You could access the generated page from your browser, it would be exactly like any other page. I've been looking at this for a little while and in case anyone else is considering giving it a shot: you'll need to get the full html of the reddit page(the rss feed doesn't have the iframe links), then pull the iframes returned by all the www.redditmedia.com urls, then get the embeds from inside those iframes and figure out a way to get all those accessible to your javascript code. Then hopefully you send play commands to each in order. Most sharing sites have an autoplay that could abused with some sort of iframe reload. 

I've managed to extract an iframe and display it on a page but haven't gone into it further than that. This is a really cool idea so hopefully someone gets it done. For the scripting code, I'd be doing perl.

2012-02-21 23:53:30;What U.S. Regulations Apply to Bitcoins as Commodities?;"Value is a relationship between reasons for action or means and a state of affairs, it exists entirely in the mind. Bitcoin's value is people's perceptions of Bitcoin. As it relates to currency, it's a belief that others will accept it later. The Bitcoin system may have properties which help foster that belief and may indirectly be responsible for value, but ultimately value exists in the mind.

Any law related to the transmission of belief in what is valued, especially true belief, appears to be an infringement on the exchange of ideas. While perhaps legal, I'd argue it to be immoral.

Lastly, no regulations matter if one is not provably in possession of bitcoins.[Came across this while filing my taxes.](http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/8995/bitcointaxes.png) Mention of Bitcoin regulations?..."

2012-02-21 21:08:09;On mining. Is heavy investment required for fun?;"guiminer

there is also a GUI for cgminer which I suggest over guiminer

cgminer will allow you to use your computer and game with noticing it's mining6850 will do about 255mh/s - that's roughly 0.17 BTC in a full 24h.

With bitcoin being at about 4.30USD/BTC right now give or take, you'd be making the equivalent of about 73 cents per 24 hours a consistently full load is put on your GPU.  Then there's the power draw and cost from that.  It's fun to play poker with or whatever, and you can make gains, but long term that's a lot of stress on your system and you're almost guaranteed to come out with a loss over power consumption.

It would honestly be worth your time to do an hour's work for a friend/family member/anyone for 5-10 bucks and use that to purchase bitcoin, it would also help the community much more than mining at this point.There is a gui miner, i haven't used it.  Ill try to give you a real quick maybe some steps missing step up with Phoenix miner.  Hope you have windows, its all i have experience with mining.

1) go here https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=6458.0
scroll down until you see Download, click on Windows binaries and download.

2)extract it someplace, C:\Program Files\PMiner for example

3) sign up with a pool.

4)open the command line Start>>search or run cmd

5) change the directory to the folder your miner is in.  In this example type cd C:\Program Files\PMiner

6) start miner, pools provide the proper settings in some kind of help page, you basically just have to copy and paste what is there and put your username/password where it says toIf you're just looking to try it out, I would recommend eligius (a mining pool).  eligius.st has instructions; specifically http://eligius.st/wiki/index.php/Getting_Started.  Eligius in particular requires no registration, so all you have to do is install a miner (GUIMiner, https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=3878.0, if you want a GUI one) and point it at your bitcoin address.

Other mining pools have lower variance (because they're bigger), or differ in other ways, but being able to immediately start running is nice -- you can always switch pools later or set up individual mining if you like the variance.

Once you're running for a while (a couple of hours to a day or so) you can look at your progress using the tracking graphs (e.g. http://eligius.st/~artefact2/7/1M1hXXDjTQq6tMdtovpkSZZhsECrLw1cye) and see what your expected payout is."

2012-03-06 18:18:58;Bitcoiners sue Dwolla for $2 million;"Dwolla deserve this.

I'm still a Dwolla client, and I'd still happily accept it if any customers were willing to pay via it, but they do deserve it. What we've been told about the chargebacks insists that for some reason they thought it wouldn't be an issue with their account verification, and they therefore had absolutely no process to deal with chargebacks.

When I first signed up for Dwolla, I immediately thought it'd be great for hosting companies regardless of what happened with Bitcoin - the language was extremely attractive: something to the tune of ""never worry about chargebacks.""

Getting defrauded almost 6 digits is not ""never worrying about"" it. Arguably, this is *worse* than Paypal's model, because at least Paypal let you know up front that there's a chance you can get fucked.Not surprised. A while back there was a ""Walmart Money Card to Dwolla to MtGox"" method of converting cash into bitcoins and a very similar situation happened to me.

Already had a money card, so I figured I'd give it a try. Attempted to add 20$ to Dwolla, and it said Pending for about 3 days, Credited for a day, then got an email saying ""It never went through"" another day later, and another email from the MoneyCard service saying why it didn't go through. Long story short, I had 20$ in my Dwolla account that got reversed a day later for ""Never going through"". 

This was like.. 3 weeks ago. You'd think they would've learned by now. Hopefully this will force Dwolla to really deal with the chargeback issue more effectively. Chargebacks are a hard problem, and it may be the case that you can't have both fast from-bank deposits and chargeback-free transfers at the same time. If you claim you have both and it's not true, you deserve to be sued over it. I'm a big fan of Dwolla as a credit card / paypal replacement, but if they're dealing with money they have to actually be reliable.> The losses snowballed. Cash flow problems due to these losses caused TradeHill to shut down and lose some valuable domains including bitcoin.com.

Anyone have more info on this?The fact that they felt the need to update their TOS after the Tradehill thing happened probably means that there was a legitimate problem with them previously - I suspect TradeHill will win this one, although we'll have to see how the courts feel about it. 

If you read Dwolla's response to the claims, it primarily centers on the fact that 'chargebacks happen' - I don't think anyone is disputing that fact, just that Dwolla misrepresented the fact that they planned to pass those along to the seller. While I like Dwolla a million times more than Paypal, I think they screwed up here. They really should have just eaten the losses incurred up to the point where they changed their TOS - would have saved them a lot of problems.Do you think they'd take a settlement in Bitcoin?The free market works again!*sigh*

2012-03-20 15:33:33;Is Venmo a viable Bitcoin competitor?;"It looks more like the anti-bitcoin. You authenticate through FaceBook, transactions are centrally approved, and you see everything that your friends have transacted with each other. It's nice that payments between individuals are free (so far) but seriously, is it really important that I see that one of my friends bought a coffee for another one? These private companies have to pay rent, developers, power, hosting, and they must also offer fraud protection for their customers - all this and a profit. These services are reflected in the transaction fees which will be considerably higher than bitcoin. Bitcoin is just too cheap to compete with, especially when you have to offer fraud protection.It's just another centralized payment platform.. it'll probably be killed once the banks start allowing free online checking account transfers (or do they already?). Might possibly be useful for otc bitcoin trading? That's if it isn't trivially easy to charge back - which it probably is.No but maybe one day another avenue to buy and sell Bitcoin with. Like all centralized systems the company issuing them can be attacked both legally and with tom cruise missiles.**I don't want to use any money that depends on some ""company.""**

Furthermore I don't want to depend on a government either.

Does Venmo eliminate these problematic things?
These new payment systems are great, because they make also trading bitcoins easier. For example Dwolla helps with this.

After all, the inflation and high fees and costs of old payment systems are still there, and at some point people will realize that cryptocurrency offers much better benefits compared to these. Meanwhile, they will offer better ways to exchange fiat money to cryptocurrencies and vice versa.They claim that bank transfers happen over night - much faster than dwolla.


I really hope mt. gox or some other btc dealer starts accepting this service.

http://web.archive.org/web/20031008175805/orlingrabbe.com/dmt_guide.htm           
It supposedly had semi-anonymous, encrypted tokens, but used a central (corruptable) bank to clear the tokens.     
         
Any competitor to bitcoin would need to be separate from the credit card system and basically the banking system. Any alternative banking/currency system became (more) de-facto\* illegal after 911 in the US and via various international groups, most of the rest of the world.       
       
Any mobile payment processors are like the 'independent' ISPs that sprung up in the US because of the AT&T break up ruling that required AT&T baby bells to give last mile access to other businesses. Mobile payment processing is just icing riding on the current credit card system and can be put out of business by the banks/credit card companies raising fees or changing fee structures. Why there is some much manufactured excitment in the business press about mobile payment processing is a complete mystery to me - sure a few of these might succeed and then by absorbed and strangled (a la delicious/flickr, etc) by Visa or whoever but most are bs.

Also some people are long. > So I have to ask; what provision does the bitcoin network have in place to prevent an exchange from shorting both bitcoin and cash?

Nothing. Nothing at all.

How could it though? How can a currency prevent people from short selling it? Even centrally managed currencies like dollars and euros can't prevent this.

Also, why should we try to prevent this?If you notice there were a lot of coins ( http://bit.ly/HlAtVu ) and a fair amount of older coins ( http://bit.ly/HlAIzY ) traded right before the weekend.

The press barrage (reuters, businessinsider, gawker, siliconangle, betabeat, latimes, huffington post, forbes, etc, etc.)  began on Sunday.  The exchanges might not have known it was going to happen but that it was coming was likely not a secret to those in those media organizations, sometimes the date is known to those interviewed even, etc.

If there is trading on that knowledge, would that be considered ""insider trading""?  I don't know.  But if I held BTCs and figured the level of media coverage would be significant, I might move some BTCs to the exchange, just in case there is another 30% overnight jump up, for instance.  Worst case scenario, you don't sell and move them back out when the opportunity didn't present itself. 

There hasn't been enough volume on the exchanges to indicate to me that there is much of anything going on, so the pre-weekend movement of coin might be just a coincident that it happened right before the media barrage.  

Or that those coins moved is instead explained by moves from the exchanges to local wallets for safety because there is something else that might be in the hopper.  Who knows (well, those doing flow analysis on the blockchain probably have a better clue).  That's the joy of using an anonymous digital currency.

But as far as something stopping the exchanges from shorting -- there are regulations.  Mt. Gox has said they get audits and are under regulatory oversight in Japan.  So if they were to short using customer's segregated funds or were to trade on inside information that would be not only unethical but a risky financial move and potentially that would cause jail time.  So there are reasons why that probably isn't what is happening. The price has been steadily rising since the weekend.The price seems pretty high to me ATM.

2012-04-10 02:28:46;Can you please help fill me in on how Bitcoin works?;"> Its value is fixed on gold's value

à² _à² 

If you aren't trolling, have you checked out the wiki? There are loads of ""how bitcoin works"" articles plastered all over the internet.""*Its value is fixed on gold's value""


Not exactly! Bitcoin's value is not fixed on anything. You *can* buy gold on Coinabul.com with Bitcoin, but there is nothing to keep how much gold you get per BTC constant. The price of Bitcoin varies based on the demand for bitcoins.bitcoin's value is based on exchanges that match people up that are buying and selling. Just like any forex or stock market. 

you have a private key that is used to sign off your bitcoins to a hash of a public key (a bitcoin address).

The blockchain contains addresses, but it's more accurate to think of it as an accounting ledger that lists every transaction. basically, a from address, a to address and an amount. The blockchain does not contain every possible bitcoin address - only the ones used in transactions up to now. 

Bitcoin would not work without a blockchain.You buy about 5 Bitcoins and do absolutely nothing with them. Then you move from pipe dream to pipe dream. Maybe Iran will adopt Bitcoin, maybe it will be big in online gambling, maybe it will somehow play a role in digital distribution. After about 32 times you stop paying attention but hold on to your Bitcoins because...well maybe someday right? "

A lot of people that I introduce Bitcoin to are skeptical because they have never heard of it, it can sound like an underground scam, and it's a pie-in-the-sky ""cyber thing"" with no physical existence (which is a big deal for some people).

When I mention that it's been mentioned in the NY Times, Wired magazine, etc., that helps a lot. But handing them a physical magazine could do a lot to make Bitcoin physical and real, and take it immediately to a place in their mind where this is something that a lot of people are taking seriously -- so they can too.

This magazine is worth buying a few copies for that reason alone.I'm a little confused. I want to get a 12 month subscription, and while I don't want to miss the first issue, I don't have enough to buy the 12 month right now. Should I just buy 1 issue now, and then get the next issues later? (I'm not sure if, by doing that, I risk missing an issue or getting a duplicate).

2012-05-08 17:51:05;The Austrian School Theory to be Presented Before Congress: The Problems I See With Herbener's Presentation;"In addition to the reasons the author provides, I'd  argue that Bitcoin is better than gold because it's not already primarily in the hands of states, though that could change later of course.

It also doesn't depend on those who happen to own gold-rich land and mines which can cause supply problems and cartels. With Bitcoin pretty much anyone can buy a computer and either mine solo or join a pool - no one can prevent them like they could by refusing to sell a mine or mined gold.> Like the production of all other goods, production of money left to the market is regulated by profit and loss. Additional money is produced when demand for money increases or demand for other goods produced by the same resources decreases. If the demand for money increased, the value of gold coins would rise. Minting companies would increase production to capture the profit. As they increased the supply of certification service, its price would decline and as they increased their demands for resources to certify gold, resources prices would rise and the profit would dissipate. If demand for other goods declined, input prices would fall. Minting companies would increase production to capture the profit and, by doing so, eliminate profit from further production. In this way production of money in the market is socially optimal.

This is a really bad argument even if it's supporting something close to the right cause.

Imagine a parallel universe where the distribution of gold in the earth (and therefore the resultant supply curve) was such that a 1% rise in gold prices increased the gold supply by only a third as high a percentage as it does in our universe (ie. the supply curve is much closer to Bitcoin's vertical ideal). Everything else is the same. In such a universe, this same argument, if it were true, would apply and the supply of gold mined would be just as optimal. Therefore, we're left with a situation where in the two parallel universes the supposedly ""optimal"" supply of gold is different, even though all the social and economic factors that actually determine how good a given supply of gold is remain exactly the same.
You make a lot of good points in favor of Bitcoin, but I take issue with part of your argument. Specifically this: 

>Imagine if all the gold in the world was used to represent the value of all the material goods in the world. The current global supply of gold in existence is roughly ten billion ounces.  Those ten billion ounces would have to be divided up to represent trillions of âthingsâ.  The total dollar value of all assets in existence is in the quadrillions of dollars.  Exactly how much each ounce of gold would be worth if the entire world were to use gold as its primary money is hard to say, but it is safe to say that it would be enormous.

Why would the gold standard require that the gold in circulation be equal in value to all of the goods, services and assets in the world economy? What theory of money postulates that this would be or should be the case?

Regardless of your definition of money, or how your prefer to measure the total money supply in the United States; there is no economist alive, of any school, who would claim that it is equal to the value of all assets within the United States.

Under the gold exchange standard, which preceded the rise of the Federal Reserve, the supply of money redeemable for gold was far less than U.S. GDP. Banks practiced fractional reserve lending, and even then - the total value of all currency and bank deposits was never equal to the total value of all assets in the United States. And why should they be equal? Why should we assume that gold would be valued in those terms if it were returned to it's role as money? 

The Austrians don't argue that. They don't even agree on 100% reserve banking. Mises argued in favor of free banking (let the market decide optimal reserve levels) while Rothbard argued for 100% reserve. 

Your arguments in favor of Bitcoin over gold are generally strong. You do not need to resort to making straw man arguments. What will happen in a nutshell:

Herbener: Value is subjective and determined by the individual.

Congress: No, it's determined by us! How dare you say otherwise!The libertarian propaganda on this subreddit is annoying."

This is not the case with Bitcoin as it will continue to operate as a system to store and transfer value to another person - whether new people ""buy in"" or not.

It is the network effect of bitcoin that creates a demand for a limited resource that allows newcomers to make money, but only if they hoard their bitcoins and not use them as an actual currency.

Mining is essential to the security of the network, preventing double spends and inflating the currency into existence. Mining will *always* bare what the market demands. Too much computing power to mine and the difficulty goes up and not worth it... too little computing power to mine and the difficulty goes down and totally worth it. That it is inefficient probably goes more towards our shitty decisions regarding nuclear energy. A LFTR reactor would effectively dismantle any arguments against ""wasting electricity on mining"".People who call Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme, doesn't understand Ponzi Schemes.

This inflates the total value of the inputs, and with fees calculated as inputs - outputs, it inflates the fees as well.Should be fixed now. 

For those interested the problematic code was to do with the grouping of inputs with the same address (Line 25: http://pastebin.com/LhkMGxuB). When a duplicate address is found the value is added to the existing output and then discarded. The previous output was not being cloned thereby effecting the results of the none-distinct inputs.

Because it's a placebo. One day, you'll all get what you want, and that's how they're screwing you, by giving in one place while taking in another.

Now, Bitcoin actually has the potential to gain *some* leverage. Because it gets around the laws against local currencies by being a supranational currency. Perfect example of how change is achieved best by operating outside of governmental constraints.too bad you're anonymous"

2012-06-05 21:34:02;Why is copying the wallet.dat not enough?;"Addresses are continually being generated within the wallet due to ""change"" transactions. If new addresses are generated without a backup, you stand a significant chance of losing Bitcoins. In QT the addresses are pregenerated 100 at a time if I recall, so you need to backup your wallet file at least every 100 transactions (IIRC).

Another thing you might try is the 'rescan' option.That second wallet file (wallet.dat is the only only one that is used) is likely a leftover from when you encrypted your wallet.  

Starting clean, you only need in your bitcoin folder:

  - wallet.com
  - blk0001.dat
  - blkindex.dat

Launch bitcoin-qt (or bitcoin/bitcoind for 0.4.x) and go.If Bitcoin wasn't shut down cleanly before you saved the wallet, the wallet's database log files might also be required.The other two files have the blockchain in them.  You could NOT have those, but then you'd have to wait for the entire chain to redownload."

Miners could refuse to process transactions if they don't profit from them, leading to fees adjusting depending of supply and demand.

Of course I have the coice between many parties for that I can vote (I think that voting system is better than in America) but at the end I only can vote who lies on me. It is a fake democracy because people in big parties are lobby guys and if you want to join a party and are saying the truth you can do it only once. That is how it works. 

If we are not changing the system these days we will never have such a good chance in history again I think. They are not stupid. They recognized the danger of freedom and internet. That is the reason why they want to introduce new internet censor methods around the world.

2012-06-12 22:32:32;If we could do it over again . . .;"Mt. Gox should have been named something less stupid.I think bitcoin is perfect. It's proven to be secure and exstensible thus far. I think Bitcoin's properties for inflation, transaction fees, and ultimate deflation need to be play out by society.. the world has never seen anything like it and as such it may once and forever prove who was right: Keynes or Hayek.I don't think it was something Bitcoin did wrong but bitcoin would probably be in a much better position if these things had been done. GPU mining and pooled mining sideswiped many people early on (public versions of GPU based miners only emerged 3-4 months after some privately developed versions appeared), initially alot of people were at an unfair level when it came to mining, and pools complicated things by making centralised points of failure that could (and did) get attacked and exploited. 

Also the early startups were hopelessly insecure, or were outright scams. It's sickening to see how much damage scammers did to the Bitcoin name, as well as the hopeless security measures some of the more popular sites used (and still do, Bitcoinica being a fine example of dumbassery). 

To sum up, GPU mining should have been integrated and shared much faster to level the playing field, p2pool likewise should have been brought to the masses sooner to reduce the fragility pools introduced. And ffs, all the Bitcoin startups should have made site security their TOP priority. Bitcoin would have been a much rosier place if these things had been better handled.[deleted]- Make [Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) Turing-complete. This would allow many major changes to be done in the future without requiring everyone to upgrade. Even most of the crypto could be upgraded later.
   - This would allow Bitcoin to use a faster signing algorithm. ECDSA is too slow.
   - For hashing that can't be upgraded through a Turing-complete Script system (block hashes, for example), use several of the best-known hash algorithms concatenated instead of just SHA-256.
- gmaxwell has proposed adding data about every unspent output to blocks in order to allow peers to more safely verify transactions without the full chain.
- The coinbase data area is hard-limited to 100 bytes, which now seems too small.
- Expand the maximum BTC precision from 8 decimals.The immense computational power behind mining is going to waste. If there was some way to apply this computational effort toward problems then the work would not be wasted, and in fact could generate value. People could submit problems to the network with a reward, where problems are given priority based on how much you offer to reward.the Ripple ideas of credit/trust extension and revocation, as well as value transfers, all implemented in a block chain style like Bitcoin for a pure mutual credit system. That is the bitcoin killer. But we dont need it for another 40 years. Bitcoin will evolve and in 17 years nation states will all crumble as they are unable to justify their own existence any longer. The bizarre global civilization that will arise out of this will operate well with Bitcoin and only after the freedoms and benefits of a bitcoin based money society are fully realized will there ever be critical mass enough to take it to that whole nother level and do the pure mutual credit thing. So .. yeah in 40 years :D :D :DThere are some suggestions from a similar question on the Bitcoin StackExchange:

  - http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1086I think that the mining rewards should drop with every mined block using a logarithmic function, rather than having a steep cliff every few years. This would make planning easier, and it would show the results of the reducing block reward much sooner. Instead, there will be some weirdness in the months leading up to December when it halves, people hoarding coins, maybe some people coming online for one last go at hashing and pushing the difficulty up. It's hard to say.

Then, on the other side, I would make some transaction fees mandatory and based on the gap in the mining reward from 50 btc time the size of your transaction divided by the total transactions in the last block, up to a certain percent (maybe 1%) to prevent a weird block with small transactions from messing it up. I might be proven to be wrong about needing this, but it's something I think about.Instant transactions would be nice, rather than having the lengthy validation period.

But I have no clue how that could be implemented while also keeping it secure and peer-distributed.* I don't think the amount of mining fees are going to make sense.    When 1BTC is worth a million dollars USD, how many BTC/kb are going to be transaction fees?

Something's got to give.  The default mining rewards should be much, much lower.  It's mostly a client issue, though.

* There is a problem of pruning old transactions.  I think this should be just as predictable as the generation of new coins.  If you're still interested in keeping the transaction around, there should be something in the script for that transaction that says so perhaps.   After 21 million coins are created perhaps we could start to see the coins start to disappear at a linear, random rate unless spent, and then regenerated.  In the long run this problem is going to hurt, imho.I think it required more early promotion. Too many coins were mined before anyone had even heard of it (and I mean even the bleeding edge community on Slashdot).The only thing I would change is how the block reward decreases. Halving it might be too abrupt. It would have been better a more smooth transition. That said hopefully the people anticipates the changes and it does not affect too much.

For the rest, I think its perfect.I don't think the gradually decreasing mining reward was necessary or even useful. Economies generally grow exponentially; if Bitcoin were doing so badly that its growth was sub-linear, it would have bigger problems than price increases.The main failing of BitCoin is that its value can bubble, and thus also crash hard.  If we were to start over, a better approach would be to create a mechanism that would flood the market as the value increases, but also decrease the currency expansion as the value decreased.  

The one proposed method of accomplishing this would be to tie the number of coins created to the hash difficulty.  Thus as the value increases, people spend more for electricity to create more coins and thus pushes the difficulty up.  There are two downsides to this, however.  

First, such a method would consume more energy than the standard BitCoin method.  When I do a rough calculation of the amount of currency in the world, it would take one to two years worth of electricity to create the equivalent value in digital coins.  With the earth already overpopulated and energy resources already tight, such a currency would cause more problems.

Second, technological advances would cause problems with inflation and more energy consumption.  This would happen because it would become cheaper to create new coins, and thus more energy would be spend to create new coins, as well as causing inflation in the money supply (when demand for such a currency is flat)."

2012-06-19 17:08:59;Bitcoin Credit Union?;"Well this is in the works:
http://www.bitcoinstarter.com/http://www.kiva.org/ in bitcoin?


essentially, the current lending model is quite broken.

its always: rich entity (bank) with lots of money loans one chunk of money to poor guy who needs it.

when a person wants to deposit money he must do so at the rich entity which gives him a petty return.

IMO, it should be like

if i want to invest money i give it to 20-100 individuals who each pay me a modest intrest. 5% of them will eventually be unable to repay fully, and have to declare bankruptcy.


from a lenders perspective, i borrow from lots of people. this should mean the incentive to repay since i would disappoint lots of people - this would damage my future reputation.

so in essence this models more ""village community"" then what we have now. of course we need a mediator who can 

 * ensure the identity of the borrower
 * keep track of payments and repayments
 * has a legal representation so he can try to collect missing money in case of default
 * due to technology this should be done with minimal overhead
 * should be a not-for-profit organisation which has very clear financing (this should be trivial to set up due to the way bitcoin works)
Also, [Bitcoin Credit Beauro](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=86984.0)yeah what happened to that Bitcoin Credit Union? I remember 'investing' one bitcoin in it about a year ago.Will never work! Bitcoin people cannot have reputation as identity is not permanent, i.e. your identity can without high cost be thrown away and recreated. This makes ratings useless (as they are in the US where you can just walk away and restart, even to another state) Also, there needs to be a arbitration and enforcement for non payment. How do you force someone to pay bitcoin when it is impossible to known than anyone even has bitcoins? In principle all this could be all be added to the risk side of things, but this then leads to 20-30% interest due to all the scammers this will attract.

Anyone investing in kickstarter type ventures with bitcoin should expect many projects to be scams. So something just like Prosper.Com. For BitCoins instead.
Prosper.Com also has people ""borrowing"" money and not paying it back. So, those borrowers automatically goto a collection agency to get the funds back. Can't do that with BitCoins, unless you ALSO start a collection agency for this too. But then to be labeled a ""collection agency"", we would have to conform to the rules setup for it. 
 That could be a big problem..The ""lendee"" should not be anonymous. Just an idea.So Lendingclub.com in bitcoin?when I signed up for my credit union account, it was because it was a small branch.  Individual tellers I could get to know by name.  They had coffee brewing for me when I came down to chat with them. They tended to have off hours I could drop by.  There was effectively no such thing as identity theft that would be even possible because everything was done 
a) on camera
b) on paper
c) in contact with someone who you recognized as a human being and more often than not friend

Today I interface with that same credit union primarily through their website and ATMs because they are *effectively never open*.  They change their increasingly draconian EULA seemingly monthly and their IT security policy is very bad.   I have been trying to buy a government bond or something for close to a year and a half to no avail.  They wouldn't know me from a hole in the wall and would trust someone else saying they were me in a heartbeat.

None of these things* precludes them from accepting terms denominated in bitcoin or even lending out my money to invest in local businesses and *gasp* government, even.  As far as I'm concerned, although it's always tempting to centralize, cutting costs and increasing profits, credit unions are an inherently good thing, and the tradeoff of security versus being a *part of a community* is worth it, if you can keep them from being robbed or worse, growing too big.

*(except the government bond part, really)"

2012-06-19 14:31:27;Scott Aaronson: Quantum Money from Hidden Subspaces;"**Abstract:**
>Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1) public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a ""classical"" hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. 

>Our scheme is based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the ""black-box"" version of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative to a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). 

>Even in Wiesner's original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in Wiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. 

>Our money scheme is simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based scheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. 

>Our security proofs use a new variant of Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and several other tools that might be of independent interest.

Speculation is good, it tests the waters of what Bitcoins are really worth, any chump that risks more than they are willing to lose are asking for it.

I love to upvote Bitcoin articles and share the love, but my brain hurts trying to read this.Why can't I hold all this Kool-Aid?Bitcoin is good. I support it. But it's extremely unstable.I give this article an F for effort. Ok... F+ because it is about bitcoin. Just so we're clear I'm not being sarcastic when I say this. I love the healthy skepticism in r/bitcoin. People seriously need to stop conflating the state of Bitcoin value, it is what it is, and frankly what it is RIGHT NOW is frigging fantastic, It's value doesn't need to inflate to the moon, it is useful in so many ways right now, and that is seriously enough for people to effuse about on it's own.

Everyone that promotes the value of Bitcoin going up is just in it for a quick buck. Any person that reads this needs to be level headed, Bitcoin is NOT a stock, and frankly Bitcoin is incredibly volatile, even now. Your odds on a return are better at a casino, seriously.

tldr; This link is mindless propaganda to drive up the price, fuck people that do this.If you look at how much the value of Bitcoin has fluctuated against national currencies in the last 12 months, you will see that Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. 

There are a lot of finance guys who are trying to game Bitcoin as a hobby, and the swings in value are going to get a lot bigger."

We can do this all day long.I was very curious, so I typed into a spreadsheet every single trade from the downtick from 7.25 to when it stopped. I might have transcribed a few wrong here or there, but basically it came to 5032.4940 or close to 5000 btc (the extra you could count as someone else selling at the time). You can also see a 10,000 btc sell pop up at 7.10 after which seems to be the same person.

It does appear to me to be someone doing a market sale of 5,000 bitcoin, but it's hard to say. They might have done a limit sale of 7.00, but it actually doesn't get to 7.00, there's still an ask of about 136 btc at 7.0001 when the trade finishes.Haha, I was watching this on the clarkmoody site earlier today and as the plunge started wishing I had it recorded.

2012-07-10 19:31:15;Should I buy some bitcoins now or later?;"Are you looking for bitcoin as an investment, or for use in commerce.

If it is or commerce, then it really doesn't matter what the future exchange rate is because once you transfer the funds to pay for your purchase, you no longer are exposed to the exchange rate risk.

If you know you will need bitcoins at some point in the future, you can speculate on the price going up and purchase them now.   Thus you benefit if the exchange rate does go up.
If you're looking to invest in anything that is volatilte you should learn about dollar cost averaging. Basically figure out how much you want to invest for the year, break it into monthly or weekly chunks and buy monthly or weekly accordingly.Nobody can predict the exchange rate... If you can predict the movements, just take really big loan, speculate, and become a millionaire. If anyone actually knew where the price was going in the short term, they wouldn't be in r/bitcoin, they'd be buying or selling as much as they could.It depends on your outlook and expectations.. If you would like to play around, learn something new, and possibly buy something with them, then certainly!

If you're trying to make a quick profit on the upswing here and are only short sighted... then use extreme caution.

If you understand bitcoin, see the potential benefits to society, and have some excitement, and time to watch some expendable money potentially grow to ridiculous value, then perhaps you can feel a little more comfortable throwing a little more dough at it..

But if you do throw *any* money at it, then please try and spend some of it.sorry I'm new in reddit too, not sure why there's nsfw tag on my post lolThere's a pretty strong uptrend right now that appears to be on its second leg. Buy on a pullback day which consequently looks like will happen today.We're on the 9th consecutive week of being in the green, chances are we'll get a correction to the mid $6s or even to upper mid $5s, get your money on to Gox & leave some bid orders near to either or both of those prices ranges if I was you.
http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#igWeeklyztgSzm1g10zm2g25zvNo harm in buying Bitcoins now in my opinion but you take the risk although the value has been stable and increasing for the past few months so the risk might just be lowIts hard to tell, but bitcoin has been on a pretty steady up-swing for the last month and it doesn't look like its slowing down yet.  consensus is that its going to go to at least 8 before any serious consolidation strikes.  

If it were me, I'd try and get in now rather than waiting."

The general story of Bitcoin is quite positive from a social perspective, but anything also useful to 'bad' people can itself become entangled in the 'badness' of their actions.  

Almost certainly 'fighting money laundering' will be near the top of the Government's moral justification for whatever actions they decide to take to fight Bitcoin.  It therefore becomes incumbent upon those of us who are pro-Bitcoin to answer those charges head-on.

What are the best arguments currently to fight the accusation that Bitcoin should be banned because it facilitates money laundering?I think it will push down on the price a little as drug dealers and terrorists will realise that they don't need bitcoin for laundering and instead can just work with big banks.

Right? Because that would make it harder to do it (again) successfully.

But pirateat40 has another business quite apart from this alleged market manipulation -- he runs a High Yield Investment Program Â¹ called ""Bitcoin Savings and Trust"". I've read that it offers 7% per month interest. A HYIP is a kind of Ponzi scheme, in which earlier subscribers are paid by taking the investment from later subscribers. Those require a continually increasing rate of new subscribers to stay in operation.

If you're looking to attract attention from people in order to get them to subscribe to your scheme, it would make sense to publicly claim credit for moving the market, whether or not you actually had anything to do with it.

Â¹ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yield_investment_programWell pirate is saying he is controlling the market. From what I understand it sounds like he puts in a large order and buys all coins from 8-8.5 which causes everybody else to panic buy making it go up to 9.5. Then he sells them all for 8.5 which causes panic selling and he makes money. Not sure if that's correct or not.> Could someone throw out a quick explanation for us new people? This sort of thing makes bitcoin seem very bad.

It seems someone has, at least partially, cornered the Bitcoin market on Mt. Gox [1]. Now bear in mind, this is possible for anyone to do currently with a relatively low amount of money. Bitcoin is a pretty small economy. As Bitcoin grows this will be harder and harder to do.

In the 1950s two guys successfully cornered the onion futures market [2]. In other words, someone cornering a market doesn't mean the traded commodity has failed, it just means it has sufficiently low value for someone to enter into it and buy up enough of the assets to control it to a certain degree. Saying that Bitcoin has failed because someone has cornered the market is a bit like saying onions have failed because someone succeeded in cornering the onion futures market.

2012-07-17 17:05:22;My phone was stolen and it had 50 BTC on it.;"Fokes! We are all sorry for matthews loss, but glad it wasn't any astronomical sums. 

Let's take this as a reminder to encrypt and backup. Repeat after me, ***encrypt*** and ***backup***. When you say the BTC was ""on"" your phone, do you mean that your only copy of the wallet was on the phone?

Do you have the identifier and password for the blockchain.info account?Did you ever use the website version of blockchain.info? If so, and you have it bookmarked, you can access them there. Did you set up email account associated with your wallet? If so, you should have gotten email backups of your wallet. As a last resort, you could try contacting the owner of blockchain.info (Ben Reeves) and see if he can help you retrieve the copy of the wallet stored on the blockchain server (which you can decrypt with your password).> I should have just kept them on my computer.

That's not necessary. You can use the blockchain app's email backup service to recover your coins (next time) in an event like this.

The emailed wallet they send you is encrypted, so you'd just need your password to recover your coins.Access to Blockchain.info/wallet can occur from any device, whether that is a phone or web browser.

The problem is that it appears you didn't associate an alias with the wallet, you never associated your e-mail address with the wallet, and you never requested an archive which would contain an encrypted backup of the wallet and the private keys.

Fortunately, all is not lost.

If you get in contact with Blockchain.info (use the ""Contact support"") and explain the situation, they can send to you a link with the identifier for your wallet.  From there, you simply login using your password.

Then done, you'll have regained access to your wallet and to your coins.

But then ... be smart.  Set an alias.  Associate your e-mail address to it.   Request that it send you a backup (to your inbox)Just to follow up on this: I was able to find Matthew's wallet identifier from his email but unfortunately it is unaccessible without the password.

It is likely the thief doesn't know what bitcoins are since they haven't move yet so Matthew's best bet is probably to try and SMS his old phone and offer the thief a reward for it's return.

Always remember your password!Isnt there a program that will show you the geographical location of your phone when its turned on?yeah, sign into them on their website, assuming you configured your phone with the same wallet.  alternatively... root and titanium backup.??Sounds like you came out ok (other than your phone getting stolen). If you haven't already, don't forget to transfer all your coins to a new wallet. How/where was it stolen btw?Your phone *is* a computer."
2012-07-24 19:05:06;Just posting to share my excitement in setting up my first bitcoin-handling web server.;"Check out Electrum Stratum and what people are starting to do with seedless wallets and transaction processing. It could replace 3rd party payment processors all together.Now please take a break and look at the security side of things. I am not a developer but if you are working with private keys just realize that you are playing with real value storage. Just a little heads up..:)Stop using PHP. It has all kinds of hidden traps/pitfalls that will eventually lead your site into having security flaws, resulting in the loss of any Bitcoins being handled by your server.
Linux rules, json is good, php *can* be good. Seems like secure development is going the way of python and ruby though, so you may want to look into that. You may want to think about user logins / sessions, for commercial applications you will likely need that. You could check out penetration testing tools, I highly recommend that if you are taking a webserver live with php code...Python (http://python.org) and the web framework for it, django (https://www.djangoproject.com/) are a better development path than php, in my estimation. There are other python web frameworks, too, but django seems to be gaining the most traction."

2012-07-31 20:20:21;Bitcoin difficulty rising/price increase or decrease;"You are asking for opinions about two unknowns:  What will the exchange rate be in the future.  How many ASICs will ship and when?

Nobody knows.  (Well, employees of BFL might have a clue as to how many ASICs and when, but they aren't going to spill that here on Reddit.)The first 2000 blocks after shipment will go by very fast. We will experience new blocks probably every couple minutes until the difficulty recalculates. It will actually take about 8000 blocks to fully adjust from an initial change. But I imagine the new asic miners will be spread out over 2 months starting in october, so the hashrate/difficulty will rapidly change initially and continue a steady climb from there.I wonder this too. I could probably save up enough bitcoins from some moderate GPU mining to preorder one of the Jalapeno asic miners, but I wonder if it would be worth it. I also wonder how well they're going to be able to fill preorders. I'd be very disappointed if a month from now I spent all the btc I have to preorder then don't get one until early next year.

Lately I've mostly just been using my moderate btc earnings to get Amazon gift cards to buy some smaller things I want. If investing in some asic hardware would be beneficial and not take forever to recover my initial investment then I'd be interested. I'd feel a little sick though If I bought specialty hardware that would be virtually useless (for other tasks) if the difficulty skyrocketed so much that I'm barely making anything from mining. Buying graphics cards didn't bother me as much because I could use them for gaming or resell them easily. I don't think the same could be said for the Jalapeno or other asic hardware.Logically the price shouldn't change when the reward halves.  It should increase, except that because we know that it should increase people will buy in advance of the increase in an attempt to make a profit.  So instead of a sudden jump there should be a gradual transition.

Of course herd dynamics and scams play a huge role in the bitcoin price, so we can't really say for sure what will happen, when it will happen, or how much.Well, supposedly it adjusts I believe, so if we normally mine 40 blocks a week on average, and one week 400 blocks are mined, the difficultly will shoot up to bring the average back to 40 blocks, or whatever it's supposed to be.  Supposedly around December the amount of blocks issued will be halved.

2012-07-31 19:49:51;Noob here.  Just a quick question about transaction fees and the quickness of transactions/transfers/withdrawals/etc.;"> I even checked that address on blockchain.info only to receive this message: ""No transactions found for this address, it has probably not been used on the network yet.""

Then bitfloor didn't sent it yet. When they make the transaction, you will immediately see it in your wallet, *even before it confirms*. It might show 0 confirmations at first, but it should show up. In the meantime, you can make a different test transaction to yourself from one of the faucets.

I'd also recommend setting a transaction fee. It's very tiny anyway.
There is no fee to receive bitcoin. So setting the fee in electrum will not affect this specific transaction. But you should set it to a minimum of .001 for future transactions you create from your electrum wallet. This has the ability to save hours of pain and costs almost nothing.

I think the thing you might be waiting on is Bitfloor actually releasing the funds even though the interface says it's complete. It looks like it's been an hour already by the time of your post, but I'd send support a email in another hour or so if you dont see anything.

If you want, you can look up your electrum address in the blockchain (at blockchain.info) and see if any bitcoins have been sent to it yet.At least it was only 9 bitcents.  It might eventually go though, but I'm not really sure.Just edited my original post with an update describing a successful outcome.  Rock on Bitfloor, and rock on Bitcoin!!!"

2012-08-07 16:41:42;Bernard von NotHaus ran the most successful alternative currency in the country ... Was it really counterfeiting? (X/post from r/foodforthought);"This is definitely a case of the government stretching the law to get rid of something they simply don't like rather a genuine breaking of the law. 

If you read the indictments, it hinged on the fact the coins and certificates  used terms and imagery similar to those used on US coins and bills (liberty, the flame from the statue of liberty, in god we trust, dollar, etc). If Von NotHaus hadn't use those he would have likely been able beat the case. 

Luckily bitcoin isn't subject to counterfeiting laws.Anyone using liberty dollar was very aware that it was not american dollars.  If you're going to counterfeit government money, why the fuck would you make your coins out of something worth many times more than the thing you're counterfeiting?

Either these were the stupidest counterfeiters in all of history, or they were not counterfeiting.Terrible situation ... all those people thought they had bought silver but only ended up with a slip of paper and a claim against an asset confiscated and still being held by the feds in a Dallas vault,

Here are the only two possible outcomes of your action:      
1 - They never answer.      
2 - They find some way to say btc = bad people.     
      
Before you go asking the alligator what it eats, study what happened to e-gold - e-gold wasn't money, right? But they killed that. I don't know how you could possibly expect a positive result from this except if you had no knowledge of those groups, their goals and their motivations.     
       
Just say no btc for your organizations and move on. Money from semi-anonymous poor people and elections don't mix, semi-anonymous money from rich people and shady sources are A-OK via the super PAC laws.       
       
I assume this will be downvoted by people who think that somehow magically they'll say ""Sure, fine carry on"" but past track record, goals and similar cases are against that happening.   I wonder if FinCEN were to say that money transmitter registration was required.   Could they accommodate thousands of new money transmitter registrations.

Here's one method those in the U.S. might be able to use to buy bitcoins using credit card.

There is a new money transfer service called Remitly.   They let you send funds, with the transaction funded by a credit card, to the Philippines -- via the GCash network.  This is primarily intended to be for remittance payments to the Philippines.

There is an exchange in the Philippines that performs exchange to and from bitcoins, and accepts GCash payments for the purchase of bitcoins.

So, ... to use Remitly, the send money form will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and last four digits of SSN.  

The Philippine exchange:

This method hasn't yet been attempted so if anyone does try it, feel free to share the results.
Curious, but why would you have all your money on your Paypal account? If you're in some sort of business online I'd think the risk of them freezing it would scare you to withdraw some...It probably depends on how much money you're talking about.

Most people are wary of accepting Paypal and transferring BTC because Paypal is known for reversing transactions days/weeks/months after they happen, but the BTC transfer is effectively instantaneous and irreversible. So the person you're trading with is taking a risk that you'll accept the BTC, then tell Paypal that your account was hacked or your credit card was stolen or whatever, and then the person loses the Paypal funds and the BTC.
https://www.bitcoinary.com you can contact people who are willing to exchange paypal for bitcoin.Do this instead:

> Create an account at mtgox.com

> go to ""Funding Options""

> select ""Cash deposit via Bitinstant"" from menu

> Print transaction slip, bring it to bank and deposit amount

> Buy bitcoins at mtgox.com

I used this method the other day. It works dandily.

I have paper wallets, but I always keep a secondary copy of those keys in an encrypted text file, just in case. I carry wallets on a credit-card CD in my real wallet, but I also have copies of them on my computers.
Would anyone be nice enough to write a brief tutorial highlighting how to keep coins offline in a safe but convenient to access way?Electrum brain wallets and the secret split x ways where a family member, friend, and lawyer get thier own piece of the secret.Of course (:  I use a number of methods, from Satoshi client wallets on a flash drive in a safe, to stored value coins like the Casascius coins, to using the Armory client in off-line mode.

I keep all my bitcoins between my butt cheeks.I just encrypt my wallet, put it on 3 separate USBs, in 3 different locations, and then delete the wallet from the computer.  It's really easy to get the wallet back and spend the coins, and it's just as much disconnected from everything as a brain or paper wallet without any of the hassle.  Plus I don't have to learn anything in order to do that.  At least that's the way I see it.  All that other work just doesn't seem necessary.

The talk about the ""threat"" posed by bitcoin, or just decentralised currency, there being a risk to taxation (*we* know it will never replace nation states currencies) was very interesting. I had never thought of that as a reason why the *Man* would attack the currency.

But with the talk of the banks being more exposed to collapse, the prospect of the ""death and taxes"" adage being halved to merely; ""death"" is quite an interesting one.

Does that sum up Anarcho-capitalism? The elimination of taxes would be the ultimate capitalist social structure, with no free education, medicine, etc... and the decentralised nature of the currency being the anarchic element..."

I wouldn't pay a dime to these morons who invested in it. They are as much as guilty as this pirate. Their punishment should be loss of that capital. Dump assholes... then they have audacity to whine over it. All of them knew exactly what they were doing, but they were blinded by greed. 

But, pirate also needs an punishment for operating this. This matter should go to police. And by the way, he operated in MtGox and there are pretty good security measures, he will be identified and funds frozen if MtGox is notified (by police). 

Of course if he used fake ID, and so forth (in MtGox), it will become harder, but somehow he still has to cash in. Probably he made those 100K dumps, so there is a trace. At least a place to start.Haha, that pirate guy was such a con. So obvious from the beginning.

LOLIntangible things certainly have value. Try downloading an illegally copied video from a torrent site and see how fast the police kill your dog on their way to kick your door in.SEC violations. 

Its illegal to promote, sell, or otherwise arrange investment without some specific legal licenses (broker, investment adviser, etc). 

Moreover, even completely private non-promoted investments are subject to strict criteria (ie. vetted qualified investors, private placement documentation, etc). 
It depends. If he truly were trading and had profits each week, but is having trouble shutting down ... ""unraveling', then there probably was no crime.

The likely scenario (by a very, very wide margin) is that this was no trading or other revenue-generating activity occurring and instead this was siimple fraud by deception.

There was probably conspiracy with others (you know who you are).  RICO might even apply as well.  But Ponzi operators don't usually get charged with that apparently, looking at the list of Ponzies in the news:

 - http://theponzibook.blogspot.com/2012/07/july-2012-ponzi-scheme-roundup.htmlWell, if I discussed doing computer work with somebody online (discussions reliably documented), and gave them the credentials to my colocated server as prescribed, and they logged in and copied off all of my data for their own purposes and then wiped my hard drive.. then nothing physical has transpired but many laws exist on the books to punish this behavior. Interstate Fraud, computer hacking, breech of contract, you name it.

It doesn't matter if the login technology changes, or my computer isn't a computer at all but a ""cloud instance"" running on thousands of Amazon EC2 servers, but I gave him a credential to an asset of mine. I can prove that the credential was unique and non-reproducible. I can prove he was in receipt of that credential, and then that credential was used to deny my further access to the asset (bitcoin principal) let alone the agreed upon service (bitcoin interest).

Bitcoin markets even allow me an easily demonstrable value for the asset to assess damages.

Because Bitcoin is at it's heart the most bad-ass notary system the world has yet seen, I think the first clear legal case defending the currency/commodity/asset will prove to be a slam dunk.Securities fraud, unlicensed financial derivatives exchange. It would be a federal case.The law is pretty clear about this sort of thing. If you have something of value (bitcoins do have value) and then they disappear when they weren't supposed to, the law has something to say about itt. Just because the medium of transaction has changed doesn't mean the law will just surrender. It may be helpful to just think of bitcoin as a foreign currency. If I make a contract to invest my swiss francs in the US and the money disappears then I can still sue and recover. 

Some crimes off the top of my head in the US:

* Theft/Fraud for the disappearance of the bitcoins.
* Operating without SEC license for investment vehicle or banking charter. This will depend on how the courts think he should be classified as (bank or investment). 

He is also liable for the missing bitcoins under tort law (civil not criminal). It would be for the tort of conversion.Nothing would happen. It's like taking someone's WoW gold but without the admins to ban you from the game."

Seems cool, but how does this compare with [Rugatu](http://www.rugatu.com/)?This is probably the wasteland it is because there are tons of users already on sites/networks like StackExchange and Quora who will answer these kinds of questions for free.

Full disclosure: I'm one of the Bitcoin StackExchange moderators so I'm probably biased and this probably sounds spammy, but I still think a paid Q&A site is a niche market we don't really need.I really like the idea, most question sites I find have many unanswered or poor answers.

2012-09-04 22:13:18;"Noob question:  Is there a way to identify which bitcoins were stolen and put them on a ""blacklist"" so people can choose never to accept them in transactions?";"In order for that to work, you would have to somehow get 95%+ of the population to suddenly agree on a single database of stolen coins - if you don't, everyone who signs up for your system will simply be inconveniencing themselves as those who hold stolen coins can keep trying to use them until someone accepts. And if you do succeed, you've basically created a centralized authority over Bitcoin, and we're almost right back where we were with the banking system and Paypal.There is no way this can be done without negatively impacting innocent people.  If I accept payment from the thief and didn't know they were stolen, but then I cannot spend them because they are blacklisted, then I am harmed.

A response to that is that I should have referred to the blacklist before accepting them and that is an additional layer on top of bitcoin that I don't wish to have.  Especially since there is no real way to prove who is the rightful owner of the coins.

i.e., tainting bitcoins is an unworkable solution.No. Btcoins are fungible.Part of the problem with that is that there are no descrete coins as such, just balances. 

If you pay some tainted balance and some untainted balance to an address and then make many payments out of that there's no way you can say which end payment contains the tainted balance because it's all just mixed together.

You could say that all of the outbound payments are 'tainted' by some tiny amount proportional to the tainted input coins but that doesn't really mean much.

Now there's also the problem of the blacklist - who maintains it? How do you know whether or not the person submiting the blacklisting request isn't just lying in order to blacklist someone else's coins? How do you stop a thief colluding with the maintainer to keep their stolen coins off the list. These are not really solvable problems etiher.

If some merchant or exchange starts arbitrarily freezing people's coins claiming they were 'tainted' I think people will just stop using that exchange or merchant.The mechanics of Bitcoin are designed to make this technologically and morally infeasible. If you combine a stolen coin with a mined coin into a single 2 coin script, are those two coins half stolen? It's better just to realize that Bitcoin does not and will not care about transitory human laws or morals. Trace amounts of cocaine can be detected on 4 out of 5 [American notes](http://www.snopes.com/business/money/cocaine.asp). Does that mean we should start sweeping money for coke before we accept them? If you can be satisfied with the answer to this question than I think you know how we should handle stolen Bitcoins.

It is very unfortunate that some Bitcoins will end up being proceeds of crime, and efforts should be made to determine the origins of stolen coins in order to find the suspects (and lets be honest, if criminals steal coins or use Bitcoins for illegal activities, unless they are 100% vigilant in thoroughly laundering their coins 100% of the time, eventually they'll slip up and get found out), but blacklisting is not the solution.Read up on ""taint analysis""."

1 BTC is ~$12.50 atm and you recommend 2 BTC ($25).  That's pretty high for an indie game of this quality.  I mean in comparison most acclaimed indie games go for about $10 or less on Steam on average and I don't think your game is acclaimed or anywhere near that average quality.

Another comparison: average price of Humble Bundle is ~$6 for six indie games.

I would price your game around $5 (0.4 BTC) to get maximum profit and would recommend automating the system first.

By the way it looks like a great game with a lot of potential just try to be realistic about your pricing.  When you're just starting out it's much better to under price for exposure too so don't be afraid to aim too low when pricing.Yay, Haskell and Bitcoin in one place!

2012-09-25 17:46:19;First Look at BFL's ASIC Hardware (PCB Renders);"For the record, I didn't accuse you of being Sonny.  I was merely pointing out how irrational it is to assume some anonymous Internet source can or should be trusted in a situation like this.

I'm just trying to get people to be more cautious and more reasonable with their money.  Ultimately, I want BTC to succeed.  Right now the BTC community is absolutely chock full of two things: scam artists and incompetently run businesses.  We have to fix both these problems, and individual users being more skeptical with their hard-earned BTC is a big first step.

And again, *for the record*: I'm not saying BFL *is* a scam.  But if they aren't, they fall into the second category.Looks like a pretty standard PCB scheme to me. Can't really tell how many layers or the power trace, but I don't see any obvious problems. Power distribution and RF noise to the chip i/o lines would be the relevant concerns, but you can't tell from a pic like this... I'm wondering where the heatsinks go, if there are any, hoping they include a nice enough fan that I don't have to replace with an aftermarket piece...Holy god, the form factor looks almost exactly like the 850mh/s unit I have now.  Crazy to think you can get 40gh/s out of something that small.Too bad I cant afford one of those. Had to settle for a jalapeno (pre-order 4630).

2012-10-09 21:20:53;How do fellow Australians send money to their mtgox account in USD?;"I run BitPiggy.com and I use MtGox often. Not 100% sure what you're describing. Are you wondering how to top up a USD wallet with MtGox, or how to top up a AUD wallet at MtGox?

Basically whatever currency MtGox receives, it will add those funds to that wallet _if_ MtGox accepts that currency. If MtGox does not deal in the currency, it will be converted to USD by default, or to another currency if you specify it.

Importantly, if MtGox receives AUD, they will not convert it to USD even if you set the default wallet to top up as USD. This is rather unfortunate, as the AUD market is very small.

Hence, if you do want to top in USD, you need to convert before MtGox receives the payment. My bank (NAB) allows this, but you need to be careful. There was a period when I was sending money to MtGox, and it would get converted from AUD -> USD -> JPY -> USD, paying conversion fees at each stage! Turns out the SWIFT system was to blame. SWIFT acts as the intermediary, and they were converting my funds to JPY, even though my bank nor MtGox wanted that. To stop it, I had to add the description, ""Do not convert Remit in currency received Add to do not convert list"". This description is added in the same place where you need to type in the code to identify your payment to MtGox.

Hope that helps,
~MatWhy don't you email the people at mtgox?Why don't you use the regular Australian Deposit on our website (see here http://cl.ly/image/411j3z3l3z13), of course to do so you will need an Australian Wallet (This can be created in your manager). 

Such solution will be faster and easier for you than sending money to Japan or when using third party services. "

If ever there was a country in desperate need of Bitcoin it is Iran.


Iran is also a good proxy-battleground for the current state-of-the-art for Bitcoin, so I think this article is well-timed.  Any tools/techniques developed to make Bitcoin accessible to the Iranians would strengthen it for the coming battles down the line.

One solution I can think of not mentioned in the article is to have a diverse ecosystem of Bitcoin trusted clients (which already exists to some degree but could be better).

What are some ways to make the Bitcoin client more accessible for those in situations similar to Iran, Cuba, North Korea, etc... ?
This is already here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/117jyj/as_inflation_rages_in_iran_bitcoin_software_not/Forbes has figured it all out.

2012-10-23 18:59:29;Warren Mosler about Bitcoin;"[deleted]TIL, i know more about global finance than warren mosler.wow, just wow...

I'm wondering if they really *just don't* get it, or if they don't *want* to get it, or if they misinform on purpose.

The modern definition of money is that it's anything a community agrees on.

Money is about trust. Or, in the taxes example, about force. This is what we can overcome if we want.

It's a paradigm shift. Nothing less.

Fiat is backed by fear. Bitcoin is backed by love. `:Â·*`Modern Monetary Theory is like Keynesianism on steroids. Paul Krugman will be a Ron Paul supporter before this guy aknowledges the usefulness of private, non state-controlled money.this will be a classic like the Bill Gates 640k is enough for everybodyHe makes some valid points, don't get me wrong I am a huge supporter in Bitcoin and have accumulated a good amount over the last two years, but really the three main driving factors of Bitcoin currently is SilkRoad, gambling and speculation.  There's a lot of people that buy Bitcoin with the intent of just storing them until they can trade them back for whichever fiat currency. And in the long run, this hurts Bitcoin. They should be actively spending them, while getting more merchants to accept them.

Then SilkRoad, which, in my opinion, is a great addition to society, has a HUGE market share in the Bitcoin economy.  It's been proven that https://blockchain.info/address/1DkyBEKt5S2GDtv7aQw6rQepAvnsRyHoYM was at one point SilkRoad's hot wallet until it got too much attention and they washed the coins out. Who knows how many coins they have control of but I imagine many of the large transaction you can see in the blockchain are from them, and many of the 10,000 BTC addresses you can find in the blockchain belong to them.  If SilkRoad were to be shut down (which seems and is very unlikely in the near future but it is a feasible scenario), all the coins would be lost due to the fact that DPR would probably walk away with the profits (that is if he isn't in jail).  Of course other sites would pop up, such as sites that already exist like Black Market Reloaded, but imagine the time it would take for the SilkRoad community to migrate/even know of ""safe"" alternatives. I imagine many would be spooked and the media would play it as a huge victory and instill more fear into the public.  And probably use Bitcoin as an example of what criminals and drug dealers use to steal the taxpayer's dollar.

So yeah, thats my 2 satoshis. Theres a lot of people that blindly support Bitcoin and really need to look at how fragile this system is.  If we want the day were our Bitcoin is worth $100 or even $1,000 each we have to make it seem less of a ponzi scheme/drug dealers paradise and more of an actual good in society.Guys like this don't get it and won't get it... ""their cup is already full""Warren Mosler is a chartist of the worst kind.  I'm not sure whether he has any concept of causality whatsoever.  And this clip just reinforces that.

It does bring some peace of mind for when I have a decent amount of funds sitting in my account.I received the same email. Since I don't need a YubiKey, here's my code to get the free YubiKey. I'm sure someone can make good use of it!

But two factor authentication is a MUST... use *one of them*.I didn't get it today, but I got one a few months ago. It expires at the end of the year. I am thinking about trading it in, but I just haven't gotten [a round tuit](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/round_tuit).Can I use this Yubikey for any other internet account that supports one as well as at Mt. Gox?"
2012-11-20 19:43:33;Personal review: MtGox is as unsafer as paypal;"You ran afoul of KYC and AML laws. Blame the war on terror and drugs, not Mt Gox, which needs to comply because, unlike yourself, they are not protected by anonymity and would face full liability exposure and possible jail time if they were to let other people using the same technology as you to do notoriously nefarious acts funded through Gox.

These requirements have been known for a while, so while I am sorry for your situation, this is not something that should have been a surprise. At this point, I can't help but feel that you have done this a little to yourself.

I understand the risks you have in identifying yourself to your host country, but Mt Gox is in Japan, and so sending them your KYC documents is not going to expose you there. If you are really that concerned about operating over clearnet, then I would suggest that you find an anonymous Wifi cafe to do work on transferring your coins to a private wallet. If this is unacceptable to you, you will need to travel out of that country temporarily in order to do your transactions. You are the one with the extremely specific privacy needs, so you need to take the steps necessary to fulfill them.When working with a bitcoin merchant, always test with small amounts first, so as to limit your risk.What is the risk to your life in submitting identifying docs to MtGox?
Are you concerned that a company in Japan will reveal it's entire customer list and information to your government?
Do you believe your government can snoop on the HTTPS protected channel to MtGox?
I'm just trying to understand the issue.
Rubbish. They clearly state that TOR/VPN shines a light of suspicion on accounts.

As a fully verified user of MTGOX, I can say they are very reputable and responsive to support requests.

Just last week I Dwolla'd $1000 to them and forgot to include my MTGOX code. As soon as Dwolla said the money cleared I realized my mistake and emailed MTGOX support. Within an hour, they had identified my deposit and credited my account.

MTGOX is a fair and reputable company and their history and actions through all the trouble they've encountered exemplifies that.How many bitcoins are you talking about here? And why would you use MtGox to exchange them for currency if the only way to withdraw your currency is to give them identifiable personal bank information?They few times I have used mtgox its never been an issue. I always VPN to it both from my work and from home (mind you I did attempt to verify before even depositing cash so were probably a little lax). TOR would obviously raise flags though. It is in their T & C. Really should check this out before doing such things It is stated right there on the sign-up page:

""* Please be advised that accessing your account via the Tor network and/or public proxies may result in a temporary suspension of your account, and having to submit AML documents.""

 - https://mtgox.com/signupYou mentioned you needed a ""few"" bitcoins.  How much are we talking about here?Many have posted about this kind of problems before.  While it is of course OK for MtGox to demand AML verification for people behaving suspiciously for any definition of suspicious that they choose (as long as they say so), it is CERTAINLY NOT OK to wait until the user deposits funds.  If they can block withdrawals, they could certainly also block displaying the deposit address - if they wanted to.

And for submitting AML documents if you live in a country where that kind of stuff is illegal - that would just be stupid, probably better to loose the 40 BTC.  I do not think that MtGox will publish such documents, but they could be hacked, or a disgruntled employee could publish them all on pastebin, setting everyone up for an identity theft nightmare or worse!
There is such a simple solution to this, which has already been mentioned - simply give the username and password to someone who is willing to divulge their details and let them withdraw either the bitcoins or the money. Surely you'd have had to divulge some details when it came to withdrawing the money bought with the bitcoins, so what's the difference? I really don't see the problem here!mtgox_config.php

2012-11-20 16:27:02;How will the bitcoin network handle large transaction volumes?;"[deleted]Right now, not very well. 

But from a theoretical perspective it can and will handle them just fine. Various optimizations can be done to make it more reasonable to verify and store many transactions. And even dedicated hardware is more than possible. 

But I have and continue to propose a system where every node downloads a complete copy of a very small section of the block chain and verifies only transactions related to that section. This way the network remains distributed. 

Plans and or code for most of these ideas are already in place. Bitcoin can probably handle about 150 million transactions per year, or ~5 per second.

Source: assume 3k transactions will fill each block with 1MB of data. so 3k/10 minutes = 300 per minute or 5 per second.I think increasingly bitcoin transactions may happen through other payment networks with only the net settlement being commited to the blockchain.

Currently blocks are limited to 1MB in size and one rougly every 10min, this limits the maximum possible blockchain expansion to ~52GB per year and that in turn does place a limit on the rate of transactions that can be booked. 

If more transactions are being produced than will fit in a 1MB block they will have to compete with each other using transaction fees in order to be accepted.

I guess that before that happens there may be a hard fork to remove the block limit - many of the developers have spoken out in favour of doing so, but I guess we'll have to wait and see if that ever happens. I have no idea if it will be politically feasible or not.Right now there are a lot of Bitcoin transactions that don't hit the blockchain.  None of the trades on Mt. Gox for instance, appear in the blockchain.  Or when I make a wager on bitZino -- those don't appear in the blockchain.

So not every transaction must go through the Bitcoin network.

This is different from most other payment networks. 

mining pools and exchanges could very well make up a significant portion of the full network nodes that mirror ALL transactions. They will have high bandwidth pipes and large disks because they'll be able to afford to. Others that can run full nodes will for fun. Still others, probably the vast majority of bitcoin clients, will only mirror transactions they care about."

2012-12-11 23:07:29;Why can't we develop biometrically authorized Bitcoin payments?;"You can, but the security of biometrics is less than long passwords if your whole computer is comprimised. With biometrics the encryption key has to be stored somewhere on your computer, as biometrics (to my knowledge) cannot be a key directly as the readings are slightly different each time you scan.There are two projects that are developing a hardware wallet in the form of a USB key which will require you to press a button or enter a pin in order to authorize a transaction.

Read about it here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122438.0

and here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=127587.0[deleted]Because the computer that evaluated the biometrics is the one that has the virus that can just read the keys out of memory directly.yea and then someone copies your fingerprint... now you need a new hand :/Sure.  Just get a biometric scanner, and when your Bitcoin client asks for a phrase to encrypt your wallet with, use it to generate whatever text it generates when it takes a fingerprint reading.

Basically, use it the same way as you would use it for a password anywhere else.security boils down to a combination of:

* what you have
* what you know

Using both of them is more secure than using just one.Any EWallet provider could offer this, just as 2FA/Google Authenticator (OTP) is a security option many have added.

But then you'ld need to trust the EWallet provider with yoru coins.

Smart phone != biometric data reader. Those things can barely track finger movements, not even *close* to reading the lines of a fingerprint...Linking money to biometrics means someone is going to cut off your hands."

https://blockchain.info/address/1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1TRight. A brainwallet password has to be much, much stronger than what you'd use for websites or even encryption. It's likely that several people are right now running programs that try to guess brainwallet passwords. I'd be uneasy with using even a 14-character random password for something like this. You're basically daring the entire world to guess your password.

Brainwallet tools should ask users for unforgettable personal info such as full names and use this info as salt for the passwords.I like to take a short poem and take the first word from each line. A while ago, someone on the forum wrote a script that generated a shitton of brainwallets out of an hacked password list from some bitcoin related service, then searched the blockchain for the addresses in those wallets. He got an impressive amount of occurrances, even tho most of them had null balance. 

So yes, brainwallets with weak or compromised seed can (and will) be easly hacked.Yes. You should use ""<your e-mail address> password"" instead.Is there any reason why a passphrase should be used rather than a random string?Couldn't someone quite easily use some sort of packet sniffer to find a phrase I'm typing in to encrypt/decrypt at bitaddress, or someplace else?"

Typically this feature is only for merchants but if your family member wanted to set up a WalletBit account I would be happy to make sure it gets approved for bank deposits.The factors that matter for any cash-out decision are:

 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to trade?
 - What type of cash are you looking to receive?
 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
 - Is privacy important?

Is there someone near your family member with an ad listed on LocalBitcoins who is looking to buy?

2012-12-11 21:03:55;Bitcoin wallet on TrueCrypt on Google Drive;"It should be safe, as long as the true-crypt password is long and secure (not used elsewhere).

You are correct in assuming that, even if someone gets access to your Drive account, they would still need to decrypt the TrueCrypt volume.

Many people already do similar things by backing up encrypted wallets to email, or Dropbox.It should be safe as long as you use a keyfile to decrypt the volume ( http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=keyfiles ) ideally the file should not by in Google Drive and only you should know what file it is... 

Ahh... and don't loss it!Depends on the kind of attacks. In your case keyloggers may still be able to scoop your passphrases so be leery of using your wallet on strange machines. Ideally store them offline, sign transactions offline, then broadcast them online. That way is pretty much the only way to be 100% secure. > The biggest security hole then becomes Google Drive, as it's password is the shortest of all in the process to get to my bitcoins.

This is not true, an attacker would need to know both your GD password AND your TC password (and your Multibit password).

The biggest security hole is, imo, your computer getting infected by malware. That would bypass both GD and TC completely, and they only need to keylog your MB pass.

My recommendation would be to just skip the truecrypt step, and focusing on having a strong password on your wallet.I haven't used GoogleDrive, but I have used other sync programs like rsync and have found that the TrueCrypt encryption won't be recognized as changed when syncing. You may find you need to manually upload it every time you change the data enclosed in the encryption. Unless GoogleDrive uses a different method than rsync to recognize changes.

tl:dr May have trouble keeping synced to GoogleDrive.Has anyone else done this? With success? I'm not sure how Drive monitors and changes the ""cloud"" version of the truecrypt volume. There is potential for loss of BTC there, I would think. If I import 100BTC, then shutdown my client, and dismount Truecrypt, is there a way to verify what is online, vs locally stored waiting to upload? To help prevent this,  I made my volume 3mb in size... Can't you get secondary verification, in other words every time you log onto your account from a separate computer onto google, you get a text to your cell phone to verify it's a safe computer?"

If you pay too small of a tx, you have to wait for a generous miner to place the transaction into the block, and they may not be the one who solves it for quite some time.  

tldr; Tx won't be included until a block is solved minimum.Its a myth that txs with no fees are processed slower:

This implies running more nodes on the network, and I run my own on my server (just for fun, not because I have to). Also, using Electrum means that my wallet is getting backed up every day with my automated backup system, so this is part of having more control.use both but elected is really awesome for offline storage as it lets you sign transactions offline and inject into the network from an online computer.I like the brain wallet functionality in Electrum.

2012-12-18 23:16:16;Are bitcoins vulnerable to an irrational attack?;"strictly speaking, bitcoins can not be counterfeited, no matter how much you spend on equipment or personnel. However, if you have the resources of a government, you can theoretically disable the bitcoin network with an attack called 51+% attack. At least, as it currently stands.

An attack like this would likely take at least a year, maybe more to prepare for and would cost on the order of tens of millions of dollars for the hardware. Once built, the electricity costs to keep it down would be millions per year.

However, Bitcoin is not the only network of it's kind and it's reasonably simple to setup alternative networks. It'd be a whack a mole game.

This is assuming the technology is not improved so it's better resistant to 51+% attacks. An attack like this would motivate the significant portion of the talented programmers currently involved with Bitcoin to find a solution.

So, if this happened, it'd likely only set the wide use of a Bitcoin-like global cryptocurrency back by a couple of years at most. 
If you have massive computing power you can attempt a double spend, that is a double spend of your own money. Its not counterfitting as such.The question is more why would they want to? I mean, much as it may seem like politicians are idiots who waste obscene amounts of money on crap, they're not (idiots that is), and there is method in their madness, so they're not going to blow that amount of resources just for the jollies or to stick it to BitCoin when the resources can be more profitably employed (for them) bribing voters and other more politically relevant goals. BitCoin really isn't a threat to them, oh they'll take whatever free political capital they can by talking up that BTC's are used to pay for illegal goods and all of those nonsense arguments, but beyond that it's barely on their radar. (And yes I'm aware of the existence of published official reports. It's government: They make reports about getting out of bed in the morning) There are also other tools at their disposal to achieve whatever real world political goals they may wish to pursue vis-a-vis BitCoins.

Or to put it another way, if they can address whatever future concerns they may have with BTCs without trying to take the entire network down, they will. But the mere existence of the BitCoin network isn't likely to be of concern to them, how BTC's are used in ways they don't like that's what they would likely go after, with specific targeted measures.the US dollar is vulnerable to attack.

2012-12-25 18:05:27;A few holidays words from Charlie Shrem, co founder of BitInstant;"Goals for Bitcoin by this time next year:

*4x more users/owners/savers of Bitcoin currency

*Price stable with low volatility around 30 USD

*At least 2 more major announcements on par with the French bank and Wordpress (in terms of gravity/influence)

*A handful of new high quality introductory videos explaining Bitcoin to laypersons, making our job as evangelists easier!Well said!

+tip 0.05 BTCThought it said ""Charlie Sheen"", did a double take.Happy Happy! Thanks for a great year :)Continue your goodwork. Your team rock everywhere between Las Vegas and Macau.Bitcoin will prevail!Live long and prosper. Salud!When I first started buying bitcoins and participating in the market, I used MtGox once, then found bitinstant and used that from now on. I used it about half a dozen times and found the convenience and speed, along with the ease of use, amazing. At first I was a little intimidated by getting started, which I assume is the case with most new users.

However, and while I understand the urge to separate the bitcoin market from the traditional banking market. when bitinstant dropped the feature that allowed me to go to wells fargo and make cash deposits that appeared within minutes in my wallet, to having to go to CVS, WalMart, etc..it stopped me from using bitinstant. Around the same time, I think you guys went offline for awhile or something. I don't quite remember but I know that due to some of the changes you've implemented, I haven't bought bitcoins since. Granted, I'm one of the ones that did use your service on the silk road among other places, so you may be glad I'm no longer one of your customers. 

I generally don't comment on things like this but since you are a part of the team, I felt you should know that not everyone is happy with the changes you've made and I've started looking for other bc providers. I bookmarked your site and was a loyal customer, while not a huge one, for a few months. Then the price went from 9 USD to 10 to 12, now you say it's at 13.  I just felt it was important to let you know this. 

Congrats on having a successful company and helping give the community some legitimacy but, I for one don't use it anymore and I really wish you would reconsider on adding the in-bank option. Part of what I loved about bitinstant was that it was instant. That is no longer the case and I feel that I should let you know that. I'm sure you had your reasons but even if they were for the greater good, you lost at least one customer because of them.

Despite this, congrats on making it a year. That is quite an accomplishment for any new business and my hats off to you. I'm just sorry I can't enjoy the ride any more.Really was a great year. Glad I was able to get in, be part of it, and work with such smart people. Looking forward to the day there are a lot more merchants taking it. Cheers to everyone!"

2012-12-25 04:23:50;Anybody know any tor-friendly Bitcoin markets?;"Tor friendly is one thing.  But using a hidden service is just asking to get robbed.any bussiness operating with legal tender needs an AML policy. Tor and AML dont get along. But tor and bitcoin do. Just keep your money in btc or take your risks via SR cash in mail.Can I ask why? Obviously, if it's sensitive, I don't need to know, but it just seems to me that it would be almost universally more simple to just buy bitcoins on the clearnet and anonymize them or buy them with cash offline if anonymity is your only goal.http://localbitcoins.com

Also, there are dozens of people who sell bitcoins for cash-in-the-mail on SR.Yah, it's somewhat pointless to use MtGox via Tor. I don't know what you gain from hiding your identity from MtGox, since once you've purchased your bitcoins (which is very difficult to do anonymously if you start with fiat $) you can easily anonymize them by running them through several bitcoin wallets or a mixing service. After that you're going to be on the dark side and nobody can track you, unless you do something to expose yourself. Good luck![deleted][BTC-e.com](http://btc-e.com/):

2013-01-01 23:52:34;Bitcoin in danger of becoming a fiat currency?;"So? fractional reserve currencies can be based off of any asset. Got cheese? how about [fractional reserve cheese](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8228131.stm)?

If you don't like fractional reserve banking then don't deposit your cheese in a bank, borrow someone else's cheese notes or accept cheese notes in trade.

If you plan on persuading others to not part with their cheese then you have my support but if you plan on stopping people from doing with their cheese what they want then fuck you, you are just as much the problem as the central bankers because you are thinking like them. Thinking you know better how people ought to run their lives than they do but without being able to actually convince them. 

If you want to stop people from getting into debt then offer them an alternative that is more attractive (for example ripple) or hard work and saving. Indeed history could repeat itself.

But people back then maybe could not get informed so easily. Today we live in the information age.

A free and functional market requires responsible consumers. What we need to demand from Bitcoin banks of the future is maximum transparency.

These Bitcoin banks could offer two kinds of services: To administer a wallet and keep it safe for you, offering no interest; or, you give them your bitcoins so that they can re-lend them, for which you can receive interest (or risk loss).

The validity of first service can even be transparent and verifiable any time via the blockchain. In the second case, the bitcoins are no longer yours, they now belong to the bank, or to the borrower respectively.> there is no central authority that decides how many bitcoins must be on hand to repay depositors who wish to withdraw. 

But there is a de-central authority - ""the people"". There already has been one incident in which MtGox agreed to move their entire balance to a single address to prove that they were maintaining a full reserve. The moment the first fractional reserve institution in the Bitcoin community pops I can see it becoming an industry standard for banks to periodically prove that they have at least a certain percentage of deposits stored as a BTC reserve.

Of course, such a thing may never happen, and greed on one side and negligence on the other may win out instead, but the fact that the Bitcoin community has already managed to secure 80%+ cold storage policies from most exchanges after the past year's string of thefts gives me hope.Even if that happen, it will completely optional and you can still opt to control your own Bitcoins with a Bitcoin client instead to use that type of services.This is fractional reserve banking not fiat currency. And if they cannot lend out more than they have on account then it's not even fractional reserve. What you've posted makes no sense as unlike the current central banking system there is no way to create the funds needed to loan out more than on account. Sure, a bank can accept bitcoin deposits and lend them out but they cannot create new bitcoins to lend out more than they received - hence, there is no fraction of bitcoins in reserve. That is, they never lend more than they owe.

It is still true that the bank may end up not able to repay the deposits made. But this has nothing to do with fractional reserve and does not cause any growth in the money supply. ie. inflation.

Bitcoin cannot become ""fiat"" unless some country chooses to enforce use of Bitcoin. Hard to imagine that happening as there would be no advantage for the rulers of that country.

TLDR; you're overreacting to something you've only imagined. This bank thing you're describing sound exactly like the Pyramid that has been flagged in the Bitcointalk a few days ago.That would be a separate ""currency"" or stored value that is *based on* bitcoin, but not bitcoin.  You stopped using bitcoin when you bought the ""JP Morgan Chase^Â® BitBucksâ¢"" with them.  In the long run this could certainly happen but not for a while yet (fractional reserve banking, not fiat currency).  If you deposit money in a bank you know they are (in theory!) carefully watched and regulated by nation states and as a last resort, if they fuck up the government will honour your deposit and pay back your money.  If you deposit money in some hypothetical ""bit coin bank,"" they lend most of it out and then fuck up, you've just lost your money.  This isn't going to change until governments decide to start regulating the bitcoin economy, so no time soon.

Also, in order for nation states to ""back up"" deposits they would have to build up reserves of bitcoins (like they used to keep gold reserves) which would require 1)either buying bitcoins or accepting them in taxes (maybe one day) and 2) not spending them straight away (can't see this happening ever).

People might just accept that there is some risk and make deposits anyway, but I can't see this becoming widespread, especially since keeping bitcoins in a bank would be less convenient then storing them directly (unlike cash).Bitcoin can never be anything but a fiat currency.What happens when you go to buy Product X at Merchant Y with bitcoins? Merchant Y will still be expecting to receive full payment in bitcoins.

Wouldn't there need to be a whole new layer created above the Bitcoin system to support Fraction Reserve Banking, that all the merchants would then also need to support?

So long as the merchants require payment in BTC using the Bitcoin protocol, and don't release the product/service until it's received, how would FSB ever work with Bitcoin?no chance bitcoiners cough cough pirate will ever fall for a fracitonal reserve ponzi cough cough pirate scheme.  never, never!  still though, thatd be OK by me.  bitcoin price would go up.Any unit - from seashells to gold to dollars to bitcoin - *anything* - can be used as a basis for the fraud known as ""fractional reserve banking"".

No way to prevent fraud/stupidity. 

However, the key thing that makes fiat money-FRB so diabolic is the legal ""backing"" generally refered to as the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) and legal tender laws. 
This gives the bank a legalized monopoly on this particular kind of Fraud - and not just legalized, in fact, but it is ""the monetary system"". 

Just say *no* to credit/debt-money (double entry bookeeping money). 

*If it isn't recorded on the Blockchain - it didn't happen!*Thread tldr: 

Yes fractional reserve banking is possible. It is up to the people to decide if they will let this become a problem. No concensus about whether or not banks can actually cause bitcoin to inflate in this manner. First of all a fiat currency simply means that something is a currency (typically) by a governments decree i.e. legal tender laws making something obligatory to be accepted as payment of debts and taxes.

Second of all what you are talking about is called fractional reserve banking and yes you are right, for example Bitcoin exchanges like mtgox could very well run a fractional reserve bank and right now all their customers have is their word that they aren't lending any of their deposits.People will always prefer a real, fungible Bitcoin over an IOU representing one.Anyone offering unsecured Bitcoin loans at this point will probably be ripped off so badly that they will go out-of-business way before they can enslave us all.

Usary requires an almost entirely honest, compliant populace.Actually, I'm sure this is already happening (the fractional reserve stuffs).
It's been done horribly wrong recently (see pirateat40 disaster) and I suspect that it's being done correctly at some services. Anyone who takes btc with the promise of returning while simultaneously doing something (/sending elsewhere) some or all of those coins is essentially doing this.Gold is in danger of becoming a fiat currency because central banks can buy it.Scraps of this have already been posted, but here goes.

Fractional reserve banking cannot be used to inflate the Bitcoin money supply because Bitcoin is already a complete payment system which recognizes a unit of account that is impossible to counterfeit. There can never be more than 21 million BTC in existence, and deposits held on books by banks or issued as non-BTC IOU's are impossible to spend in this existing payment system as though they were legitimate BTC.

When a bank accepts 100BTC deposit, then loans that 100BTC right back out to second person, then they are immediately substituting a new kind of money for BTC. They only have 100BTC available to allow anyone to withdraw, and the 200BTC they show on account for both people is at least partially impossible to back in real BTC.

The un-accounted for balances can be called a new kind of money in their own right, because bank can allow you to ""pay"" other account holders with your counterfeit balance. Unbacked Bitfloor BTC is handled in this way, today. Banks might even issue their own bonds you can pay people in, such as Mt Gox codes.

But these ""new money"" instruments cannot impinge upon the value of naked BTC the same way that bank balance USD does because USD is *defined* by the bank balances, while BTC is completely a bearer's instrument. USD behaves this way because that's the only form it can easily be transmitted over distance. BTC does not share this problem, it can be transmitted over distance in it's perfectly counterfeit-proof form.

So you might have some ""near-BTC"" money people trade, but they'll never trade at full parity to BTC and they never really pollute the BTC supply. Even if the instrument is fully backed by BTC, we only have the faith in the issuer to this effect, and an alternative (naked BTC) which is 100% as functional to transact with which we will always prefer having. The BTC I have in my wallet is 100% pure and it's purchasing power cannot be stolen via either state-authorized or greedy-consumer-authorized counterfeiting. :3[deleted]> Fractional Reserve Banking,

Yes, of course. But that is surprisingly one of the design goals of SHA-256, to be able to bear that precise burden.

2013-01-15 21:53:59;Trying to get 1 BTC, tell me how.;"Tell r/bitcoin a story about the kindest thing you ever saw one human do for another. It doesn't have to be a long story but it does have to be from your personal experience. Put a bitcoin address at the end and I'll send you 1 btc.First suggestion (because it's way cheaper than using BitInstant's CVS approach) is to try [BitMe](https://www.bitme.com). They allow you to deposit USD at any Chase bank branch if you have one nearby, and the fees are far lower than BitInstant/Moneygram.

You start an account there, and they don't require anything more personal than your email address. Just use a throw-away email address if that's something you're concerned about. On their website, go through the process to deposit USD. They will give you the chase bank account number to deposit to, and the amount to deposit (usually a few cents off of your requested deposit account in order to make it unique so that they know who to credit) and then print that page off and go to chase. Deposit cash into that bank account. Bitme will credit your USD balance so you can trade it for BTC usually within an hour. Cash deposit is free, limit trades only cost 0.6%. That is some fast and cheap bidness, right there. :D

Second suggestion. If you don't have a nearby Chase branch or some other thing keeps you from using Bitmit, then go ahead with your BitInstant idea. Note: you cannot just walk into CVS and wave $15 at them. You have to START on the [BitInstant](https://www.bitinstant.com) website and generate a deposit slip that you print out. You then bring that deposit slip to CVS and follow it's instructions. BitInstant partners with companies called MoneyGram and ZipZap to provide this connection to your local CVS branch, and they all take their fees. I believe you'll pay 4.9% fee to BitInstant plus a $3.95 fixed fee to Moneygram/Zipzap, so have at least $20 on you when going this route.

Third suggestion. Fukkitol, you can paypal me $15 flat and I'll send you 1.0BTC. Just IM me the bitcoin address you want to receive at and I'll IM you may paypal handle to send the $15 to, and then I'll send you a BTC on receipt of paypal funds. In my experience these volumes are low enough I am not likely to see any paypal chargebacks over it, and if you're more interested in getting the transaction over with than in exploring all the exotic plumbing options out there then this should get you started at least.At CVS, ask for the ""red phone"".

Yes, blockchain.info can mix several thousand BTC in a few days. I would recommend doing it in 1000BTC chunks, waiting for one to ""clear"" (read: fully process) before sending the next batch.

If you see a spend from that view address, you've tainted yourself and you'll need to spend it again at a later date.

Basically, you're depositing your coins and withdrawing other people's coins. You can check for taint at the end by searching your new/final addresses from the single address you spend everything to in the first step.

Tell your friends when you do this so they can join and add to the pool. As long as those wallet systems are not tracking user's wallets and activity, you should be good to go."
2013-01-22 23:48:41;New miner here. My friend tells me bitcoins are dead. Thoughts?;"Casual mining (""while having fun"") may be dead, bitcoin are not.

""A good rig"" may not be good enough to compete with the latest ASIC or WTF mining hardware in terms of hashing rate over electricity costs. You'll never get any profits if you don't have a REALLY GOOD business plan.You've missed *a* bubble.  It's reasonable to suppose there could be more  price volatility and over-extension in future.
You've also missed the golden opportunity for mining with CPUs & GPUs.
Now we're at the tail end of viability for mining with specialized FPGA rigs and coming into the age of the ASIC miner. Either way - getting involved consists of outlaying a fair sum on hardware that isn't useful for general-purpose computing - so it's definitely speculative. Many say that you may as well buy Bitcoins directly.

""bitcoins are dead""??  sounds like something Wired magazine would say. 
e.g in 2011 they titled an article ""The rise and fall of Bitcoin"" and stated that: ""the bitcoin never got back above $17"".  Well now it's above $17.

I predict that there will be many more people incorrectly proclaiming 'bitcoin is dead'.  What they actually mean is.. they haven't bothered to understand it or where it's going. Bitcoin != mining.
Invest in Bitcoin itself, not rigs ... it's a much safer investment IMHO.Bitcoins aren't dead but the mining 'glory days' are, thanks to the block reward halving and specialized hardware on the way.  It is getting progressively more difficult to make money mining today unless you have lots of money to invest.There are a couple of things you need to consider before making an investment into mining.  

1) GPU and FPGA mining is essentially unprofitable at this point.  The difficulty of the network has climbed high enough to the point where you are churning out pennies a day. For instance, I have a GPU that I set up simply for testing purposes, it has a hashing rate of 92 Mh/s and makes about 
0.014 BTC/day.  

2) ASIC miners are the next generation technology that will push mining speeds much higher and faster, they are also priced similarly to graphics cards.  But remember that the network will always adjust it's difficulty so that bitcoins are created at a steady rate.  What people are forgetting is that we'll all be competing over the same amount of bitcoins (roughly worth $60,000 per day) at this rate.  What changes is each person's share of that based on their hashing power they purchased. 

3) A miner should not be thought of as a faucet that can simply be turned on and money will flow out.  The ""flow"" will exponentially decrease over time.  In about a year my 92 Mh/s GPU will likely only be able to churn out a penny per week. Meanwhile the costs for running a miner will always remain. Namely your electric bill, and keep in mind that electric components can fail.  Your miner can break and then you're up a creek.

4) One alternative to buying a miner is to simply buy Bitcoins and hold on to them if you think the price will increase.  It is certainly possible that you would make more money this way than if you invest in a Miner that cannot pay for itself in time.  I think you've missed more than the bubble if you thought the purpose of Bitcoin was to print free money until the gravy train gave out.

This isn't some exploit like the Diablo III duplication bug, this is a living economy full of interesting opportunities to provide services in exchange for healthy revenues. Mining is one of those opportunities to offer notarization services for transaction fees and minting subsidies that I am afraid has evolved beyond the grasp of new users with $800 budgets.

So, tell us what you did in virtual currencies to make money? Did you farm or offer any kind of service people would pay for? There are tons of innovative things people can pay you to do in Bitcoin. Let us know your strengths and maybe we can suggest a few.You have missed the ""free money"" period, so to speak, because there was no actual free money period (i.e. it was ""free"" only in hindsight, like buying a random piece of land just before the area gets popular).

A few years ago, investing your time, expertise and focus on something like Bitcoin would seem laughable. Some people did just that, and some of those people made good money. Since most of these people were in for various ideals, rather than making money, for some of those people it's a net loss (e.g. spent a lot of time and money to facilitate the growth of a market using Bitcoin, left with nothing in the end).

As expected, once Bitcoin network and market became more solid, more and more people came in, especially to mine. The developer+user vs. miner ratio decreased, with the exchange rate. Mining profits decreased rapidly as a result.

Now, we are seeing a surge of new users, who are neither interested in the development/ideology, nor the profitability. I think this is the beginning of a new era for Bitcoin; finally we will have ""casual user""s.

From this point on, I don't think the hobbyist miner will ever make good money. It will be a hobby; you will help the network while showing off your USB mug heater that also generates money. It's good enough for most geeks.

Having said that, mining as a hobby can introduce you to the mining business. I think these businesses will continue to make money. You can either think of a new idea for a mining device and have it produced by one of the ASIC developers (or yourself), or a new investment scheme where you operate a mining farm somewhere electricity is cheap for a portion of the profits.

Either way, as others said, forget about GPGPU's and FPGA's. Also, if you are thinking about this as a mere investment, and you can find a trusted mining company, investing in it instead might be much more profitable for you. Trust is the key though.
This is just getting started! :)It depends on how you are mining.  If your plan was to set up a few GPUs or FPGAs in a rig, then your friend is right, you missed the boat on that.

If you want to invest, then your choices are ASIC miner or just buying the bitcoins themselves.Why, you're in luck! There's a new bubble happening *right now*!

If you hurry, you might even catch it before it pops.I'm afraid you're too late my friend.  It will take you a long time to pay off a new rig at this point even if your electricity is free.Dead?

They are just getting started.If you happen to already have a Radeon HD for gaming and you happen to have cheap electricity where you live, you could try mining casually.  I wouldn't buy any additional equipment though.get a new friend![Dead](http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg30zig2-hourztgSzm1g10zm2g25)

However the market for MINING, via gpus, probably is highly endangered and risky right now. If your existing hardware is making a profit great, but I would highly discourage investing in hardware since you'll soon be making a loss on power as ASICs come online."

2013-01-22 22:55:14;Casascius physical hologram Bitcoins - requesting a review of its strengths and weaknesses;"I've bought 2 10BTC silver rounds from them.

Seem legit. If you are interested in long term physical storage a better/cheaper option would be to use www.bitaddress.org to produce your paper wallets.

You can download the bitaddress.org html and it will work off line. boot up a live session of ubuntu and run the html without being connected to the internet. Print your paper wallets, place in safe.

the Armory program also has a nice paper wallet feature on it, but I really like the bitaddress.org setup. Bitaddress.org is all open source, and I've trusted their code with over 3,000BTC

also: http://i.imgur.com/uWXdECc.jpgI've done several transactions with Mike over the years and he's one of the few bitcoin-based vendors that has my complete trust.I have purchased a few coins. My main problem was with international shipping and some batch of them getting lost in customs. Casascius sent replacement coins for free, so kudos for him.

I think those coins are safe. I don't think it would be possible to read the numbers on the back of the hologram, although I haven't tried removing the hologram without damaging it to potentially forge the coin security.

Main weakness of the coin is having to rely on Casascius not to store private keys or be able to recreate them. So far he is running his business legitimately and has a good standing in the community, but this may or may not change in the future. Asides from that, the mini private key format offers a bit less bits of entropy than a standard private key, meaning brute forcing it is easier, although it is still way above capability of any supercomputer in the foreseeable future.They're fine for the novelty.. if you just want offline storage of your bitcoins then use http://www.bitaddress.org and print off a paper wallet or two. 

It's cheaper (cost of your ink, or more likely your employer's ink ;) and it's more secure since you know that only you know the secret code and someone else hasn't compromised it before it got to you.I have some 1 BTC coins and I think they look pretty nice.  The 5 BTC coins look pretty much the exact same, except they are silver colored.  The 25 BTC coin is huge though.  They are a little bit bigger than a one troy ounce American Silver Eagle.  I think they are not as nice looking as the ones and fives.  They are however more cost effective, so that is why I have a few.  I made my purchase over a year ago and I just checked the code on it.  There are still coins at the address.  Also, as far as the durability of the coins goes, they seem pretty solid.  I had one in my gym bag and it got pretty wet.  The bronze or whatever the coin is made of looks a little tarnished now, but the back stayed flawless.  I am sure I could get some metal cleaner and clean it up.  
As for as the silver 10BTC coins, they have a pretty hefty premium.  I prefer to just buy some ASEs if I want to invest in silver.  At current prices the 10 BTC coins have a $68.80 premium over the BTC face value for the one ounce of silver.  You can buy silver from goldmart.com for about $35 an ounce for an ASE.  That of course may be a non-point though as Casascius seems to be out of the 10BTC silver coins at the moment.  
Also Mike Caldwell is a pretty decent guy.  On my first order, I sent it from a Mt. Gox account and hit the send BTC button twice on accident.  I didn't even notice it and he sent me an email telling me I had sent too much.  He then sent the BTC back to me.  
Thats just my .02 BTC.New zero-trust 2-factor physical bitcoins are now sold by Casascius
https://www.casascius.com/2factor/I bought some because even if bitcoins because worthless, I'll at least have a cool souvenir. And if bitcoins take off, then I imagine that they'll add additional value to my investment, as there's really not that many in circulation. I also like the (probably misguided) security of knowing that my investment is in my physical possession. 


The coins are made very well, with the *1BTC* one actually being my favorite.I bought 20 1BTC coins (when BTC were cheap). I got them as a novelty item and to ""prove"" to my friends that Bitcoins are a real thing.

They look pretty solid. However, I cannot vouch for the long-term durability or security. (Note that Casascius could keep a copy of your secret key or the key generation algorithm could be weak (not random enough). They are certainly legit.)I bought two of the bronze 5 BTC coins. If you've ever been to Chuck E. Cheese's, they feel kind of like those tokens they have there--not as solid as I was expecting. 

Shipment was quick and they did work as advertised, but they're probably best as a novelty. There's a pretty significant cost over the BTC value to pay for the coins. "

Maybe you're including that in gold/silver, but I think the evolution of using physical gold -> paper gold is about as important as paper gold -> fiat paper.

Also, calling credit money 'slavery' comes off pretty strong and is likely to deter anyone who might otherwise have derived value from this history.Need to include silver alongside gold.  In some cultures silver was used even more commonly than gold.The theory that the use of gold/silver arose through the market is quite contested, and is not well backed by what we know of [history](http://www.economist.com/node/21560554):

>But history shows that minting developed not as a private-sector attempt to minimise the costs of trading, but as a government operation. It was state intervention, not the private market, that made metal specie work as money.

...

>Mr Goodhart used monetary history to test these competing theories. He examined the overthrow of Rome and a period in the tenth century when the Japanese government stopped minting coins. If the origin of money were purely private, these shocks should have had no monetary effects. But after Romeâs collapse, traders resorted to barter; in Japan they started to use rice instead of coins. There is a clear link between fiscal power and money.

That is, when we used gold and gold and silver it was still ""dictated money"". Dictated by our need to pay taxes in it, and by the government being the organisation doing the heavy-lifting of ensuring the coins you were accepting *actually were* gold/silver.

The developers are who I would name, Gavin, Peter, Jeff, and many others.  And then there are the people at Bit-Pay who seem to be continuing to market Bitcoin to new businesses.

2013-02-12 23:47:27;Wallet security best practices;If you have an old, unused Android phone lying around, you can Bluetooth a copy of bitaddress.org to it and generate a paper wallet there. Just makes sure mobile data and wifi are off, then write down the keys and destroy the device (if paranoid).Not a complete answer, but you might be interested to know that you don't even need a USB drive to transfer funds TO your wallet OR to confirm the funds are there. You can always confirm your funds at anytime by just visiting any website that hosts the blockchain, like blockchain.info.For extreme security you can actually air-gap your wallet. Don't have a link for you but I've seen step-by-step descriptions of basically bulletproof security that uses an air-gapped $300 laptop running Linux to work on a wallet and confirms transactions in a special way not requiring hooking it to the net ever.Properly setup paper wallets for savings in combination with blockchain.info + google two factor auth for my spending wallet is what I use. Until hardware wallets come along, this is what I have learned to be the best balance between security and convenience.As soon as you plug in the usb drive to a computer, if that computer is hacked/virused, etc, you can expect that the wallet is copied. The only thing really is to have an offline computer that signs transactions, and then to port over the signed transaction on the usb stick. However, there is a hardware wallet coming out soon, so that will probably end up being the way to go.

Once the page has loaded, unplug from the internet and turn off wireless.

Generate a paper wallet, print it.  Power off the PC and Printer.  Now the paper copy is the only copy.  Make several copies.  Send money to the Bitcoin Address on the paper, while guarding the Private Key that is listed.

I would think not as that sort of behavior appears to be the norm:

""What would be the best (read safest) wallet 'type' to store BitCoins in for medium/long periods of time?""

Wallet addresses + private keys written or printed on a sheet of paper stored someplace safe. (aka a ""cold wallet"" that is entirely offline).Bitcoin works with addresses and private keys which allow you to redeem the amount of bitcoins that was sent to an address. 

As many others have already pointed out you can visit a bitcoin generator such as www.bitaddress.org to see what a full Bitcoin address pair looks like. 

The idea is the following: 

You generate an address and print it out so that the private key is only available on a physical medium... such as a paper document. Then you send the bitcoins to the public address. 

What you've just created is a paper wallet, which is a very secure type of wallet because the only way to get to those bitcoins is to import the key printed on that paper. 

A paper wallet cannot be affected by malware, viruses, hardware failure or anything similar. If someone wanted to steal your bitcoins they would have to physically enter your house and find that piece of paper. 

----

Once you've created the paper wallet you can check the Balance by using websites such as www.blockchain.info. 

You should know by now that all Bitcoin transactions are completely public but anonymous because no one knows what person lies behind what address. 

That is how it is possible to look up the balance of certain addresses. Example:

http://blockchain.info/es/address/1BZCDZ2v2LRdGbg896CWS2JzfoZA7zzeWC

So basically, once you've sent the bitcoins to your paper wallet you could go to blockchain and lookup the balance of that address. You could keep sending bitcoins to that address as much as you wanted and keep saving them securely on that paper wallet. 

-----------

Finally if you ever want to spend those keys, you would just need to import the private key (which starts with a 5) into any Bitcoin application and the funds would be spendable immediately.

Remember! Bitcoin private keys usually start with a 5. 
You must protect this key as it is the only way you can redeem your bitcoins. Do not let it be seen by anybody and do not lose it!Buying Bitcoins to save and hopefully have your money accrue value is hardly a bad thing. Some refer to this as hoarding but they mistake the same kind of behaviour as those just trying to preserve the value of their money in a new financial instrument ;). This shouldn't be seen as a bad thing necessarily, and yes it will probably force the price up, but it also means that many people prefer it as a store of value over other currencies that are in the process of massive debasement.

What you are describing is simply saving and I'm all for that, unfortunately some people take it to the extreme and convert more than they are willing to lose because they see it as a get rich quick scheme. Bitcoin, even though it has been around 4+ years is still a volatile currency so the safest option is to convert a small amount into Bitcoins.

Armory has excellent offline wallet features so definitely have a look into that.""Many bitcoin companies are self-funded and the capital requirements are low.""

So by buying bitcoins you are helping to raise the exchange rate which is like bringing capital to bitcoin startups who themselves already hold bitcoins.

It could just say on the faucet like ""for an extra ÂµBTC, answer this question"" and then put in the question.  Assuming a 10% fee, which I think would be reasonable, when it's asked 900 people the question (paying out 90,000 of the 100,000 satoshi paid by the question submitter) it bundles up the answers and sends them to the agent that submitted that question, then accepts the next question in its queue.

>Is the United States government actively pursuing an investigation on the legality of Bitcoin

As far as I know, no.  I'm sure that they are aware of it and someone up there thoroughly knows how it works, but it has not become a big enough threat to actively pursue.

>with a currency the government has no control on, what action if any would/can the government take to regulate or shut down Bitcoins?

They wouldn't shut it down because they have no control. It is an international currency not entirely based in the US.  They could try to regulate or ban it (US IP blacklist for bitcoin related services), but bitcoin is spread P2P and that would be very difficult to ban.  They could try to attack Silk Road (drug trade done in bitcoin) and call it part of the war on drugs (and by extension, attack bitcoin if they deem bitcoin = drug trade more than money = drug trade).

>Unlike every other currency, Bitcoins are not regulated by any governing body or nation of any kind, what effect does this have on the security of it's future?

Bitcoin is instead regulated by limits in the code.  There can only be a certain number of bitcoins in existence, so no deflation from printing more money.

>Who is securing and there by insuring the integrity and value of the Bitcoin?

Mainly the people using it.  Transactions that have been confirmed 6 times makes it mathematically very challenging to reverse.  Bitcoins themselves are unique and non-copyable (you can't suddenly say ""I have 100 bitcoin, trade it to Address XYZ"" as the network (made up of individual people) would look at the entire transaction history of Bitcoin and say, ""you never got 100 bitcoins, that isn't a valid transaction"".  Value is determined by what the people using it value it at, see my next answer.

>What dictated the fluctuation of the Bitcoin price?

If you are referring to the recent events: a block was larger than what Bitcoin v0.7 would accept, but Bitcoin v0.8 would.  The blockchain (contains all transactions) forked, creating two separate ledgers.  This caused panic and dropped the price, which then rebounded rather quickly.

If you mean fluctuations in price in general, treat it like any currency.  If people believe in the country of Bitcoinia, Bitcoinia's currency (bitcoin) will raise in price.  If Bitcoinia suffered government overthrow/natural disaster/financial computer system crash, people might not see Bitcoinia as reliable and value its currency less.


>What, if any, future do you see the Bitcoin playing in the international currency exchange and why?

I cannot answer this because I do not have any idea.  Those who have great faith in Bitcoin will be able to answer that better.

>Are they're any current plans to legitimize Bitcoin as a mainstream currency in the international market? If so, by whom and when?

As there is no main body regulating this currency, planning like that isn't the easiest.  It needs much more time to be heavily adopted, but it would help if it did get listed on currency exchanges (answered at the end).

>Why should I invest in Bitcoin?

The short answer, for the money.  Because of the slight instability of price, you can play the market to your advantage and make profit.

Long answer, for the idea.  Because it is decentralized, no one group can control it.  It is (psudo)anonymous, transactions verify within hours, transactions cannot be disputed after a few confirmations, transactions cannot be reversed without a very large amount of processing power.  There are more reasons, but better said by a more involved person.

>Why isn't Bitcoin currently on any international stock/currency exchange

Someone emailed Bloomberg, and they said if someone sends them the numbers, they would post it.  However, bitcoin is still too unknown for companies to make the effort to reach out to the community.

---

I hope that answers some things, let me know if you have followup questions or you want something clarified.

I had doubts early on (it got on my radar when Rick Falkvinge did a post on it, very early into its creation). If I had stuck with it, I would be ridiculously rich if I cashed out at the $30 peak or now ($45-50 peak).> Is the United States government actively pursuing an investigation on the legality of Bitcoin?

I know they're aware of it, but its really a small player right now. Bitcoin's entire market cap is equivalent to what the Fed prints every 5 hours. It *will* become an issue when it gets bigger, have no doubt.

 >It's legal now, but with a currency the government has no control on, what action if any would/can the government take to regulate or shut down Bitcoins?

Honestly? Little to nothing. When has the government ever been good at banning something? Bitcoin runs the same way that torrent software does, and the gov has tried its damnedest to shut that down to no avail. They could restrict its growth by forcing US businesses to deny Btc payments, but they could never confiscate your Btc or truly stop Bitcoin trade.

>Unlike every other currency, Bitcoins are not regulated by any governing body or nation of any kind, what effect does this have on the security of it's future?

**It makes it incredibly more secure.** Because there is no central bank that can artificially create Bitcoins, you can be rest assured that your Bitcoins cannot be arbitrarily devalued for political gain.

>Who is securing and there by insuring the integrity and value of the Bitcoin?

The miners are securing/insuring the integrity of the Bitcoin network. They are who validates transactions, check for double spending and bring new Btc into the system. The more miners/computer power devoted to Bitcoin, the more secure the entire system.

> What dictated the fluctuation of the Bitcoin price?

Speculation. Concerns over security/legality. The fact that there are very few players who are day trading so a small volume can greatly influence the price.

> What, if any, future do you see the Bitcoin playing in the international currency exchange and why?

I see it being a **major** player. You can make money on the exchanges, but each particular currency is guaranteed to be devalued in the long run. Not so with Bitcoin. It is produced to a finite amount, and therefore cannot be devalued by arbitrary Btc creation. It is also fraud-proof and has incredibly fast international transaction time.

> Are they're any current plans to legitimize Bitcoin as a mainstream currency in the international market? If so, by whom and when?

I don't know, but I think if there was the price would be a lot more than $50/Btc. 

> Why should I invest in Bitcoin?

Because some anonymous guy on the internet told you to, lol. Honestly, this forum is a treasure trove that cannot be rehashed in one blurb.


> Why isn't Bitcoin currently on any international stock/currency exchange

It's brand new and hard for technologically challenged people to understand. It is completely different than anybody trading stocks or currency have ever dealt with before. * They are investigating, you can find the FBI report on the net. They might try to shut down the exchanges but it would have minimal effect, as exchanges are spread around the world already. It's very improbable that they would attack the network itself, and it's unlikely to work. They might come up with new laws to prevent its usage, but whether that can even be done remains to be seen. I expect none of this to happen though, but we'll have to wait and see.

* Bitcoin as a currency is not regulated. That's the whole point and the reason it will increasingly become popular. However, it's mostly like cash in this aspect; it's the user's responsibility to follow the law, not the currency's.

* Everyone running a Bitcoin node, and particularly miners ensure the integrity of Bitcoin. Its value completely depends on supply and demand.

* See above.

* Bitcoin is already being used in international trade. How it will evolve is anyone's guess. I think it's more likely that it will be used, for a few years, parallel to other online payment systems. If it survives that kind of load, and no one else comes up with a better idea, it might begin to replace traditional currencies in worldwide trade. Bitcoin is superior to everything else that is being used as a currency, but it's also experimental. We don't know what sort of flaws it might have, and whether they can be remedied. It needs time and users to develop.

* As largish businesses begin to accept Bitcoin, it will become legitimate. That needs people who actually use Bitcoin so that it provides enough incentive for them to adopt.

* I can't tell you to invest in Bitcoin. It's a currency, not an investment vehicle. Start using it and if you happen to gain some insight into its future, you could consider using it as a store of value.

* It's not a stock. All Bitcoin exhanges are already international. If all goes well this year, I expect more popular currency exchanges to begin trading as well.
>  what action if any would/can the government take to regulate or shut down Bitcoins?

They can prevent transfers to MtGox and other exchanges, moving Bitcoin to the black market and forcing Bitcoin users to trade for cash. This would probably remove most speculator investment from the market and cause a price crash, but the currency would still be good for funds transfer to anonymous people.

> Unlike every other currency, Bitcoins are not regulated by any governing body or nation of any kind, what effect does this have on the security of it's future?

That's difficult to say! (also, use ""its"" when you mean ""his"" and ""it's"" when you mean ""it is"")

> Who is securing and there by insuring the integrity and value of the Bitcoin?

Bitcoin's users, also nobody. They are worth their market value. (also the word you want there is ""ensuring"")

> What dictated the fluctuation of the Bitcoin price?

The market value is between the price at which people are willing to sell and that which other people are willing to buy. Look at mtgoxlive.com, you'll see the bids on the left and the asks on the right, where they meet is the market price. If someone buys a load it will wipe out the cheapest ones for sale and everyone else will adjust; the price will rise. If someone sells a load it will wipe out the most expensive offers and the price will sink.

The market price is currently very volatile, it is set mostly by speculators.

> What, if any, future do you see the Bitcoin playing in the international currency exchange and why?

Not sure, it will remain an outsider for quite a while, that's for sure.

> Are they're any current plans to legitimize Bitcoin as a mainstream currency in the international market? If so, by whom and when?

This is down to everyone using it I guess, by running the client application you're in effect operating a bank. (Also they're is short for ""they are"", you're looking for ""there"" as in ""not here"") 

> Why should I invest in Bitcoin?

You should invest in Bitcoin if you believe the price of them will go up over time, you have money to invest in a high risk investment and you understand the risks. Bitcoins are volatile, so beware.

> Why isn't Bitcoin currently on any international stock/currency exchange

There's at least one bitcoin investment fund nowadays, maybe there will be more in the future. I don't know how currency exchanges work so I can't comment on that.* I don't think they will try to shut it down because it would backfire.

* Very positive effect

* The community og users. But most of all the protocol of bitcoin.

* Supply and demand. Bitcoins are generated at a slow rate slowing down untill no more bitcoins are created. Demand is growing fast making the price go up. Emotions make the price fluctuate for no good reason.

* I see Bitcoin as the worlds main currency. Because no one can regulate the transactions or inflate the money supply.

* It is already legit. The people who stad to benefit from using it. Mostly online merchants.

* You should research and deside yourself. Breaking the governments monopoly on money would be good for everybody long term. You could stand to earn on increased value of bitcoin.

* Still very young. But it will probably happen the other way round. International merchants will shift to bitcoin exchanges because of less regulation.

2013-03-12 23:25:43;Is bitcoin for me?;"(this is my asshole answer. I'll do a real answer in another comment) 

I am amazed. You understand medicine at the level of both a surgeon and a physician. You understand pharmacology as a pharmacologist. You understand automobiles as a mechanical engineer. You understand the Internet as both a computer engineer and a software developer. You are a nutritionist, a physicist, a chemist, a biologist, a mathematician... Nothing you do is beyond your scope. You are the Master of Orion. My other comment is my answer to your last question. 

Assuming you've already gone the we use coins dot org route, there are a lot of other great walk throughs around - but I'm on my phone so I can't be bothered to look them up. 

There are no coins. There is only a giant ledger. The ledger has pages (blocks). To certify the page someone needs to sign it (miner). New bitcoin are introduced to the system whenever this happens (mining) in the account of the miner as a reward for certifying the page of the ledger. 

It took me two weeks to get a grasp on it, as a semi-tech head non-programmer, and still learning new things now.

I'm a libertarian too, so from that POV this is the best currency that humanity has ever developed.

I'd say the best assurance that you can trust it is the actions of those in the know, those who've put thousands and millions of their own money into bitcoin, having done their research.

It's natural not to trust that which you don't understand. At the same time you don't need to understand the math behind it, just how it works. So take the time to do your research, read others' questions and answers, and then take it from there.

If you have a question, chances are someone's asked it before. Do a quick search on here, upper right-hand search box.blocks = ledger pages

mining = writing new pages to the ledger - with a bonus reward of brand new bitcoins for successfully doing so in accordance with strict protocol rules.

blockchain = the entire ledger, pages strung one into the next, in a way that each new page references the previous page so it cannot be faked.Bitcoin is for everyone :).

As for trying to wrap your head around technical things, I have heard my master thesis on Bitcoin is pretty approachable even for non-technical people:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=88149.0I am a libertarian too... and a professional programmer.  Like you, I was suspicious of Bitcoin because it was not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver.

Using Bitcoin is like using a telephone or sending email.  You do not need to know everything about electricity or packet routing to enjoy the benefits.

2013-03-19 23:44:19;Why Bitcoin Is Not Overvalued;"Thanks for contributing some rational thought, I agree that the ""real"" value of bitcoin is not reflected in the exchange rate.

Of note: paypal does more than half of its business processing credit cards, about a quarter in stored value transactions and the rest in ACH or electronic bank transfers. I don't think these numbers are publicly disclosed by paypal so they may be off a bit.

I like your analysis, but want to contribute that I believe that it is unlikely that bitcoin will displace paypal's credit card transaction volume directly, as there are distinct individual consumer advantages for cards (some fraud protection, rewards, credit line, etc). I do believe there's a fairly strong case for the stored balance and ACH competition from bitcoin, especially in niches where paypal can't compete effectively (global payments, remittances, grey market goods, digital services with low margins).> If bitcoin was to rival Paypal at its current size (which I believe it easily will)

This is nothing more than conjecture. You offer not numbers or evidence to back this up.

>You would expect the market cap of bitcoins to increase proportionally to their transaction volume

They're completely unrelated. 

> **Concomitant**, Bitcoins price would still..

Trying to find a way to put your dictionary word of the day to use?

> I would imagine that bitcoins will eventually exceed Paypal in popularity and use

Why? They're less safe and much more confusing to use for your average person doing everyday online shopping. Not to mention the price fluctuation makes it a headache for retailers. It is very simple, really. Most people hoard, and there was reward halving on one side and surge of long-term interest on the other side. Price went up. Bitcoins are not something one can make on will, thus the only way to drop price is to dump huge amount of hoarded coins on exchanges. Will that happen? I bet it won't. I sure don't feel like cashing out now.so, sell at 338?And therin lies the problem with your theory.

Bitcoins are totally virtual.  As long as other people are willing to buy the virtual coin from you, then they are worth something.

But if a bunch of people holding them decide suddenly that they have a feeling this is no longer the case, or the willingness of people to buy them suddenly goes down, then you could in theory be holding onto something that could be totally worthless tomorrow.

Will it keep climbing?  Probably.  But the higher it goes, the more the temptation for those holding them for a while to dump-simply because they see people buying and willing to buy.

We could very well also be one major fork or other similar issue away from it totally going down as well.

Sure it looks great and feels great.  But I got out at $48 a few days before the fork, and it lost 20% of its value before rebounding that night.  Those kind of shifts when you get closer to $100 will make more people panic.  A $10 shift is pretty bad, a $20 shift will scare people.  Bad.

Bitcoin isn't like a commodity you can equate supply and demand to.  Its virtual, and the only thing sustaining the price is people willing to buy and sell at the price specified.  The moment people don't want to....panic can ensue. 

I'm honestly surprised the way Gox and similar has slowed during heavy trading hasn't scared people more either.  You could be holding BTC at $55 and a drop starts from $60, so you put in your sell order when you see it falling, and instead of getting a few bucks profit, you lose money.  It will open some eyes when some major holder reaches their tipping point and dumps a few thousand on the market.

With the lack of scaleability, your theories are good, but in a panic the system won't be able to handle the trades and people are going to lose badly.  Then we'll see what happens.  The BTC trading houses don't have the horsepower to keep up like major players do.  People are going to lose and lose badly due to these delays, and all MtGox/et al will be able to do is shrug.Bitcoin is a scam, only proped up by internet loving lef-wing ideologies.

It will serve as the opening bell tolling the coming of future free societies that are actually free, or perhaps the deathknell of centrally-planned societies.

Want to see what that would look like and how it could operate, checkout ""[For a New Liberty](http://mises.org/document/1010/For-a-New-Liberty-The-Libertarian-Manifesto)"" by Rothbard.Even though I subscribe to many libertarian/ancap ideas about individual freedom, I'm really beginning to get sick of the unbridled politicization on this subreddit. Bitcoin can work just as well within a socialist context as it can with capitalism and anything in between. The blockchain is completely public and can be used by the government to enforce taxes if they need to. Yes there can still be laundering, but just like today with cash, most people won't risk it. Bitcoin is a needed revolution in money, not politics. Although just like any powerful technology, it can become a fierce political tool, I personally despise the people that choose to use it that wayI think that you will find the answer rather disappointing as a socialist.

Bitcoins are pretty much impossible to tax... The free market has provided us with this tool. Assuming everyone seeks the interest of himself, of course we are going to choose the non-taxed system.

Non-government issued currency is contrary to socialism because socialism means the government controls the economy, the coin is the most effective tool to control it.Libertarians who think Bitcoin will be the end of taxes are kidding themselves. Bitcoin will only really be the end of borrowing and debt. 

If governments started recognizing Bitcoin as a currency for payment, they could make employers deduct Bitcoin for payroll, just as in the current cash system. Employers would do the deductions for you. Whether you want to go along with that is your choice. I mean, in the cash system, you can still get paid under the table to evade taxes. You can opt to store your cash under a matress. The current system, reporting income is done voluntarily and to lie about your income is fraud. 

Just because the government can't seize your Bitcoin wallet, does not mean they will give up taxing. It just means they will be unable to borrow money effectively, and will have to provide within their means.Bitcoin means that governments will have to balance their budgets most of the time.  Which means that increased spending would requite increased taxation, something that is not popular with the people.  I think that we would see somewhat smaller governments, though massive government would still be possible.

People who think that bitcoin would kill off government are simply wrong."

bitcoinstore instead of amazon

Just takes time for people to come over. Nobody will ever need more than $640 per bitcoin.We need to raise the block size limit so that the number of transactions per second can compete with the world's largest payment systems, as Satoshi intended, in the way that he suggested.[deleted]For $1000, it just needs to function as another payment method alongside dollars and papal.

For $10000, it would have to kill papal.

For $100000, it would have to be considered a standard part of every diversified portfolio, along with gold and dollars.

For $1000000, several significant countries would have to adopt it as their primary currency.Absolutely nothing that isn't already happening.  

All that has to happen is for one fiat currency to blow up and destroy itself, with no stable dollar to run to.  The first is an eventual mathematical certainty with any fiat currency that is A) Interest based, and B) Not backed by gold.  And the second is nearly a done deal with the Fed's extravagance over the last few years.

In fact, the president of Argentina is currently doing everything she can to push her citizens to adopt Bitcoin as their shadow currency, even though she doesn't see it that way.  :)  Their currency is already trashed, but their government continues to print, while attempting to control the situation with price controls and heavy controls on foreign currency usage and exchanges...

Additionally, the EU bankers just took a huge bite out of the butts of the Cyprus citizens' savings accounts, and it looks like they're still hungry.  History indicates that those who can directly confiscate wealth rarely stop a ""just a little bit"".

Where to go...Where to go..?

So...what would even a small, bankrupt country's GDP do for the Bitcoin price if even 1% of its commerce switched to Bitcoin?  I'll bet it would be a good chunk toward that $1,000/Btc target.

And that doesn't even consider any speculative buying.  The market will soon anticipate this, and the heavy hitters, the VC's, Reg-D's, private millionaires, and the like, have already begun to swarm in, hoping to buy Bitcoin on the cheap, then sell it at a premium as the world flocks to it.Why does it feel to me like the Bitcoin's current exchange rate is already well over-inflated as it is?it will need to be 2016 when the reward is cutamazon doesnt even take paypal yet.I can't see Amazon ever taking it, or eBay.

All of us are speculators so we need stuff to spend our coins on our we will all cash out!$100 is coming, but $25 may come again before that. 

http://i.imgur.com/HQpRAM5.pngIf businesses get involved (like Amazon) and Wall Street gets involved, then it should rise by a factor of perhaps 1,000.

2013-03-26 23:46:54;A question on the ethics and practicality of large-scale transactions;"One thing to consider my friend is that as the adoption of BTC grows there will be less control by the super-corrupt super-rich. 

The super-rich already have a banking system that is manicured to keep them rich. The Fed prints money and doles it out as corporate welfare to the super-rich. The most corrupt and ill-gotten wealth results as a function of fiat currency. 

Will Bitcoin help facilitate the super-rich? Yes. Bitcoin is so efficient it will even help those who the current banking system *already* caters to. But it will help the small guy out more. It will help the guy who does not have big friends in high places. It will help the guy who has his economic restricted by government intervention. 

The only reason btc should be more complicated at larger fiat valuations is if you're using it as a simple fiat money transfer system. And only then because btc lacks the liquidity to make such transactions quickly without unacceptable slippage. 

Why should the rich be less deserving of the right to privacy than anyone else? [deleted]Bitcoin will actually become a great leveller, in a similar way to how the internet was a great leveller (giving everyone the ability to easily communicate with the rest of the world). Currently, the banking and government system helps entrench some of the rich in their positions. 

Now, with Bitcoin, barriers to entry for so many industries are being blown away - allowing the little guy who can provide a good service, a chance to do so without unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy.

**tl;dr Bitcoin will most likely help raise the poor out of poverty, as Bitcoin will enable free market globalisation.**And this is different from what the super-rich are already doing how?tl;dr - Isn't there some way I can have freedom, but deny it to other people? I like myself, I don't like those other guys very much. The 'large amounts of money' thing is exactly why FinCEN wrote a guidance that exchanges should register as MSB's. bitcoin gets *more* practical with large amounts of money""Bitcoin is access to tax evasion for the masses""

Seriously - I think cryptocurrencies will make it necessary to restructure taxes in some reasonable way. But this is already necessary if you remember that the biggest corporations like Microsoft do not pay taxes at all.One point is that inflation is very bad for little people which can maintaim themselves but have to save for their pension. Inflation eats up their pensions. Rich people can buy houses and lot of stuff, but lower-middle class people loose what they have worked for all their life.""benefit from the social good"" sounds like a subjective argument if I've ever heard one.  Waah people will do things I don't like and that scares me. Seriously I really hoped when I grew up there would be more adults around, sadly I was mistaken."

It's like a bitcoin derivative that is backed in bitcoin but also has the added novelty value, which is worth something.

2013-04-02 23:47:54;May some nice fellow explain to me why Bitcoin is looked down upon and is said to be dangerous?;"Bitcoin is not illegal... yet.  In fact, in the US, regulators have tacitly admitted that it is legal.

Widespread adoption of bitcoin would mean that governments have to routinely balance their budgets, so increased taxes and/or decreased spending.  It would also mean that banks don't get free money from central banks (government).  So as you can imagine governments and banks aren't excited about bitcoin.  Thus their shills going to naturally be against bitcoinwhen i was first told about bitcoin by Roger Ver, I nodded but was SUPER skeptical. Come on. Internet money? That doesn't sound like a SCAM to you? 

But I did the research. And it held up.

Then it continued, it spiked, it crashed, and i jumped in. pure fun since.It can be perceived as shady because some people use it to buy drugs or other forbidden things from Silk Road.

It can be perceived as shady because there have been a lot of scams where the people operating the scam wanted to be paid using BTC because of the apparent lack of regulation and the irreversibility of transfers. 

It can be perceived as risky because it's had a very steep growth in value relative to other things (such as USD or gold or stocks), which can suggest that the valuation is based upon excitement, not real fundamentals, and if the excitement disappears the valuation can disappear, leading to large losses. 

Some people have claimed that economic activity undertaken using BTC is not subject to tax or regulation; while this is not true, it does contribute to a perception that it's a tool to be used by people who don't obey laws, which makes people who do obey laws feel uncomfortable. It is still experimental. Some giant curve ball that no one has anticipated could come out of nowhere and destroy the trust and usefulness of bitcoin. It could drop to zero overnight because at that point no one would want it. 

Every day that goes by it becomes more solid and legitimate however. 

As an investment, assume whatever you put into bitcoin is lost. If suddenly you can't pay your mortgage because of this, then you have invested too much. You get the idea.

2. DDOS someone elses pool and thus keep the difficulty down so you can make more money with the pool you are mining in.

3. Sell a lot of BTC right before DDOSing the exchange to destroy liquidity/confidence. Then buy back BTC after the price drops. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.It's been ongoing for years. Deepbit used to be down daily. You have to script your miners to switch pools when one is down."

$10k++ per à¸¿... or zero.Maybe hold half and spend half?> But the question still remains: will we see BTC ever reach $150+ USD and stay there as it becomes more ""mainstream""?

Mr. Market currently does not think so but Mr. Market could easily change his mind when new information presents itself.If it plays out like the last bubble, eventually a floor price will be established then we'll see some stability.If you are in it for the long haul as you state ""a few years"" you have a decent chance of getting a return. Once more countries in the euro fall eg: Spain, Italy, Greece which are currently holding on by a couple of threads it may provide a spike in value and on the other side of the world it seems that it might boom quicker than expected with Argentina's inflation rate rising faster than the common people can realistically handle in the long term. $250+ I can't really say but $150+ is highly possible in a few years or perhaps sooner but realistically after this weeks fiasco we should giving it two or three more months before we can pretend to predict a possible future value. 

But since it's free to make predictions i'll take a stab at $300 by the end of 2015 if it can hold it's median value between $50 and $60 till next year. If people stop selling the price can start climbing up.clutching at straws."

If you could predict the next one then you'd sell just before it happened. If everyone did that, then the crash would happen the day before that, which logically would make it the day before that one also, ad infinitum. You would conclude then that (1) the crash would happen as soon as anyone could predict any crash happening at one point in the future or (2) the new price would adjust for the future conditions so no crash would happen.

In reality no one can ever predict the market unless you have some information that no one does.When it dropped from $266 I think MtGox was hit too hard and caused a lot of lag so people sold and by the time the lag cleared up the price was $105 and then a bunch of people bought the price up to $180 and people saw it as their second chance to cash out and the price came back down. Then trading stopped on MtGox. When it came back it dropped again. Then people started buying up the price and then it dropped again this time to $50. Now the price is back up to $143. It seems a lot of people are just holding onto their bitcoins. I say once the price hits $150 we will be back up to $200 soon.

This new service allows sellers of bitcoins to list their bitcoins for sale on our website for free. We find the buyers of the bitcoins for the sellers, and instruct the buyers to deposit cash into the seller's personal bank accounts.

We had our first round of bitcoins loaded onto the site a couple days ago, and within a couple of hours, the bitcoins were purchased and the seller received a cash deposit for the bitcoins deposited into his bank account.

The seller received full current MtGox rates, and did not incur a single cent in fees. Cash was deposited into the seller's account and the buyer of the bitcoins is just as happy with the service as the seller.

I started a thread at Bitcointalk.org here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=237164.0

The buyer has shared his experience, and the seller will do so as well soon.

With that being said, if you own bitcoins and want them sold without incurring any fees, you can load them for onto our site for free. We will find a buyer for you who will deposit cash into your personal bank account.

At least, that's what The Legend of Zelda taught me. Maybe it's different for you.[deleted]> I started gambling on it, and I was pretty good at it.

I'm not sure you quite understand how gambling works...> I found out about Satoshi dice. I started gambling on it, and I was pretty good at it.

LolThe more you play, the more you are *mathematically destined* to end up worse off overall.

That is why gambling is called a tax on the ""mathematically-declined"" :P

As a programmer, this makes absolutely no sense to me. You know what is more fun? *Building new shit.*It's gambling, what did you expect?   Don't put any money in that you're not willing to flush down the toilet.

That being said if you have a problem don't be afraid to seek help, here's some information if you need help:

http://www.helpguide.org/mental/gambling_addiction.php[deleted]I started with $20, made it up to $130, and then ultimately $0. Funny how that works.PSA:
Every game of chance is built for a house to win. There is no long term strategy that it will make you win. There is no "" I am good at it"" you are not, it is an illusion to hook you up. Ultimately you will lose. Buy SatoshiDice shares instead.< Insert rambling diatribe about how dare you tell people not to throw their money away on something that guarantees people lose their funds most of the time >

Nice try, but people don't like to listen to reason.Christ all these threads make me glad I learned to control my gambling before I discovered bitcoins.Don't gamble if you aren't planning on loosing money. You barely lost anything look at it as either a lesson or just a fuck it i took my chances. The addition of the SatoshiDice buttons on Blockchain.info's wallet gives you the incentive to play which is bad. I had 0.04 btc that i salvaged from free faucets/adcoin type sites before they payed so little. I played SD twice on blockchain just to see how it worked. Small bets of 0.02 on the 50% game. I got lucky and won twice and now have 0.07. I haven't played since.. thanks SD for the free coin ;D. It's all luck my friend not a way to make money... a game of risk.lol, what is this ? You lost 15$ at gambling and are now trying to give us life lessons about gambling ?
HahahahhahaIve lost maybe 30btc over the last few months on SatoshiDice. Not worth it! > and I was pretty good at it.

Here's where you failed by the way. :P ....it's totally random; no skill involved â and if it's not random it's certainly not in your favor.> Don't get sucked in to Satoshi Dice.

Because you don't know when to stop gambling? Why is Satoshi Dice better/worse than any other gambling site?
> set yourself a minimum point of loss.

Shouldn't that be maximum loss?
Golden rule of gambling. Set yourself a limit and don't chase your losses. Even better consider your buy in as a payment for a nights entertainment and don't expect to win. Any winings is a bonus.I was doing random bets here and there (with accompanying dopamine reward rush) and got up about 1BTC, then for laughs wrote (yet-another) martingale bot to make the bets automatically, but in my haste to test it I (stupidly) put a == in an if statement instead of a >= so it never stopped betting and half a day later it had lost the bankroll. However a check of the log showed I was up about 2.4BTC at one point. Since I only used my initial 1BTC winnings from some random bets I walked away even.

Actually, I walked away ahead, because in writing the bot I learnt how to write bitcoin enabled (web) apps in python to use the bitcoind daemon's RPC API to make and check payments. All a bit of fun really. But yes, house always wins. Gambling is dumb.I've lost there 130 coins a two month ago.Why, yes. Gambling is just a tax for people who don't understand math.[deleted]> I was pretty lucky

That is all.> If you DO however end up doing it, please set yourself a minimum point of loss.

Heh. There are SD simulators out there. I've seen attempts at martingale and the like--they inevitably fail.As long as you set reasonable limits for yourself and you enjoy doing it and have self control, I don't see there being any problems with it. It's a thrill of risk vs reward like anything else in life.

If you go into it understanding the odds and follow the rule of not betting what you don't want to lose, go wild.

It's a lot more transparent than most other gambling situations so in that regard you could argue it's a better bet than other things.I did roughly the same - lost around 15-20 USD worth of BTC on satoshi dice - just seeing how ""well"" it worked. If I'd just kept that, they'd be worth about 200 USD now..

Then, a few weeks later, I spent ""just"" 9btc (200 USD at the time) on an order for a BFL Jalapeno miner.... I could cancel this, but I'd only get ~1.25 btc back now :-(

Always making the wrong choices with my btc. If you want good financial advice, see what I do and then do the opposite.
Yeah, gambling is stupid, but I think the real use case for Satoshi Dice is anonimisation and money laundering.In gambling, ""strategies"" only have one purpose: To fool yourself by hiding the rest risk somewhere you don't see it.

As long as your chance to lose it all lies above 0, you will lose it all. You just have to try often enough.satoshi dice the shit!!! everyone go gamble on satoshi dice!How about you don't tell people what to do?  How about that.  It's other people's money you chump.

2013-05-07 23:14:52;Government Will Be As Successful At Regulating Bitcoin As Its Been With File Sharing;"Here's a question for you:

If the ability to convert to fiat is limited to about 50k USD a day, and there are no exchanges so the only way to convert is face to face transactions that are difficult to set up and carry of the risk of theft, what's the USD valuation of 1 BTC?They don't have to succeed in killing it. They just have to succeed at making sure it never goes mainstream.

Harsh regulation will keep bitcoin used by geeks and druggies forever.

To counter this, bitcoin adoption by merchants needs to be faster than negative legislation can occur.

It comes down to how many and how big the merchants accepting bitcoin are, not how many of us are using it.Am I missing something, there doesn't seem to be an article here? They just flatly state the opinion with no explanation as to why or how it would be the case. As several comments have already stated, bitcoin is not exactly the same sort of thing as file-sharing. Most people here would like to see bitcoin become mainstream, and even replace traditional ways of transferring value. Government regulation could certainly interfere with that goal.I literally just used this earlier as an example comparing how governments will never shut down bitcoin just like how ThePirateBay seems to never be shutdown (permanently). With currency being involved I doubt it would even get that close to being shutdown.File sharing is not a threat to governments, I don't think this is a good comparison.About 40+% of net traffic is torrents. And that is after the RIAA/MPAA vowed to 'stop' filesharing.

2013-05-21 23:57:09;"When does one go ""full time""?";"It sounds like you're mixing two potentially separate issues. For educated & intelligent people, work isn't the thing we do to get paid, its the thing we do to maintain a basic structure in life. If your work isn't providing a basic sense of accomplishment and pleasure you might want to shift gears into a different job/career. Bitcoin may be a facilitating factor, but its not a solution. How about creating a bitcoin startup? What about providing a bitcoin boot camp for CEO's?""Soul crushing""...say no more.   Life is too fucking short for that.Your story is pretty similar to mine.  I was an accountant (4 years in a CPA's office doing compilation & reviews, year and a half working for the CPA's son who had more than a dozen companies).

I got into BTC in April 2011, and went full blast into it.  In May, I opened BTC Guild.  In that time, I fell in love with finally working in my dream field (IT).  I didn't hate Accounting, but programming and web development had been my passion since middle school.

In late 2011, I started feeling like you.  I simply couldn't stand going to work anymore, it felt pointless.  I was making more money from my Bitcoin venture than I did at the day job, but it didn't feel secure.  The job was a security blanket.  By February 2012, I put in notice at the job that I needed to start spending less time in the office because my own business venture was distracting me from my job.

Now that I've left, I can say quite certainly:  I will probably not return even if BTC Guild or Bitcoin as a whole crash so far down that it isn't sustainable to live on.  The weight off my shoulders from leaving the other job is something I never want to return to.  I still love the company I worked for, and I do miss parts of it, but there is no way I can return to a day job that I don't feel challenged at or feel a sense of accomplishment each day.I didn't know bitcoin was a job. Are you trading or you just have lots of coins?[deleted]You should join a bitcoin startup! They need compliance guys badly!!!Keep your job. Honestly, bitcoins are still extremely volatile...prices can fluctuate up and down dramatically over the course of a single day.

You will always need a steady, **reliable** income. Keep mining, but your job is still important.It's a little unclear to me on how you are making 5x your salary. is this just from holding coins or are you doing things like selling goods and services?

If it's from holding, you should not quit. People don't quit their jobs when they get some savings, they keep those savings for a future purpose (retirement, home ownership, possible medical bills). Future gains are not guaranteed, but even worse, if you do start living off your coins and the value goes up greatly, you will miss out greatly.

In addition, while your job sucks now, it strikes me from your post that you are probably young and at the start of your career. Ending your career now will limit your future earnings, potentially costing you over millions of dollars over your lifetime.

However, if you have some kind of bitcoin income, then there's no reason to keep your job. You can register your business and become an entrepreneur for a while. This shouldn't limit your career and could even skip a few steps.What is your secret to make 5x your dayjob?Until you have enough money invested that you can withdraw only the interest and survive, don't quit. Check out /r/financialindependence I would honestly take a look at what you could do on the side.  Bitcoin has been very popular lately but is still very much in its infancy.  With the knowledge you've gained about it to this point there seems like lots of opportunities to network with others who are starting up all kinds of cool projects.

None of them might return anything now, but getting networked with the right people who will be continuing to develop infrastructure around something like Bitcoin could help land you somewhere in the future when there are more stable gigs.Give yourself another year and check your results then. If you've done well the second year too, then leave that bothersome job - you're likely to have enough security to be comfortable by then and will be able to move on to something else. My advice would be to find something you would enjoy doing that would allow you to earn a steady income and provide benefits, enough to cover basic needs.

My assumption is that we're not going to stay at current price levels for more than about a year, so I wouldn't worry too deeply about making the right choice right away. A price move of 2-3X to the upside would probably seal the deal for people like you, whereas 50% drop would probably make you thankful that you held on to the job.

Picking a day a few months from now as a tentative quit date would allow you to do some long range planning, work out an early retirement style budget and pull the trigger if things work out.When you have a replacement *income*.  Coins that are appreciating aren't income.  Sell some of your coins to buy five houses.  Rent them out and live on that money.  That's when you retire.  If you don't have enough money to buy five houses then you need to keep your job.>I dislike my job.

>I also make about 5x as much in Bitcoin as I do in the workforce.

You answered your own question there buddy.Are you trading daily? is that how you're making bitcoin?I'm not that satisfied with my job either so once my Bitcoins are worth enough to make a living out of it, I'm gone. Ideally, I would have diversified my Bitcoin holdings in such a way that even in the remote chance Bitcoins become totally worthless (or, I would lose them) I would have enough fiat in the bank to be able to retire anyway.
 
Alternatively, I could quit my job now and start working within the Bitcoin ecosystem (although I have no idea where to find a job where my knowledge of Bitcoin becomes useful, but you've seem to sorted that out already). Then, if Bitcoin becomes worthless, I would still have a good resumÃ© and would be able to find a new job.
 
My advice to you would be to quit your job, start your own business and do whatever it is you're doing with Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin fails, your career wouldn't be harmed. The most important thing is to be debt free and have enough savings at hand, but I feel like you're the kind of person who doesn't have to be told that.One does not simply go ""full time"".If you are making 5x as much money with Bitcoin, put enough away in something more secure and less volatile than bitcoin first if you are going to quit your job. Keep your job and keep earning with Bitcoin until you have enough money to create a diversified portfolio of assets to live on. If you have say 500k, invested in a large diversified portfolio with an average gain rate of 6%, you can gain about 30k a year, and pay 0% tax if you make no money at all with Bitcoin. As long as you hold the assets for at least a year. Then anything you make with Bitcoin on top of that is just icing on the cake.

Bitcoin's future looks bright, but it is still uncertain. I would hold on to that stable paycheck until you have amassed enough money to not have to worry about if Bitcoin dies a week from now. just quit and start living cheap. If bitcoin fails, find a new one. You are not getting younger remember, money is no real, coin is.You are lucky -- not everyone has this choice due to their responsibilities, education, limitations, etc.

Job Satisfaction is priceless. You are smart and will always find a paycheck.

Life is short. Do something you are passionate about and can find meaning in. It will be rewarding and fulfilling.

My friend sold bitcoin at the peak and checked out of the rat race. He's now doing what he loves and does not regret his decision.

This is why economists without knowledge of bitcoin will always fail when attacking it. They'll just assume it works like other systems, without bothering to investigate why we say ""bitcoin is decentralized"".

There are no issuers of bitcoin. Any user may choose to use any blockchain they want, but if you want it to be useful to more than yourself you'll choose to use the longest chain, which is what most users agree is the proper account of who has what.

Furthermore, there are no promises in bitcoin, only virtual ledger entries devoid of counter-party risk.Replace ""Bitcoin"" with ""Ripple"", and ""Bitcoins"" with ""XRP"" and this article becames correct. :P"

>
>
>TALK BRIEF: Our ability to communicate knowledge with accuracy and authority are fundamental precepts underlining a civil society and a free market. Some of our earliest networked communication systems were distributed monetary systems; systems that accounted for interactions across trust boundaries. As the complexity and geographical spread of our commercial interactions increased so did the institutions that are part-of our daily fabric today. These institutions and their associated organisations arose in order to scale trade. As the rules became more complex we placed more trust onto third parties. A journey from tally sticks, clay tablets, coins, to bills-of-exchange and simple paper receipts to Governments, Banks, and the Rule-of-Law. As the technology landscape changes Bitcoin heralds a new approach to accounting that allows us to transact with strangers on a whole new level of networked complexity. Unsurprisingly Bitcoinâs design assumptions about trust, identity, reputation and the associated value system(s) are a fundamentally different beast to anything we have really seen before.
>
>
>Many of the design assumptions in Bitcoin are very subtle and only documented presently by the code. In this talk I will look at why Bitcoin is structured the way it is. I'll discuss prior attempts at digital cash and other applications of financial cryptography, the hard problems of distributed peer-to-peer computing, to the underlining transaction model and proof-of-work mechanism. Bitcoin by it's nature is also a monetary system that encodes certain 'laws' and 'values' therefore the discussion of the design must also discuss the economics - why the process of minting new coins is the way it is for example. I'll finish by giving some thoughts on what the future may look like."

I would guess that the most common way of making a paper wallet is to use one of various sites that create a key pair (two strings of characters) that you can then print out.

The problem with that as far as I see it is that the site has given you the private key so they could theoretically store that information and empty your BTC. People do seem to be using them, but I would advise that you proceed with caution.

[See here about paper wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet)

Another route is to download a wallet client (a program that you install on a computer). Some of these let you export the private key, which you could then print along with the corresponding address. This could be done offline. Once printed, you can then delete the wallet from the computer.

Whatever you do you want to be fairly sure there aren't any viruses or other nasties on your computer that could steal passwords/keys.

This has probably raised more questions than it answered but I hope it helps in some wayyou can use that website to make a paper wallet. once you get to the page to create paper wallets, turn off your internet. press generate a couple times. print it out. delete your printer cache and then turn your internet back on.

2013-06-25 22:45:03;Is anyone working on an alt coin that incorporates the concepts in zerocoin?? I know both bitcoin and litecoin dev's have said its to slow and cumbersome for the network but would be cool to see a new altcoin try it, I think it would really take off.;"The zerocoin paper described a prototype implementation by patching the bitcoin code.That would be a candidate altcoin right there. You'd have to adjust the magic numbers and come up with a new genesis block. The main problem is the zerocoin implementation didn't rely on the blockchain to store its database. It had a distributed hash table, DHT, to store some of the zerocoin data. You might want to more tightly integrate the two global databases.

And then there is the question of what crypto currency to base it off. I'm sure the patches for zerocoin would apply equally well to litecoin. As long as you're sacrificing backward compatibility, you can pick and choose other attractive ideas from altcoins.

The main trouble is going to be extracting the patches from the zerocoin people. Projects like this always have kludgy, embarrassing code that the authors are reluctant to release without cleanup. That will take many months and they won't do it unless there is great demand. It will probably need quite a few developers to finish. Bitcoin in my opinion is best poised to use zero coin. For those who don't know what zerocoin is, here is an interesting talk from one of the creators at microsoft research:

I don't get it, If your putting so much work into the security why not use client side encryption or something similar to what blockchain.info does. Authentication can only go so far, I don't want my private keys kept anywhere on a service that is not client side encrypted.

If blockchain.info is compromised they only get a hashed version of my wallet, if this central wallet gets compromised everyone's coin is gone. 
what do they offer different from all the other online wallet services?>3.1 What are the advantages of sending to an email versus a Bitcoin address?
Quite a few :
No fees. The transaction does not need to go through the Blockchain, and isn't subject to a 0.0005 BTC fee.
Instant - the transaction confirms instantly.
No double spending risk.
Anonymity - the transaction is not broadcasted and recorded in the Blockchain

>3.3 What if I send to another Inputs.io bitcoin address?
If you send to a bitcoin address that is actually an Inputs.io user, we'll process the transaction off the chain, meaning you get all the benefits without paying any fees.

2013-07-02 23:09:43;***QUESTION: Are Other Crypto-Currencies Killing The Momentum Behind Bitcoin? Seriously.;"Zerocoin isn't an altcoin, it's a ""protocol addon"".I personally think this is one of the biggest concerns investors have about Bitcoin and the concept of open-source cryptocurrency in general: that it can easily be copied, though to this point I don't think it's come anywhere close to killing its momentum.

>If the entire community got behind a single protocol it would accelerate adoption and add momentum. Widespread adoption makes using crypto-currencies more convenient and easy to use. And that is the only way to make it an appealing currency to the non-internet dweller. Plain and simple. It's getting more pigeonholed as an investment in the media, for speculation - not a useful currency.

I agree 100%. I think a lot of the support for Bitcoin-alts is due simply to a desire by some people to find a new way to continue making easy money mining and speculating, now that Bitcoin mining has become more competitive and the chance to make huge returns as an early adopter in Bitcoin is lower. Keep in mind I did not write this in response to the latest drop. I an not concerned in the least about that. I am approaching it as a whole.What we are seeing with digital currencies is the start of a shift from state-based currencies, to math-based currencies. digital currencies are superior in every way, with one critical Achilles heel: acceptance.

Whatever coin can get accepted the most widely shall win, and right now that looks like bitcoin. But this is a game that is in the very beginning, so really any coin could win, it just depends on which one will be the most widely accepted.  

This is what capitalism truly is. Markets and currencies that do not have masters or controllers except for the Free Hand of the market. 

For sure I agree that most of the altcoins are worthless (just check the multitude of new alts every week in the alternate cryptocurrencies on the bitcointalk.org forums!), but some do have a place if they differentiate themselves sufficiently. Namecoin for example is a new DNS registration system done in a peer to peer manner. In any case, none of these crapcoins will get enough faith and acceptance to really put any dent into Bitcoin (especially with names like RealCoin - The coin for real life).[deleted]Zerocoin is not an altcoin. It is a plugin for bitcoin (and other crypto eventually). 

Diversification is good. Bitcoin is the vanguard of an entire asset class... More like history's first joint stock company or bond than the latest iteration of 'money'. 

There is plenty of room in the asset class and you can easily observe the cream of alts rising. We need more altcoins, but we need them to be more differentiated. Adding a multiplier to the number of coins is irrelevant. Shortening the time to block is irrelevant.

Literally the **only** reason litecoin is succeeding is that it is the bitcoin of scrypt-based cryptos. It isn't silver to Bitcoin's gold. It is the gold standard of scrypt-based cryptos. 

The hashing algo isn't the only way to differentiate. Personally I think the next crypto to succeed will do so because of a different economic philosophy... Which might take a while as new cryptos are effectively only marketed to current crypto users - many or most of whom were attracted to the model typified by bitcoin. 

We may have altcoins, but there's yet to be a successful crypto that doesn't look to satoshi for monetary philosophy as well as tech. 

Edit: I'm personally in the camp on people who think satoshi was right about basically everything - but assuming everyone is going to agree with you is a terrible way to make money"

Are there plans to allow me to require 2-factor for buys, payments, or sells, further reducing the attack surface?

Right now, there seems to be an unnecessary risk in leaving Coinbase open in another tab. Not that I know of a XSRF vulnerability, but if one is discovered, it seems like there's a potential attack in that someone could send themselves my bitcoins.I am always afraid that if i lose access to my authenticator (lose phone, etc) i will lose access to my account. How can this prevented... Are there safeguards against losing access to authenticator itself?Due to Authy I'm still locked out of my account! Authy simply won't send me my sms verification.Why connect a phone at all?

2013-07-09 23:50:26;Is coinmama legit?;"At $99/btc why would you care?I'm never used them before, would like to know if this is realI bought with them twice before coinjar opened up and recived my btc both times, so for me yes they were legit.Seeming pretty scammy to me. I bought two BTC from Coinmama as a test last Wednesday. Their web page directed me to send a MoneyGram to Laurence Newman in the _UK_, so I did. Friday, I got an email asking me to send the money to Laurence Newman in _Romania_. I expressed concern over the location switch, given Romania's high rank as a source of internet swindles. They then offered that I could send the payment to Laurence Newman in Israel, a country also highly ranked as a source of internet swindles. 

Between the bait and switch on countries and Laurence Newman's magic ability to accept coins in person in Romania or Israel (but not the UK!), the whole operation seems pretty sketch. I'll give them through end of day Monday and will post an update here confirming that Coinmama is a scam or to apologize that I misjudged and they delivered services as advertised in way that doesn't involve walking down the internet equivalent of a dark alley in the bad part of town.
 
It's annoying that since bitinstant's implosion, there's no good, safe way to anonymously purchase BTC via cash/MoneyGram. I'll either buy a burner phone to register with bitinstant or give localbitcoin a go.

2013-07-09 22:38:39;Just had both of my Walmart Money Cards cancelled, watch out.;"It's greendot, man. They are cracking down. They can see where the moneypak was purchased, if they see a pattern of the distance between where the pak was purchased and where the card is registered being to far apart, they will shut you down. Even though you violated no tos. 

The joke is they say it's legit to load $10,000 a day on that card. Try that, see how it works for ya.

Sorry they closed your accountGreendot gave me a forced refund when I attempted to buy coins with the Moneypak a while back. I essentially gave them $5 for them to tell me to fuck off and that my business isn't wanted there. 

Here's hoping Paypal, Greendot, and Moneypak all die a slow painful death while they hemorrhage money.   Screw Walmart?Yeah, I can attest that was no fun getting my card declined at Costco :/ Moneypaks have been the fastest and most convenient way for us to liquidate BTC, and we have been using their service exactly how it is set up to be used. Bank transfers from exchanges are fine for large amounts of USD if we don't need it right away, but who knows how long that will last either.

This is just another testament to the immediate need to make Bitcoin more usable as a form of payment. We wouldn't liquidate into USD if we didn't have to, but that is the current state of affairs for those of us who are using our BTC.

Time to get some Gyft cards!I had a green dot card canceled for purchasing business services, I think it was Google AdWords or admob that they didn't like, but they won't tell me.

I use the amex card you can pick up at office (depot/max I forget which one) and load green dot.

Can also do the PayPal one from 7-11 but PayPal.

Haven't looked at the money gram/wu ones yet.I see some people on LocalBitcoins.com trading for gift cards instead of cash. 
You can buy them at any supermarket, and just trade BTC for the cards from the stores you usually shop, gas stations where you refuel, etc.

Seems to be the way to do it, and promote btc use in the real economy, rather than just exchange speculation.In case anyone else needs to contact Greendot/MoneyPak, here is the direct line to their Dispute Department

1-888-267-9413
have you ever had problems with the moneypak cancelled due to the original purchaser's fraud?I don't really understand what a moneypak is... I'm getting its like a prepaid visa? Or is it some kind of bank account? Is it only through Walmart?I spent about a year exchanging UKASH vouchers for Bitcoin through various forums etc only to be told eventually by Neteller that the use of my prepaid credit card was not a permitted transaction after I had loaded the funds via UKASH, they cancelled the account too.Fellow money card user here. This is not so much green dot or wal-mart just typical AML and federal bullying. Let them drive business away to others that are legit. Sucks for now though :(You are not poor enough. They only want poor people as customers. Would someone please explain the reason this happens? I don't understand the logic of what is 'suspicious' here.That's too bad.  I remembered your story (only using those cards and no banks) and was impressed.  Just closed mine.Gooooood god. Why are you doing this instead of getting a free checking account at your local credit union... or am I missing something here.same thing happened to me yesterday, I had 2 moneypaks of 500, loaded one, then when I attempted to load the second I was given an error message on the walmart site. I didn't call because I had to go meet someone for dinner. So today I'm trying to buy groceries at Safeway and my card is declined. I go to car and call, they said it has been put on hold due to ""suspicious"" activity...WTF!! told once my funds are used then that's it!Are these reloadable cards anonymous?  Don't you have to identify yourself online or by telephone first before they will activate it? mine got shut down too... I had 3.More terrorism from the Federal Reserve Mafia.This is most likely due to people using WinLockers to basically steal monepaks from people. In the past year moneypak fraud has been RAMPANT in the carding community.why ppl down vote this ?"

And it seems I can't even log in to the account (invalid password).

Hopefully you guys aren't scam, but like others pointed out - folks will use the chargeback method if things look fishy and right now they do for sure.

Wow, what a great turn out of replies and feedback! Sorry for the delayed responses everyone, I'll attempt to write back to each comment one by one, oldest to newest.  As you may have noticed, we have been getting quite a few questions about credit card fraud, systems in place, and many concerns.  With all this in mind, and the information and scenarios provided by BuyBitcoinUS and andrethegiantshead, we have decided to temporarily halt credit card transactions until we feel we have a more secure system in place.  We were currently relying on ""digital signatures"" and were going to implement a few more verification steps as the beta continued, but for now we are rethinking the way we handle the credit/debit cards in all. 

All previous transactions will be processed by the end of the day, so if you had your foot in the door early and there is a charge, you'll be receiving your coins in the coming hours (and if you were charged twice by perhaps refreshing your browser during transaction or other ways your second charge will be refunded when the coins are sent from the first transaction).  

Apologies for the wall of text, just wanted to get it all out there. While we are going to be implementing future ways to transfer cash to Bitcoins, the BitQuick Card will remain open, and continue uninterrupted.  Thanks for giving us a shot and aiding us in this open beta, the Bitcoin community as always is simply amazing! i bought from this site and i still haven't received my coins its been about 20 hoursI've tested and it's work perfectly. I bought 35$ and I had the bitcoins in my wallet in less than 12 hoursYou can use Bitcoins to refill the card at any point and will only need one card.

2013-07-30 23:47:34;Differences in Price;"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.
Now if u notice price Differences why not do ur own little business...Bitcoin exchanges operate like markets- just like gas stations have different prices for gasoline, some reflect convenience, quality and service.

In the case of mtgox, the USD denominated price is higher because if you have USD there, the best way to ""get it out"" is to buy bitcoin and transfer it that way.

Shavers argues that his bitcoin investment (Ponzi) scheme was not under the jurisdiction of the SEC because Bitcoin is not money, and is not part of anything regulated by the  the Securities and Exchange Commission or the United States legal system.

Wrong. 

So says, Judge Mazzant in a four-page order the US Magistrate found that federal securities law gives the court subject matter jurisdiction over the case. ""Bitcoin is a currency or form of money,"" the judge wrote. Mazzant added in support of his finding that investors expected a profit and that a common enterprise existed.

I love this idea, but I'd really rather not use Google's software if I can help it. Mozilla cares much more about open standards and freedom.Hi guys,

Since I built this I will comment. :)

The main feature that chrome supports that firefox doesn't is html5 local storage. Its necessary to support streaming decryption to disk of large files. There are ways around it, like a flash plugin or java, but I wanted to keep the entire thing html5, and ultimately that will make it easier to code audit. There is also some stuff in the upload process that Chrome makes easier, but i didn't want people to upload in firefox and immediately prevent them from downloading because they didn't have local storage support.Why don't you publish information about the fees clearly? I only see 4% fee, plus undefined per gigabyte amount. Annoying.

Also you could shed more light how the encryption is implemented, I don't see why I should trust the system you have deloped. Basically, why you are unable to decrypt those files?Im not much for the pay-per-download concept so I'll pass on this one. I am interested in pay-for-hosting of files. Other services do that but I don't know if they use end-to-end encryption.[deleted]Excellent idea! congrats /u/coinlock! I love this sort of techs being built on top of bitcoin. :D

Seeing this on national television says WONDERS to a lot of people: http://i.imgur.com/j2y0hJY.pngBest part of the video: http://i.imgur.com/j2y0hJY.pngRegulator translation: ""We're encouaging these companies to leave New York and setup in South Carolina.""The regulator was surprisingly positive.1) The media still doesn't get it and insists on focusing on the sensational negative aspects.

2) I really wish they would have had Trace Meyer up there, there were multiple times Jaron missed oportunities to drive positive points home.

3) The Regulator (Ben Lawsky) was fucking awesome. I have personally been dreading the day that regulators took notice of bitcoin, and I think we got a one in a million down to earth guy who actually gets it.


TL;DR Ben Lawsky is the fucking man. The media are still the media and Jarun didn't completely fail, but missed a couple of huge opportunities.Terrorism terrorism *terrorism* - **TERRORISM!** Terrorism, terrorism terrorism terrorism terrorism; terrorism, terrorism.Can anyone please link to the video, it doesn't seem to work here.A link for us free software junkies?Narco-terrorism? LOL, thats a thing now? These people sounds so dumb, when I hear things like this I hear in my head, what if he said alcohol-terrorism? I think if he did that, most people would laugh so hard and I hope in a near future the mass is going to react the same way toward dumbass that say stupid thing like narco-terrorism.Regulation means taxation and control, taxation and control means giving free money and power to sociopaths. 

This cycle needs to be realized and overcome. This is all about a continued centralization of authority and power. There are very clear examples of this right now. Whistle blowers are hunted as traitors for exposing criminal activity within the government. Yet we keep giving the government our taxes to subjugate us. This is illogical and psychotic behavior on our part and it must be evolved. 

The world of distributed everything and decentralization is being realized as we now browse it and create it. The only thing which is required of us is to look ahead and not back at the crumbling monoliths. Oh yes; because any currency isnt already used for narco terrorism and drugs and any illegal activity. Fucking christ. Great job by Jaron here, very eloquentLet's be clear, bitcoin is a poor medium for the massive scale of drug trafficking and money laundering.  First off, it's much more traceable than physical dollars, and its easy to spot when coins are mixed. (NOTE: Mixing does is not money laundering, but can be used to launder.)  Second, the scale of the current market is not large enough to cover the real drug trade.  Thirdly, the existing banking system is corrupt to the core.  Clean up your own act before trying to assert your moral authority to protect people using the bitcoin market.

Anyone got a YouTube link for this? Flash link doesn't work on android.Lol i just cant watch itdur, dur, durp, durThis is all kindergarten stuff compared to the real battle to come.

Likely, when the politicians get it through their thick heads that once dollars have been converted into BTC, there is *nothing they can do* to control the flow between BTC accounts, they will find a rationale to try to *try to* ban all transfers into and out of BTC.

I can't see how they will succeed on the ""into"" part - there will always be ways to get fiat into BTC, although they can certainly make it difficult. What worries me is the extent to which they will be successful on the ""out of"" part - if you cannot operate a business publically receiving BTC, it's going to deal a huge blow to the ecosystem which Bitcoin needs in order to grow.That video was tough to watch.  Regulators like that guy just make my blood boil.  

I don't know how guys like that can sleep at night given the amount of violence his agency uses on a daily basis against peaceful individuals.I still don't see how it is possible for them to regulate bitcoin let alone what needs to be regulated. There has to be anonymous transactions, how else would anyone be able to do anything with any amount of privacy. How can companies keep their suppliers secret if there is no anonymity. Regulation would not be a problem if we didn't have these idiotic wars on drugs and ""terrorism"" there wouldn't be a problem.The guy in the video was like, 'well who do you want to regulate it' ?

Does anyone else find this statement to be misleading? Producing SHA256 hashes does not sound to me like ""solving complex mathematical equations"", though I hear this constantly echoed throughout the press. Maybe this is the easiest way for laymen to ""get it,"" but I don't think it describes Bitcoin mining.
 
And solving this ""equation"" doesn't pay out Bitcoins. It's more like a competition between miners to produce a ""satisfactory"" block hash based on inputs provided by the network.

Also, the power projections quoted are using power efficiency measured with GPU based miners (at a whopping 650w/ megahash using blockchain.info's conversion) so it's important to realize that power efficiency on the network has improved substantially. ASICs are are between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude more efficient.Nice graphic, but bitcoin mining is not important for newbies... That should be your message. Bitcoin is great, but mining is unfortunately for experts only (say since Feb 2013).


>> There will be more bitcoins than US currency in the world by 2069

> Yeah, no.

As /u/jscribble already pointed out, this is wrong. I say: utter bullshit.


""If the current rate of production remains steady (...)"" - **not** going to happen. Not with US$ and most certainly not with BTC.


""(...) there will be more bitcoins (...) than U.S. currency"" - **not** (unless you expect US$ HYPER-deflation or complete fall of US$).

I would suggest charting how much goods (gold, bread, whatever) you can buy with all bitcoins vs all US$ (or eg. with 1/1,000,000 of total supply of BTC and US$).


Other things:

Are the pictures hinting that CPU is faster than GPU? 

No mentioning of ASICs? 



""With the Bitcoin algorithms becoming harder and harder to mine, (...)"" - this sentence is also wrong. Algorithms stay the same, only the difficulty rises -> blocks are harder to mine.

You should compare electricity consumption to the drain of established payment systems - show that Bitcoin is in fact more environment friendly as it is more simple (->cheaper).


TL;DR Nice, but do some research first.

All it really did was get people paranoid enough to start taking a harder look.  Whether in time we will be grateful for that or not, remains to be seen.  Anyway, I don't mean any disrespect.  Schneier seems like a smart fellow, and I'm sure his motives are good.Thank goodness for the mostly honest programmers on the bitcoin project.

2013-09-24 23:42:57;Why are some buyers on localbitcoin paying at or close to the MtGox rate?;"Some people will pay a premium to buy with cash.Meeting up with you cost money and time no? Seems reasonable to me.There are a number of possible answers to that question.  First, the seller may not be selling much in the way of bitcoins right now.  Alternatively his buyers may not have bank accounts, or may prefer to conduct business in cash in order to preserve their own anonymity.    Or the buyer's banks may be causing difficulties with international wire transfers.   Or they may not feel comfortable sending large quantities of money out of the US.   Or they may only be interested in buying small amounts of bitcoin and the cost of an international transfer might outweigh any savings on the bitcoins they are purchasing.   Or the seller may have cash tied up at MtGox and be unwilling to take a loss on the sale.

It isn't a scam, it is the effect that an illiquid market has on pricing.  A small number of sellers doesn't offer the same pricing opportunities as a larger market.  Without the same price pressure pricing won't stay as low.The buyer might prefer to deal with an individual, decide other criteria of the deal, like the less common payment method, but the buyer appears to be paying a premium for a more private deal than a likely more rigorous ID and/or financial info procedures at an exchange.I'm remembering something about when LocalBitcoins made the switch to using the BitSTAMP rate, it left previous buy offers (based on Mt. Gox rate) as-is.  

So those might simply be offers that weren't recently added.  That doesn't mean the buyer isn't willing to pay it just that the offer might be a little stale."

2013-09-24 22:20:04;Completely noob-ish question: If a bitcoin is worth $135 right now, yet I want to buy something inexpensive that says 2BTC, do I have to essentially spend $270 for it?;"Last time I checked, 2 * 135 is, in fact, 270.

I'd imagine many retailers change their prices manually, but others have automated software to adjust prices.

PS - 2 bitcoin isn't ""inexpensive""> Do stores that use bitcoin fluctuate too, or do they charge 0.088BTC for something that's worth $12?

Well, if the price of a bitcoin is fluctuating, then how many BTC $12 is fluctuates. So yes, if they price items in dollars, then the amount of BTC you have to send will have to fluctuate!Yes, serious retailers have floating prices to reflect exchange rates. 

For example, if I was selling coffee for $2 US a cup, and I also accepted bitcoin payment, I would sell a cup for $2 worth of bitcoins.

As of today, USD 2.00 = BTC 0.0159. Therefore, one cup of coffee would cost 0.0159 BTC at my shop.

Most sites only go to 3 or 4 decimal places, but yes, they fluctuate.
0.088888888888889 BTC is not possible, BTC is currently only divisible to 8 decimal places so it would be 0.08888889 BTC 

Usually it would just be rounded to 0.0888 BTCIt might be easier to mentally separate out the actions of using bitcoin for purchase and converting from USD to BTC.

For example, on the day that bitcoin is worth $135, you could find someone to sell you 2 bitcoins. Now you have 2 bitcoins.

Hours, days, months later, whatever, if you want to buy something for 0.08888889 BTC, you have 2.00000000 and you buy it, and now you have 1.91111111Visit bitcoinstore.com and find out. "

It's a great read for anyone who wants to know why the deflationary spiral argument is little more than a strawman for folks that don't understand bitcoin. >The reason it doesnât happen is that if people expect Google stock to increase in the future they will bid todayâs price up to the present value of the expected future price. In other words, prices adjust to match this expectation. Prices donât spiral upwards only to crash down to zero as these critics absurdly suggest. Neither does this happen if you invest in the monetary unit instead of stock.

No, because Bitcoin is supposed to be a *currency*, and thus many exchanges of it would be non-speculative. If I have Bitcoins but do not have food, and Bitcoins are now the prevailing currency, I must exchange some of my Bitcoins for food. It doesn't matter if I don't think the current value of Bitcoins reflects their future worth.

Human interaction is too complex to be boiled down to a handful of principles.look at all you assholes invading that threaddon't socialists hate money?Socialists (understood in this comment as the social democrats that have hijacked the term socialism) will never like Bitcoin. 

Socialists support stealing from people to pay for the allegedly ""charitable"" expenses of gangsters doing business as ""government"". 

The fact is that Bitcoin allows people to protect themselves and their property against said government theft.

The Bitcoin endgame is a single one: the revelation that government is merely a gang of bullies and thieves prepared do do absolutely everything necessary, no matter how abominable and despicable, to get away with their acts. 

In that sense,  Bitcoin works directly against socialists' professed goals and institution of worship. Bitcoin and socialism are therefore mortal enemies. >One question I have is that I'm a very passionate Bitcoin enthusiast, and am taking time to lobby government to regulate and support it.

Oh joy à² _à² Voluntary socialism is more accurately called Anarco-Socialism / Anraco-Syndicalism. Socialism as expounded by Marx has never worked without theft at gun point. Bitcoin breaks that model by giving the gun nowhere to point and making it ineffective when it fires. 

Bitcoin is possibly the biggest jump forward we've made in private property in the internet age. Respectfully, the people on that thread don't understand economics, if they did they would flee XBT like the plague because it is antithetical to what they say they want. However their intention is most likely just a more equal distribution of wealth an they don't realize the role the state and violence in general has played in the concentrations we see today, from that angle they should embrace it.

If you really want to mine buy your equipment off ebay imo. That way you might actually receive your equipment before the hash rate goes up 100x. Don't invest in mining at this point. No exceptions.  You would be much better off simply buying bitcoins.LOL what makes you think they aren't a scam?  "

2013-10-29 23:42:20;Long time BitCoin storage.;"The paper wallet is all you need. Just import the private key and your bitcoins will be spendable.Yes. The paper wallet should have a public and private key printed on it. The longer one is the private key. That is your password to access your bitcoin at any time. Nothing is stored on your computer if you use a paper wallet. I would get creative though. For example, print the paper wallet, then print a family picture of something on a same size sheet of paper. Put the paper wallet behind it and go get it laminated. Simple hiding spot out in plain sight. Wouldn't hurt for the safety deposit box but I kind of prefer to have control of my own coin at all times. You can write the key in a random page of a favorite book etc. Use your imagination! Also make sure the computer you print from is virus free. My fav method is ""bitaddress.org"", go there, click ""generate paper wallet"" and then disconnect your internet router so your computer is offline, hit generate a few more times (it doesn't need to be online to generate a new address, it works off an algorithm) and then print, then hit generate again so that when you reconnect to the internet, your private key has almost no chance of being accessed on the inter webs. Hope that helps! :)Sounds like you have a good plan, the private key is all you need, which is on the paper wallet.

Coinbase does what you're talking about, printing the private key on a paper wallet and locking it up somewhere safe, and they have a lot more bitcoins than any of us. :)

But I didn't want that responsibility. That being said I'd be happy to help here if I spot something I can answer. Can someone clearly explain Colored Coins to the lamen?  You asked for it: Can someone please explain how my wallet can have ownership of a portion of bitcoin, and how that changes over transactions? My current understanding is that there is this ""blockchain"" that changes for every transaction, and that change has to be guessed by miners. I'm not sure that's even right. Also, how can a bitcoin be subdivided using the hash or blockchain, or however it works. Any help is appreciated.What exactly does a miner do? What are blocks?

I don't think right now in my life I'm going to invest anything, but I've been having fun doing those stupid BitcoinGet videos and twitter things and junk. I figure maybe do a couple of surveys a night or something and see if it continues to hold my interest. I pulled this sum completely out of my ass, but I figure if I continue this way, I could make one bitcoin per year or so. Right now they're worth about 200 dollars, and who couldn't use an extra 200 dollars per year? Please point out the flaws in my master plan. Thanks.Would it be smart to wait until this wave of buyers has passed and then buy as the price settles down?I too decided to look around after seeing the news article.

Is there absolutely no way to go about buying because of the possibility of charge backs?Hi! Am I too late?
I'm pretty interested in buying some BTC, I live in Brazil. I understand the ~~best~~ most convenient way to do this is via SLL at VirWox. Only 6% fees, [according to bitcoin.it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_Bitcoins_(the_noob_version). It seems a perfect end to ""that leftover balance"" that's been sitting around in my PayPal account. Is there a better way to do it from here? Thanks!

EDIT: I should point out the current BRL:USD is roughly 2:1, making 1 BTC roughly 400 BRL, and the two people I found on localbitcoins.com were charging 500 BRL -- i.e., a 25% fee/markup...

Although the prices on VirWox have been absolutely skyrocketing over the past few days, seems like more SLL holders are getting wind of this PayPal -> Bitcoin workaround... Oh man...[deleted]I have a few thousand dollars and am wondering if there is such things as bitcoin ""stops""(might be the wrong term) like in the stock market where if the price starts to drop it will sell. 

What are some other ways to invest in the bitcoin industry?Is Bitcoin popular in the African American community?[deleted]Don't know if anyone will see this, but any chance of some purchasing advice for people in Japan?  Is anyone over here and have experience?

Hi Jay, nice meeting you last night. 

I made the sign, I'm very interested in finance, the economy and anti-usury solutions. Despite the negative connotations of anonymous I knew RT would be covering the event, and I am an avid fan of the Keiser Report.

The price of bitcoin hit an all time high today. I dare say this sign contributed to that in some way? Who knows. All pub is good pub. Not sure how I feel about this.

2013-12-10 23:46:59;Is it smart to trade all my bitcoins for litecoins? If not, why not?;"Litecoin is VERY expensive for something that doesn't have much over bitcoin, isn't used much, and doesn't have much infrastructure.  It could fall 90% and still be overpriced in my opinion.Litecoin is already very expensive. At the moment litecoin is already priced at 15% of bitcoin (0.037*4).Is it smart to trade the most disruptive technology since the internet for a cheap knockoff? Hmmmm, lemme think.Litecoin is just purely speculative.. there's not much backing it up other than hopium. . so, it'd be a big gamble to go 100%No, because then you have all LTC. Eggs and baskets. Wait until litecoin starts gaining ground cos it may never become useful.The Bitcoin network is worth many times more than any of the parallel Bitcoin-like networks, due to its greater size and number of supporting services and software. That's the reason why the total value of all of its coins is so much higher. The altcoins are much riskier, as they don't have much real world use.The main advantage of Litecoin seems to be the relative ease of mining compared to Bitcoin.

Whether you trade into Litecoin depends on how valuable you see this advantage being.Its smart if you believe other people will do the same as you. The price of bitcoin and litecoin is more due to speculation and not really how much they are used for real transactions.I have litecoins. But I feel if you were to diversify it would be better to own some Bitcoin, Litcoin, Gold and silver. VERY little fiat if you can help it. Both gold and silver are undervalued and are set to explode soon. Since bitcoin is so limited in number(even if with satoshis) it would be could to spread your wealth around and diversify, but now put all of your egg into one basket.You're not going to get a lot of positive responses here in the Bitcoin subreddit. That said, I would recommend trading in some of your Bitcoins for Litecoins. I am currently holding both coins and Litecoins are going up in value faster than Bitcoins. In the end the markets will decide who the winner is, and by diversifying your investments, your bets are somewhat safer even if one of them fails.

Litecoin is a younger crypto so it is definitely riskier however getting in on the early stages guarantee the highest returns when, if ever, it is successful. Bitcoin is still in it's early stages too though it is more mature compared to Litecoin, so it is relatively a safer bet, however the chances of making a killing are also smaller because the people that got in early are the ones that benefit the most.

The main reason people are getting into Litecoin is that a lot of people made a lot of money with Bitcoin. History tends to repeat itself. Why not make a whole bunch of money with Litecoin too?I think litecoin and bitcoin work well together but that's just meIs it smart to post such question in this sub? "

2013-12-17 23:58:47;Is Bitcoinâs deflationary nature necessarily a bad thing? (Please share your thoughts);"Isn't is the case that Bitcoin only starts deflating after the vast majority of new coins have been mined (i.e., not for many decades)? Until then, it will be inflating due to the creation of new BTC by miners.

I've also read that, even when new coins are no longer mined, the only source of deflation will be lost or destroyed Bitcoins â is that true?It'll require some new economic theorising in order to fully appreciate its impact, and that's what we need to have here - MBAs and economists or mathematicians with far-reaching views and theories in order to help create the backbone to this new economy.

Mankind survived on gold (deflationary) for thousands of years - why should this be any different?Yes, it is bad, from the perspective of the economy as a whole. A deflating currency leads to under-investment and less spending, while an inflating currency leads to over-investment and spending. The ideal currency would maintain static value, neither inflating nor deflating. 

In my opinion, bitcoin would be better off if the exponential supply growth flattened off to some flat x% growth per year. Since inflation also takes into account monetary velocity, this would not set the inflation to be equal to that x%, but it would mitigate the deflationary aspect of bitcoin and bring it closer to an ideal static currency.

Economics is not my profession, nor have I studied it in depth, so I am unable to explain in depth why deflation is bad, but my limited knowledge does leave me confident that it is indeed a bad thing.

One important caveat: I said it is bad for *the economy*. For an *individual*, the deflationary currency is preferred, so long as it remains the minority currency and debts/prices are not set in terms of its value. The individual is only motivated to seek his/her own benefit, so in this sense the psychology of adopting bitcoin is similar to pollution, where my uncontrolled pollution is good for me (significantly lower business costs) but bad for the collective (millions suffers a tiny amount).The first point I'd like to make is that the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is why so many people love it. You want to own stuff that's scarce so you'll know it will retain its value. You don't want powerhungry governments to control a printing press.

Second of all. I personally don't buy any of the Keynesian ""deflation is bad for the economy"" stuff. I think deflation has a bad rep because the deflation we know of is the inevitable deflationary crisis after too much easy money by governments and central banks. History shows examples of balanced deflationary economies. Who doesn't want his money to keep its value? It makes sense to me that stuff becomes cheaper over time because businesses and people become more efficiÃ«nt. Maybe some people like us to believe inflation is good because they have a vested interest, maybe they really believe devaluing something you own is good for you. Who knows? It isn't a problem at all. 

You have enough currency to buy a widget.  You don't spend it and then after a month you can afford two widgets because your currency is worth more. 

Do you:
A - get angry and swear you will never use a deflationary currency again. 

B - realize that people who think deflationary currencies are bad don't know what they are talking about. 

Bitcoin will never be worth anything because people will never spend them because they will be worth too much. 

Crazy talk that doesn't understand human behavior. It's going to do one thing...

Drive Bitcoin like a car... Directly...

You have faster confirmations but at the expense of security. Also, it doesn't matter that there's 4 times as many Litecoins, it's a gimmick especially since Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible.

Litecoin is merely a result of one smart man taking Bitcoin and trying to do something new but not quite significant enough.

The cold hard fact about 99% of the Litecoin community is their mindset ""I missed the train with Bitcoin, hopefully I can get rich as hell with Litecoin""

So if  Litecoin succeeds and continues on, that's cool. I just don't want to bother with it.

When the customer is ready to check out he can browse pages and pages of different altcoins until he finds the crypto currency he wishes to use.Litecoin must fail for the success of bitcoin.  The reason why is a current argument against bitcoin is bitcoin cannot work long term because it's easy to make alternate coins that can replace it.  For this argument to fail it is necessary that altcoins fail (including litecoin).  If multiple altcoins end up viable then no crypto is viable as there will be a valid argument that any coin might be replaced by some future coin.>  Most big exchanges have already added litecoin or plan to add it in the future (mt gox, coinbase).

Coinbase is not an exchange and MtGox is a scam.Why are banks so against bitcoin? Because bitcoin will eventually eat litecoin up due to the network effect. Litecoin will lose value and go to 0. People will lose their wealth and be left holding the litecoin bag.

This brings in more buyers and slows down the sellers.  So it's a self-righting sort of situation as long as people who are getting out have plenty of time to do so, as they did in this case.  If they had been given 48 hours to get out, I'll bet we could have scooped up coins around $300 during the exodus.

2014-02-04 23:56:07;I shuffled a deck of 52 cards. How many playing cards do I need to draw to generate a (good) private key?;"It has been well-established that you need 62 dice rolls to provide sufficient entropy for the public key (just a bit more than 160 bits). For reference: 2^160 ~ 1.462x10^(48).

While your private key has 256 bits, there are multiple private keys per public address due to hash collisions. This is why you only need 160 bits of entropy. It isn't a problem, though, because no one can predict when collisions will happen (so far).

Now, on to solving your problem. The probability term you're looking for is ""permutations without replacement"". This leads us to the following equation (note 0! = 1):

    n! / (n - k)!

If you're rusty on stats, this means: ""n factorial divided by the quantity n minus k factorial."" It is equivalent to n factorial for n=k because zero factorial is one.

Plugging into your problem and solving empirically, we find:

52! / (52 - 31)! ~ 1.578x10^48

This provides more than 160 bits of entropy, so you need **31 cards** from a randomly shuffled deck.

We can check our work a bit by estimating what would happen if we rolled a 21-sided die 31 times. This will be worse than our result because our first ""rolls"" have more entropy. Thus, our under-estimate is 21^31 ~ 9.745x10^(40).

This is still better than the 128-bit symmetric-key-equivalent security afforded by the private key. The private key is 256-bit, but ECDSA keys are ""half as strong"" as a symmetric key in terms of security.

**TL;DR: 31 cards**

Reading material:

http://www.stanford.edu/~kcobb/hrp259/lecture2.ppt

https://utd.edu/~ammann/stat5351/node6.html32 cards to get 160 bits of entropy:

51!/19! ~ 2^160

Edit: Oopps, a deck has 52 cards not 51. So it's actually only 31 cards:

52!/21! ~ 2^160Amazingly, (52!), the number of different possible combinations of a well shuffled 52 card deck -- the same number you posted above -- holds a lot less entropy than a private key.

The private key will max out at 256 bits of entropy, not 260, so I will use 256 from here on.

The formula in Google to start with is this:  1/(52!/2^256)

It indicates that the 256 bit number contains 1,435,590,242.3 times the entropy as a shuffle of cards does.  But if you shuffle the cards again, that would yield (52!)^2 possible combinations, which is way more entropy than the 256 bit number.  A simple answer, then, is that 1 shuffle is not enough, but 2 shuffles is too many.

However, for fun, we can look for a factorial that, in place of 52, yields a result of as near 1 as we can get.  And it turns out that (57!) is as close as we can get.  That is to say that, if you added 5 more cards to the deck with their own unique values, shuffled them all, and then drew them in order, you would achieve just better than 1/4th the entropy of a 256 bit number.  Put another way, you would have just exceeded the entropy of a 254 bit number, and 2 flips of a coin would give you the last bit of entropy you needed.

Approached a different way, though, if we shuffled the 52 card deck and drew all the cards, then wanted to reduce the deck to a smaller subset of cards such that, by drawing all of those, we get the right amount of entropy, here is how to work that out.

We still start with 1/(52!/2^256) and get a subtotal of  1,435,590,242.3.  Now all we need to do is find the number, the factorial of which, is as near as we can find to 1,435,590,242.3.

1435590242.3/12! is roughly equal to 3.  This means that, if we shuffled a 52 card deck and recorded the order it was in, then shuffled 12 of those cards again and recorded the order they were in, we would have achieved about 1/3 the entropy of a 256 bit random number.  2 coin flips will again help you achieve max entropy as would simply drawing 13 cards instead of 12 on the second round with the cards.[DÃ©jÃ  vu.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1sda0s/a_different_kind_of_coldstorage_wallet_the_poker/)Why you cannot enter an arbitrary seed in Electrum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=153990.msg1632127#msg1632127It depends on how you encode cards into binary without losing entropy.  Simplest case: Red/Black = 0/1, you'll need 256 cards.  Using standard decks you'll be guaranteed to have an equal number of 0s and 1s, which is itself a (slight) loss of entropy.You need enough to get 128 bits of entropy.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=329538.0Hmm, the cool thing about this is that unlike dice throws, the ordering of cards can be persisted. Just store the shuffled deck somewhere safe (and never use it).

Here's one simple way to do it:

Turn each card into a 6-bit number.  The first four bits represent the face value:

A->0000

2->0001

3->0010

4->0011

5->0100

6->0101

7->0110

8->0111

9->1000

10->1001

J->1010

Q->1011

K->1100

The last two bits represent the suit:

spades->00

clubs->01

diamonds->10

heart->11

You create the 6-bit number by concatenating the suit onto the face value. For example, the ace of spades and 7 of diamonds would be:

000000, 011010

respectively.

To get 260 bits you'll need to draw:

260/6 = 44.3, or 44 cards.

The first card goes in the least significant bit, and so on. For example, the sequence ace of spades/7 of diamonds would be:

011010000000

Use the suit of the last card to assign the remaining two bits.

You could use this system with slight modifications to generate any number of bits.

Edit: formatting

Edit: for 160 bits, you'd need 160/6 = 26.7 => 27 cardsA simpler way is to visit your local gaming store and get 8 [16-sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=d16+dice&site=imghp&tbm=isch) â known as ""d16"" dice. Roll them 8 times to generate 64 random hex digits, which is astronomically likely to be a valid unused [private key](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key). Import it into your Bitcoin client and it will show you the corresponding public key.

Since the largest private key is 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4141, if you should roll a number larger than that, buy life insurance, because you are the unluckiest person in the visible universe.PS speaking of cards, this is a really nice description / example of why computer-generated random numbers need to be used carefully.

http://superuser.com/a/712583

>Let's play some computer poker, just you, me and a server we both trust. The server uses a pseudo-random number generator which is initialized with a 32 bit seed right before we play. So there are about four billion possible decks.

>I get five cards in my hand -- apparently we are not playing Texas Hold 'Em. Suppose the cards are dealt out one to me, one to you, one to me, one to you, and so on. So I have the first, third, fifth, seventh and ninth cards in the deck.

>Earlier I ran the pseudo-random number generator four billion times, once with each seed, and wrote down the first card generated for each into a database. Suppose my first card is the queen of spades. That only shows up one as the first card in one in every 52 of those possible decks, so we've cut down the possible decks from four billion to around 80 million or so.

>Suppose my second card is the three of hearts. Now I run my RNG 80 million more times using the 80 million seeds that produce the queen of spades as the first number. This takes me a couple of seconds. I write down all the decks that produce the three of hearts as the third card -- the second card in my hand. That's again only about 2% of the decks, so now we're down to 2 million decks.

>Suppose the third card in my hand is the 7 of clubs. I have a database of 2 million seeds that deal out my two cards; I run my RNG another 2 million times to find the 2% of those decks that produce the 7 of clubs as the fifth card, and we're down to only 40 thousand decks.

>You see how this goes. I run my RNG 40000 more times to find all the seeds that produce my fourth card, and that gets us down to 800 decks, and then run it 800 more times to get the ~20 seeds that produce my fifth card, and now I just generate those twenty decks of cards and I know that you have one of twenty possible hands. Moreover, I have a very good idea of what I'm going to draw next.

>Now do you see why true randomness is important? The way you describe it, you think that distribution is important, but distribution isn't what makes a process random.

Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin and support its wide adoption. I think it's great that you are enthusiastic about Bitcoin.

There are indeed great benefits for having a public QR code that you can quickly show and get people to send money (think of the guy who had that sign at one of the football TV news airings), but it does remove anonymity quite a bit.

It's not that hard to break down transactions. If everyone re-uses bitcoin addresses, it's actually really bad for the anonymity of bitcoin. Imagine you donate money to this political candidate or purchase some porn, and they re-use bitcoin addresses too, then you immediately have a link between these two wallets. Just because people are posting bitcoin addresses all over the place, doesn't mean it's the right think to do. Even Reddit does this incorrectly, and I am afraid that it gives the wrong impression that this is the right thing to do.

https://help.riseup.net/en/donate#bitcoin is an example done right where you generate a new bitcoin address for each donation.

TL:DR; I think it's fine to have some public address that you advertise, though it really should be short-lived; ideally one per transaction.[deleted]Why do people think this is a ""good idea"" ?!?!?! 

This is insane. You should be using a new address for each transaction.

Or do you really like having your entire transaction history visible to the world.

2014-02-04 23:35:13;How do I generate a public/private key on my web server?;"For security purposes web servers and **private keys** should rarely meet.  You can generate a list of private/public key pairs off the server and upload just the public keys to the server.

There are tools for various programming languages to generate keys.  In Java I use the BitcoinJ or Supernode libraries.

Getting more advanced, you can generate public keys on the server in realtime using [Hierarchical Deterministic Keys](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#Abstract)Look at the source code of 

http://brainwallet.org/

they generate wallet addresses from private keys. All the crypto you need is there.do you want to do it server-side, or just let it be handled client-side (javascript)?

If the latter, check out https://www.bitaddress.org/ .  It's all open source with commercial use-friendly licenses (see git repo for details).If your server is Java you should have a look at the bitcoinj library.http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1irkqm/http://btcaddr.es/gen "

Bitcoin: major flaws found in 2011 take an entire week to fix once they are actually exploited. Well, this is Andreas' moment to shine.  He's done well in the past.  If he ends up eating his words, I don't expect Bitcoin will recover for a while.  It's the inconsistency in responses that bothers me, from the first reactions from the devs, i.e. ""This isn't a big problem at all... it's been known since 2011, it's not a priority to be fixed, etc"" to the blame game amongst devs, to now suddenly we are finding out that there are many exchanges that were vulnerable.  Best practices used to mean something.  It only means something if the majority of competent developers use it.  If not, what does that say about our infrastructure and those responsible for maintaining it?  

I think this is a major problem.Antifragility!heck the reference client isn't even 1.0 yet...You just know Andreas will throw everything at fixing this problem because his fortune is tied to it.  He is ALL IN.  I think it's great to know that the key people are all in.Does mtgox count as a ""major exchange""?

2014-02-18 23:59:19;Does Western Union need to watch out for bitcoin?;"Hey Western Union: If you were smart you would provide a BTC to fiat local cash in your worldwide facilities... You could take a cut of course, but also provide a merge of your services, with ease of use.. For example, let's say Jose in California sends BTC to mom DIRECT (without WU) in Mexico.. in the desert.. only there is a local WU in a shop near mom.. she takes her cell phone to you and WU converts the BTC to cash. There. Still in the loop. Better hurry tho.. Of course you could also provide a Local Currency -> BTC service as well.. Hrmm.. maybe UPS would be interested.. after all if you already have the local kiosks set up.. The Bitcoin ATMs are a real threat to WU, and the number of these installed around the world is about to go ballistic.For those who didn't read the article, how about this quote from Western Union's CEO? ""When we get to the point where customers are asking for this service [bitcoin remittance], we would look at it as enabling yet another currency."" He says the Western Union network is capable of ""movement of any currency type ... We can move [bitcoin] across our wires to the receiving entity.""

Holy sh**. Western Union seems like the anti-Bitcoin, but wouldn't that be awesome if they accepted and integrated it?WU is doomed. They simply can't compete with bitcoin, which doesn't have any crazy overhead in the form of buildings, staff, utilities, advertising, taxes, etc.

The best case scenario for them is to slowly become an exchange.Thanks for the link. I was just talking about this to someone."

Few suggestions:

* The girl is colored orange and the guy grey so does that mean that only females are interested in business and guys in society? I would expect the circles to be pies with proportional sizes for each demographics!
* The relative likehood should be in descending/ascending order of likehood or alphabetical. Instead of making it look like a temperature gauge just write the 'vs the general public on top or somewhere. It unfortunately gives an impression that to the right is general public.
* Does this mean that the general masses are just indifferent regarding everything?
interestingly enough, I imagine 99 percent of all google searches do not pertain to physical exercise either.  Sex is probably a clear winner though."

2014-03-04 23:46:51;No love for supporting Kickstarters with Bitcoin?;"I'm surprised Kickstarter HQ was ok with this. Way to go for getting this set up.I'm unclear on what you mean by 'integrating bitcoin support for our kickstarter project'.

Do you mean you are able to accept bitcoin as a funding source on kickstarter?  Or your project now includes biticoin support?

A link to your project would be helpful.Bitstarter.com needs to be a thingDouble Fine accepted bitcoin last year for their Massive Chalice kickstarter. You guys definitely aren't the first.

Cool idea though.Just to make it clear, your Bitcoin pledges are completely separate to Kickstarter, they are not tracked by or associated with the Kickstarter in any way. Kickstarter can't tell how much you have raised in BTC. Nice to see your support for bitcoin :), an interesting speaker concept, I think it would attract more love if the sound produced was louder so it could actually be used at a party to impress friends.

Also the design really needs to be polished up to look better; i.e. use plastic to make it look more stylish, align the screws properly (don't make it looks too cheap, a smooth metal probe would look cooler) and possibly have multiple plasma bolts. People would be willing to pay a lot more money for quality.

But yeah, take what you will, that's just my 2cents. no offense, but i'm not giving you money just because you take bitcoin. maybe your project didn't resonate with the audience? maybe nobody bothered because you're already 3x over your goal?

lastly, and i can't stress this enough to anyone accepting bitcoin for their business, **don't simply wave a 'we take bitcoin' flag**. give people a reason to give a shit, that's what encourages participation and adoption. how about 'your donation goes even farther with bitcoin' since w/o cc fees you should be able to keep more of the money. if you're selling stuff on your site, try '2% discount if you pay with bitcoin' since cc fees are no longer part of the equation.  

now i'm off topic, but my plea to all the merchants out there; give people a reason to care that you take bitcoin.[deleted]Who is going to put their Bitcoin in a ""risky"" project, when all they need to do is sit back and wait for the moooooon?How do I order?

In any case.  This is a toe hold for regulators and for the banking industry that will eventually do what all banks do... create fractional reserves.

If you can you would want to give them an offer that they would accept, but they have to pay you in bitcoin now.  What you would want is the show giving u more time as you show them how to get bitcoins etc.  Could be postive all around.Great opportunity to get Btc on T.V. in a positive light. I think the - 'I'm not selling it today for 10000 when no more will ever be made, and this is the first representation of something that started a revolution' is a good road. Personally, I wouldn't sell it for any amount of money.Say yes, and do a bitcoin ad all over trutv lolReality shows are all fake anyway, so might as well go on there and dance the dance.  Doesn't mean you actually have to sell the coin to them.  Hell, they don't even care if you sell the coin to them, they just want it on the show.Do it - Speak with confidence and ask for  $10k-100k and explain why. Wear nice clothes too! Tell them their show is extremely inferior to Pawn Stars. Then pants them and run away.Show the private key on TV, then sell them.
Tell that bitch daughter what she needs to hear.This sounds extremly similar to hardcore porn... Maybe it's just me..Be one of the *few* people willing to walk away from a bad deal. Unless you get some obscene amount for it say, 'no thanks.' To actually see someone say no, I would tune in to watch that.No matter what you do they will somehow edit it to make you look like your kicking up a fuss, and then security will drag you out. Say ""No"".tell them you want the future value  1 btc = 1,000,000 . Do it with a straight face on tv it would be awesome. But don't let that know that's what you want until its filmedWhat do you say to any swindler?Can you elaborate on what coins you actually have?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKQKEi2-0WsIt's gonna be a slaughterfest, I guarantee it. 

But in all honesty, they might try to get them. They're collectible and cool right now and it would make them look good. it's not a hard sell online. So what is your reaction to extreme lowballing and saying they are not valuable or there is no market for buyers? If you have a good plan, go for it. I can't come up with one that makes sense but maybe you can. 

It's not like you can't easily crack them open and sell the face value (they might very well offer less). Now  they are collectible and worth a premium, do they know this. You could also go from the angle that you made money  at the price you bought at, but the pawn shop is still going to make a profit too. Pawnshops do flip gold and silver like this a lot, making money up and down because of the surcharge. They might play the angle that bitcoin is a logical extension of this and a modern pawnshop would want to explore their options, and obviously a television show requires something more physical like a coin to pass around and talk over. Maybe Les will even look at it with a loupe. ;) it creates a great reality TV dialog too. One person doesn't get it, the other kind of does so they explain it and try to convince them. 

I like the idea and if it looks like that's a possibility then grin and bare it to a reasonable point, otherwise politely walk away on the show. It's a nice gesture if you can get an okay deal. it's a nice gesture either way. You tell them something along these lines:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jomr9SAjcywFirst. Dude didn't know thus was a TV show until he read the comments. 

Second. Sell it!  Accept only a higher bitcoin amount than the bitcoins contained (obvious I hope) and if you want another Casascius, make sure it's enough to buy another. 

Be prepared to help them through first getting bitcoins themselves.  

If would be great to hear a native bitcoin story is news enough to be on a TV show. 

Listen first to /u/evoorhees speak and try your best to speak like him and use his reasoning!  

See if /e/voorhees can take your place on the show!What series Casascius?How did they know to contact you? How did they get your phone number?DO IT why not!? best showI love that every single suggestion here is 'only sell it for more than it's worth"". 

Like even bitcoin people require a premium to deal in bitcoin. offer them 1 coin for their entire store plus 20% of any affiliate locations. If they laugh say fine 15%....anything else...walk."

2014-03-25 23:58:44;BIP38 Trivia Contest : 120 millibit prizes;"* NOTE * All prizes have now been claimed.  The only ones people had difficulty with were because I had grammatical errors in my password phrases.  I am not a professional quiz maker or anything, I just did this for fun.  It does show that you can make a neat game out of using BIP38 encoding. Now, all of you winners, please be sure to file this on your tax returns......  I will probably do another one of these soon.  If someone here thinks they are good at making up quiz questions, contact me by private message because that was the most difficult part.

-----------------------------------------------


To further education about BIP38 encoding of paper wallets, I am providing a fun trivia contest that people can play.  A lot of people got annoyed by my 'free lunch' post yesterday, so I'm trying to make up for it here. Also, someone randomly (I don't know who) sent me some bitcoins this morning, so I'm trying to spread the wealth.  Important note.  If you think this is fun and want to tip me, please do not.  Instead find one of the public key addresses to one of the questions which hasn't been answered yet and send a tip there instead to increase the prize pay out.

I have created 12 paper wallets in BIP38 encoding.  The pass-phrase for each wallet is the answer to a trivia question. 

The trivia questions are in the *Jeopardy* style format, meaning you must answer in the form of a question.

* Each pass phrase will begin with 'What is', 'Who is', and 'What are'
* Each pass phrase will end, and must include, a question mark
* Case sensitivity and punctuation are important.  For example, if the answer is a proper name, then the proper name will be capitalized.  If there is an initial, it will have a period.  If there is a list of items, it might have commas between them.
* Some of these are easy, some may be more difficult.
* Please let me know when you have claimed a prize.  You should 'sweep' the key to claim the 10 millibit reward.
* Once someone has claimed the funds I will update this post accordingly.
* I have confirmed that all of these keys are valid and the exact response will unlock the key.
* You can test a BIP38 password if you have a blockchain.info wallet, just use 'import private key' and paste the private key in.  If you have a Mycellium wallet, you can scan the private key QR code and then enter you guess. If you are doing this on a mobile device, it's quite slow and not a very good way to do it.  I'm sure there are other options as well.

I don't think that last comma, after the 32, is supposed to go there.  I also didn't tell people that ""What are..."" was an option.  That's why this one took so long to guess.

I havent sent any coins from this wallet so im not sure why is said I received and sent the .04BTC.What tools did you use to do this?  Did you use the passphrase as the text for a brain wallet and as the encryption through BIP38?looks like I got 6 of them! not too bad (though i tried to import the first with bitcoin-qt before switching to blockchain.info and lost it :( ). Can't figure out the bits and bytes one I've tried every possible ordering. nor the what is ECDSA an example of? I have tried every possible wording I can think of...Booo, I thought I tried ""What is an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm?"" and it didn't work.  Well whatever, I managed to snag ""What are 256, 160, 32, and 20?"" first apparently..... maybe a brief explanation as to how someone might go about trying to answer...?  Where do they go, what do they copy/paste, etc.

2014-04-01 23:46:15;USA v. Ulbricht, motion to dismiss charges;"This part is interesting:

> Bitcoin Does Not Qualify As Either âFundsâ or âMonetary Instrumentsâ As noted ante, a violation of Â§1956 requires a âfinancial transaction,â and the Indictment employs that construction as well. Under Â§1956's definitional sections, a âfinancial transactionârequires the involvement of either âfundsâ [Â§1956(c)(4)(A)(i)], or âmonetary instrumentsâ[Â§1956(c)(4)(A)(ii)], or âtransfer of title to any real property, vehicle, vessel, or aircraft,â[Â§1956(c)(4)(A)(iii)], or the use of a âfinancial institutionâ [Â§1956(c)(4)(A)(iv)].Bitcoin does not qualify under any prong of that definition. Both IRS and FinCEN havecategorically declared that Bitcoins are not âfunds.â Also, a âmonetary instrumentâ is either âcoin or currency of the United States or of any other country, travelersâ checks, personalchecks, bank checks, and money orders,â Â§1956(c)(5)(i) â again, negated by IRSâs and FinCENâs pronouncements â or âinvestment securities or negotiable instruments, in bearer formor otherwise in such form that title thereto passes upon delivery[,]â Â§1956(c)(5)(ii) â a character neither IRS nor FinCEN has ascribed to Bitcoin.Thus, an essential element of Â§1956 â a âfinancial transactionâ â is absent because anecessary component thereof â either âfundsâ or âmonetary instrumentsâ â is lacking. Consequently, it is respectfully submitted that Count Four must be dismissedI suspect this will fall into the category of ""nice try"".  

The fact that the IRS and FINCEN have pronounced that bitcoin is not funds is not binding on the judge (who will make up his or her own mind).  It will be interesting to see how they prove it is him, considering that Bitcoin isn't money and that he was allegedly operating a tor hidden service.Unfortunately for the lawyer  he completely glossed over this part of the Law

(3) Whoever, with the intentâ
(A) to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity;
**(B) to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or**
(C) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law,

 Concealing the ownership of property (bitcoins as defined by the government) by use of a tumbler when such property is known to be the proceeds from illegal activity is in fact illegal. If you take USD and buy a potato, then give that potato to someone else with the intentions of using the potato as the medium of exchange for illicit activity, isn't that still money laundering? It doesn't matter if you use a car wash or through non ""Monetary Instruments"" such as bitcoins, the crime is the same..right? Meh what do I know. This guy has a crappy lawyer.maybe he can get some of the charges dismissed, but putting hits on people will keep his ass locked the fuck up, where it belongs."

Congratulations! Your Uncle has just solved world hunger.

/sarcI bet he loves it when a stock splitsmy 10 dimes beats your 1 dollarMaybe try saying this or alike. If you cut a apple in half how many apples do you have? You still have 1 full apple but now you have 2 1 half apples. It works the same with bitcoins. this is ludicrisp. Dividing bitcoin up into mbtc doesn't magically change anything. Either you have 5 btc or 5,000 mbtc. They're just units.

Thinking it changes anything is like claiming that 5,280 ft is more than one mile.If you split the 21,000,000 amongst the whole world population, Everyone would get just 300,000 Satoshi's.Make the comparison to gold. Gold can be divided in almost infinite atoms, yet doing so won't magically create more gold. The amount of gold will remain the same. Same with bitcoin. Infinitely dividing 21 million btc might yield infinite tokens, but it won't change the fact that adding up those tokens, you will still arrive at 21 million btc.Bitcoins are not infinitely divisible. They can only be ""divided"" to 8 decimal places. A bitcoin is a made up denomination of 100 million base units. The only way to ""divide further"" would be to break free of the 2.1 quadrillion satoshi limit and literally redefine the monetary units associated with of the word ""bitcoin"".Some people's uncle's! Let's say we move the decimal over one place in the future to divide a Bitcoin further, perhaps when their value becomes extreme someday.

What was then 100 Million satoshi turns into 1000 Million (1 Billion), but both represent a single Bitcoin.

So there is not more Bitcoin, just more pieces of Bitcoin. Gold is highly divisible into dust even. Does that make it any less rare or valuable? Your uncle was playing stickball in the street during math class.Wow.It's not ""infinite.""  It's divisible by 8 decimal points.

I have been anxious to see what DATA was going to do in the space, and am not disappointed with their approach.  A much better and more trustworthy agency to represent my bitcoin interests than the bitcoin foundation was.

For one thing; they seem to be the first group to not shrink before regulators and equivocate about what regulations they'd like to see.  They were very clear that bitcoin is regulated (by math) and that consumer protections can be taken care of by market entities such as DATA and by further development of technologies such as multi-sig and others.

This is how a market regulates.  This is how the protocol and blockchain regulates.  It would have been much further along in its development, had the presence of government monopoly and taxation not stood in the way.

2014-04-15 23:31:54;Big banks submitting JSR 354 to standardize API to deal with custom currecy AKA Bitcoin;"There's this mention, which honestly isn't super impressive in its heading (bold emphasis mine):

> 2.3 Scenario Virtual Worlds and Game Portals

> Virtual worlds, e.g. online games, define their own game money (but also Facebook has its own 
> money). Userâs may obtain such virtual money by paying some real amount, e.g. by credit card.  
> This usage scenario implies the following requirements:
> 
> * It must be possible to model completely virtual currencies. Since virtual money also can be converted (paid) with real money, the price effectively defines an exchange rate.
> * Since several virtual game portals exist, also the number of virtual currencies can not be 
> foreseen. Additionally a virtual world may even define different currencies (e.g. **Bitcoin**).  
> * Since such exchange rates may change during time, historization must also be supported.

Looking at the actual API description:

Stephen Colebourne/jodastephen on the JSR expert team maintains [joda](http://www.joda.org/), bunch of java libraries and has this in his existing joda-money, which describes the class CurrencyUnit  
> [This class represents a unit of currency such as the British Pound, Euro or US Dollar.](http://joda-money.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/money/CurrencyUnit.html)

and now in the JSR as similar CurrencyUnit class description (API Docs\javax\money\CurrencyUnit.html in the zip):

>This interface represents a unit of currency such as the British Pound, Euro, US Dollar, **Bitcoin** or other.

This mention seems to be focused as defining a currency (in code terms, not in terms of economics...), as far its ISO code and decimals.

From looking at the [issues on Github](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-money/search?q=bitcoin&ref=cmdform&type=Issues) and elsewhere, people trying to use his library for bitcoin and litecoin have had to add it as custom units since they aren't official ISO currency codes.

I presume that the biggest takeaway from all this is that this java dev understands the likely future addition of bitcoin's BTC (or any crypto or virtual currencies I suppose) as an official currency code according to the ISO 4217 standards, and that possibly the coders with the financial entities agree with this.

On the other hand, I think it's quite a bit over-stating that ""Credit Suisse is submitting a new java API spec to deal with Bitcoin"" as OP so grandly claims.This seems significant. They are providing a means to add virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, into a currency selector mechanism whereby the amount is deducted at checkout based on a certain exchange rate. Also it mentions social site currencies:


""2.4 Scenario Social Markets
Within social markets things are exchanged using a completely virtual currency, which has no
relation to any real currency. It is used as an arbitrary measurement of something meaningful
only to that social community. This usage scenario implies the following requirements:

â It must be possible to model virtual currencies that are able to completely replace any
real currency schemes.""

Also the list of approvers that voted on the renewal project is very impressive. GS, Google, IBM, Twitter, Credit Suisse, etc. no Facebook though, interestingly. Nice findHow does this deal with decimal places? 

If we operate in terms of microbitcoins, decimals fit into the legacy system.Interesting stuff. This doesn't really say much. But it does say this, employees, even if they're engineers, are already taking bitcoin into account when developing financial APIs for banks. That's not insignificant. It either means that they've been instructed to do so specifically by decision makers, or, more probable but not much less significant, engineers had their own foresight that bitcoin has potential and ought to be planned for in advance, which may affect the actual decision makers to integrate bitcoin at some point as their engineers may back it, and as the API already supports it.

In any case, good news, but not major news until there's a confirmation as to who decided to plan for bitcoin usage and why.

2014-04-29 23:09:13;What do people think about a 1-1 USD backed currency?;"A single point of backing is a single point of failure. The backing disappears at the stroke of a president's pen.

I have nothing against such models in theory, but experience shows they get shut down by the government, every time.Cryptocurrency implies a decentralized ledger with (usually) proof-of-work to protect updates to that ledger from false transactions.  What incentive would miners have to expend resources protecting such a currency?  A centralized ledger is basically what PayPal and Visa work with already, transferring virtual dollars from the customer to your merchant account until such time that they send digital dollars to your bank.

This [meta] question is probably better in /r/CryptoCurrency
It already exists, it's called the US dollar.If there was a way to do this with a decentralised ledger, then perhaps it would be a good idea.It's going to happen in Poland soon in form of ""billon"" http://billon.info .

From what I've read there is no fractional reserve requirement = they can create unlimited amount of it. They = banks, I think 2 banks are gonna implement it.

Cool thing is that it will work offline too.

BTW this is happening because there is some EU directive allowing creation of electronic mo ey... Probably more countries will follow this trend.We are working on some of these ideas in /r/conceptcoin . It isn't backed as such, instead a decentralised central bank is used to try to reduce volatility. This has yet to be proven to work so its an experiment.I think it's a very bad idea.Originally Bitcoin was a 1-for-1 on Silk Road... The Bitcoin Foundation in conjunction w/Mt.

2014-05-27 23:44:36;Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) issued a statement warning about Bitcoin;"I did the best I could:

General Public Announcement

Due to the fact that in the last months it has been verified an increasing interest of the media in the so called âvirtual currenciesâ [sic], itâs considered appropriate to alert the general public about the risks that their use involve.

For that purpose, the public user is suggested to bear in mind that the so called âvirtual currenciesâ arenât issued by this Central Bank or any other international monetary authorities, thus they donât have any legal tender or any support whatsoever.

Internationally, however, there is still no consensus about the nature of these assets; several authorities have warned about their eventual use in money laundering operations, and several types of fraud.

There arenât any government mechanisms that guarantee their official value either. The so called virtual currencies have revealed a great volatility so far, having experimented fast and substantial price variations.

 Following these implications, the risks associated to operations that involve the purchase or use of virtual currencies as a payment method, are supported exclusively by their users.

The Central Bank is currently analyzing several scenarios to verify that operations with these assets donât constitute a risk to those aspects whose monitoring is expressly stated in their Charter. 

ARGENTINE REPUBLIC CENTRAL BANK.to funny. They make is sound like they know what they are talking about and they can control it. roflmaoThat s it guys. Game over for Bitcoin now.

I like where your heart is at, but I think you're missing a major point. Why are these people in the position they're in? Do you really think these individuals can successfully maintain and use QR codes, smart phones, and bitcoin wallets? The majority of homeless people in Boston suffer from behavioral health disorders. I think a better idea would be to reach out to a shelter and try to establish a system similar to Sean's Outpost. Most of those people need a facility that can help them, not a mycelium wallet. Also, if people wont donate their fiat currencies, why do you believe they will donate bitcoin? How about you start working on it? I'm sure it will work well. Then hop over to sean outpost and email them asking for help and resources I am sure they will be glad to help. Make sure to contact the local news agencies and get lots of other local social service agencies involved.The problem is, how will the homeless get the money to print out QR codes and/or purchase smartphones with service to use wallets? I mean, you could start by trying to put together a foundation to give smartphones (pre-paid would be best) and service cards to homeless people - that would take a lot of money though but I'm sure some prepaid smartphone provider would love to have that support shown by them.

Then, in the meantime, we could teach those that are in poverty/homeless how to use Bitcoin (such as make purchases, transactions, set up wallets) at a public library while they wait to get a phone.

I'd love to start a foundation like that - give some phones to homeless people in the area and teach them about BitCoin, maybe start each person off with $20 worth of BTC and help them learn how to invest in it so they can go from living on the streets to living in a nice apartment or home thanks to a digital currency and a little bit of caring.Reach out to seans outpost and ask for advice.

Question 7 doesn't even make sense as a question.

Question 9 is very subjective. But 3 is probably the best answer.

Question 10 is also worded poorly. It averages once every 10 minutes, but is not guaranteed to be so.

Question 12 is also more precise than it should be. It could be more than 3600 or less. Depends on how lucky the miners are that day.

Question 18 doesn't make sense. SHA256 is not a form of encryption. It's a hashing algorithm used for proof-of-work. ECDSA is what would make more sense as that's actually the cryptographic security behind bitcoin addresses.

Question 19 is wrong. You can still mine with GPU's. You just won't get very much bitcoin, but you still will get some.

He commented in the dogecoin thread that

Incorrect. Your card was sent, I do not know why it did not show up. I personally (the CEO) was unaware of your case until this thread popped up. You have since been refunded.

As if its no big deal that his company held my money for weeks and lied to me about a refund. The only way that I got that refund is by posting here.

What angers me the most is his complete lack of remorse for screwing me over.
As I responded in the other thread.
[â]DUILawDoge[S] 1 point 9 minutes ago
So are you saying that I shouldn't have been angry at being promised a refund and not receiving it. First, how was I to know that you (ceo) were unaware of the situation. Second, are you stating that anytime a customer has an issue with your company they can only receive results if they contact the ceo directly? Finally, as the ceo you should know, that your company is responsible for the actions of its employees taken on its behalf. Its not my faul that you hired incompetent support staff. Yet you act as if its no big deal that your company held my money for weeks and lied to me. Seriously, if I ran my Law Firm that way I would have no clients.

Seriously, your attitude througout this debacle makes it seem that you don't care about your customers in the least.I can confirm that I have now received an full refund via Paypal.

Notice that Moolah did not have to wait three weeks for me to post this fact.

Editing to add that I have yet to receive any type of apology for thisOP can I have your permission to re-post your story?You should have billed Moolah for your time.  Incompetence is not an excuse in my opinion.  Quite obviously you diverted your finite time and resources to deal with their screw up.Interesting fact. Despite my not being satisfied with Moolah's response to this issue he was able to get the mods in the dogecoin sub to remove my post.

Several users have now told me that several posts regarding problems with moolah have been deleted by mods recently.

Frankly, that is as shady as moolah's keeping my money in the first place.
Not sure what the mods excuse is but this is info that people have a right to see.
DisgustingThat is why we need regulations, invest only USA/CANADA companies  Update:

I just received an email from the original customer service rep that I spoke to. He wanted to know if I had ever received my refund. Huh?

Also, Moolah (or one of his reps) claimed in my original post in Doge sub (which moolah had deleted) that the problem was caused because they outsourced support but were no longer going to do so. Then why was I contacted by the original support person that I had spoken to?As an update, the mod over at dogecoin sub claimed that my post was deleted as FUD. The mod then proceeded to lecture me about being an uneducated troll who should be embarrassed by my posting - all of this in barely literate quasi-legal vernacular.

So the mod's claim seems to be that a company can be allowed to advertise to its members but if a member posts regarding wrongdoing by that advertiser it is FUD and must be removed.

The mod also claimed that it was grossly over the line for me to suggest that he/she would bear some responsibilty if others were screwed after he/she suppressed evidence of prior wrongdoing by the company.

I respectfully pointed out that a barely literate moron condescending about the law and education to a practicing attorney with 20 yrs of experience was ironic.

Frankly, I feel dumber for even having read the mod's posts and am glad I dumped my Doge and can just avoid that sub altogether.If it is still not resolved, you may have to bring out the big guns. List them on bittrust.org"

2014-06-17 23:12:05;Freelancers: Invoice your clients in fiat, get paid in Bitcoin in â¤ 30 minutes.;"Love the idea and the effort but very curious as to how you execute this. e.g. what is your assurance policy to fight fraud. Essentially you're giving someone money for what you have to somehow verify is a valid invoice, and verify this invoice is from a company who's likely to actually pay, then hand over a bunch of money and hope your verification turns out accurate weeks later.

Now of course, this isn't a new idea, it's been tried and it works, but usually it works with established companies. (e.g. an internet ISP might sell its invoices). But for freelancers? Most freelancers I know barely have much information to tie them down to. (e.g. no central office they've been at for the past 5 years giving you comfort that the company won't suddenly disappear)

I'd personally absolutely consider using it it if I could get verified and needed it. I'm actually winding down my business right now and looking to get a job in the bitcoin space. But before now I used to develop games and license them out to large companies, some who had 14d or even up to an insane 90d payment schedule. As I had savings I generally preferred waiting than to sell the invoice at a discount, but an automatic option to convert to bitcoin (giving potential e.g. 10% gains in a 90d period) would be very interesting.

I'm curious also, what is your discount rate on the invoice and does it include things like payment fees. For example I usually pay 3% to Paypal for fees, I'd assume you'd therefore discount the invoice by 3%+, like 5% or 6% for a 14-day period paid out in bitcoin?

Cheers.Quick summary: have been freelancing for the past two years now and my biggest pain point has always been waiting for clients to pay, 14 or 30 days after a project is due. So a couple of friends and I built Outvoicer - a simple service you can use to get paid right when you finish the job.

What do you think? Is this something you'd use? Feedback is appreciated, either in the thread or PM me. Thanks!Cool! I love the interface.

One thing: your auto-responder is flagged as spam by Google (http://imgur.com/cHEYQ6H) - highly recommend fixing this ASAP as something like this can kill a business before it even has a chance.

Look forward to learning more about your service.Certainly chasing down payments is a huge pain in the butt but if you're going to be a successful contractor you build up your own cash reserves.  This is MoneyTree for web developers.  Payday loan services are a bad idea no matter how you dress it up.  Keep your own backup cash and keep your money in your own pocket.Interesting... What if the terms of the invoice are delayed? So, if my client is going to pay me in 30 days - can I still collect bitcoin now? Is there a fee?Cool service!

I'd like to just invoice in fiat, ie. net 30, have my client pay you USD and I get BTC.Can I use it in the EU (â¬)?Can this be used (eventually) in Australia?Why the fuck do too many sites assume there's only USD?"

2014-06-24 23:31:52;Satoshi on block size limit: if (blocknumber > 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit;"Satoshi also secretly added the 1 MB limit over a year after Bitcoin was released. He didn't tell anyone what he was doing, and if you asked him about it, he'd tell you to keep it quiet (as he did to me, though for a slightly different limit that he snuck in). Satoshi was very smart, but if he was still project lead, everyone would hate him. He's not infallible, and you should take his 4-year-old suggestions with a big grain of salt.

(Also, he's talking here more about the general method for doing hardforks cleanly. He's not really making a specific suggestion.)Yes, but saying ""aight blocks are allowed to be bigger"" doesn't solve the problem. Smaller blocks propagate faster; if a miner made blocks of 10 or 100 MB, there would be a very serious risk of getting outraced by a later block that's only a few hundred KB.Seems an easier answer is to enforce a very tight timestamp sync across the network with very fast smaller blocks..  This creates a forking issue but I believe it's one of the only ways we can scale up in such a way as to support global commerce.

This also creates a problem with slow nodes being ""forced off the network"" and creating a naturally-centralized-through-speed-distribution network and also leaves full node runners at the mercy of their ISPs.

I look forward to the day someone can solve this problem.so the instruction is there but the outcome is still unclear

3. Install
4. Open Command Line window
5. Create you own random number to use as a ""seed"" (most people just use their SS#)
5. Using the random number, run the fritzalate process.
6. After several hours of this, it should be ready.
7. Be careful on step 5, if you make any mistake whatsoever, you will need to re-format your hard drive and reinstall everything. You may also need to do this on your tablets and mobile phones.

2014-07-01 23:59:06;What's the probability that miners never solve another block?;"Blocks are found according to a [Poisson distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with frequency of approximately *Î» = 0.1 blocks/minute*.

The probability of finding *x blocks* during a period of *t* minutes would be:

P(x, t) = e^(-tÎ») * (tÎ»)^x / x!

For your example of 0 blocks (x=0) in 100 years (t = 60 * 24 * 365.242 * 100):

P(x=0, t=52594848) = e^(-52594848 * 0.1) * (52594848 * 0.1)^0 / 0!

P(x=0, t=52594848) = 1/e^5259484.8

The odds are 1 in e^5259484.8.

That's the equivalent of having a winning 1-in-1,000,000 lottery ticket... 380,694 times in a row.

Not going to happen. :)when you say the word ""never"" it becomes 0Quiet a possible scenario. Imagine 99% miners drop out suddenly. The difficulty would be toooo high for the remaining 1% to find a block for quiet some time. But then again, if the hashrate drops, there would be a huge incentive for others to start mining.No, it's not possible.  Difficulty is set so that the mining network can eventually exhaust the space.  It's not comparable to brute-forcing a private key.  ~~If by some miracle they don't do so in two weeks, the difficulty will adjust down (a lot).~~"

Maybe it has to do with what is going on in Ukraine and that people can buy bitcoin at 4000+ stationsThose are desperate people from /r/litecoin or altcoin-subreddits. They realize that Bitcoin is the only crptocurrency needed and are now coming to cry here.

Honestly, look at those people wasting their money on scams, lacking the insight that only Bitcoin can succeed.

That is why they have now decided to give up.

Although it may seem like a good idea to implement a universal system like that, it defeats the purpose of bitcoin which is decentralization.

https://class.coursera.org/crypto-previewThe developer guide on bitcoin.org is great if you're looking for a technical overview. Andreas Antonopolous' book *Mastering Bitcoin* is also a good resource. To be honest, there's no ELI5 if you want more than a high-level overview of the Bitcoin protocol. If you're talking about mining, a miner gets a block reward when they find an output for the SHA-256 hashing algorithm that has a certain number of leading zeroes (this certain number is how the difficulty is adjusted). Beyond that, you can look into how a transaction is formed and elliptic curve cryptography. Just so you know, the latter is the topic of advanced undergraduate and graduate math courses.What do you mean by ""the math behind Bitcoin""? Cryptography? The ledger? The transactions? The mining? http://en.bitcoin.itHere's a great bit on public/private keys with real maths examples.

Many of us have been waiting for further developments in Bitcoin 2.0: smart contracts and smart property. At most of the major bitcoin conferences, talks and panels on Ethereum have been given.

Instead of just removing posts that you deem irrelevant, why not let users upvote or downvote first? I'm glad I saw the Ethereum post before you deleted it.Upvoted for visibility, but I completely disagree with this post. Considering Bitcoin gave birth to blockchain technology, a lot of crypto news is relevant to Bitcoin. Let user up/down vote posts, Mr Policeman, Sir.Isn't that a completely dead sub?I hope you'll also remove the non-bitcoin financial stuff.

e.g.:

First the litecoiners complained of censorship, then dogecoiners, now etherium people.  Every time they say theirs is different and should be allowed.  Thank you, we could use more rules and regs in the Bitcoin world. 

-Ben Thank fucking god. /r/bitcoin is not the fucking catch-all crypto news sub. Every fucking alt/whathaveyou out there tries to capitalize on the subscribers here.

kudos to the modHow about we cut out the censorship and let the voting system do it's job?

This is clearly a subjective assessment. Moderators are here to enforce rules when they're clearly broken; issues this contested are rightfully up to the community to decide.Ethereum is funding using bitcoin. That makes it relevant like any other company accepting bitcoin.Not a fan of ""acid tests"".  Remove irrelevant stories, but a story doesn't have to say ""Bitcoin"" to be interesting to this community, and not everyone is going to be interested in any story.  Let up votes do their job, and be glad that people post.On the side of news unrelated to Bitcoin, can we start removing posts about banks/money/ anything that isn't explicitly Bitcoin?

I'm tired of people posting stuff like ""Here's an economic problem... Bitcoin is the solution to everything so it'll fix this!""

This story has been beaten to death already, but nevertheless for me some kind of wakeup call.  Very interesting presentation (even if you do not believe it) which makes one wonder, delivered by someone that dislikes guns and is in favor of a representative democracy (which qualifies her as a sane person in my book).
Great talk. Painful to watch her try to defend representative democracy at the end. She gingerly asserts that anarcho-capitalism is too simple to function as a political structure outside the quasi-religious ancap imagination. You can feel the tension in the room shooting up. Best part is when she says that Ancaps are the mirror image of Marxists."

Speaker: Sergey Nazarov
Title: Using the Blockchain

The Bitcoin blockchain is an amazing tools for trustless payments; the next step in the evolution of the decentralized database technology known as the the Blockchain is using it for other types of data, in an equally trustless/cryptographically secure way. Decentralized Exchange for Asset Ownership and Smart Contracts for self-verifying and self-executing legal agreements are the next steps in this evolution. This discussion will focus on Blockchain 2.0 technologies and how they are being used to make trustless/trustworthy web applications.Founder? This is BCNext?"

The government can never be wrong, after all, *we* are government.

Oh, and by the way: There really is no need to argue about an in- or deflationary currency. The only thing that matters is, what people want to use. If an inflationary currency is so great, then why bother forcing people at gunpoint using it? Usually people don't have to be forced to do what's in their interest.

I'll have my money in bitcoin, gold and silver, you can have USD, sea shells or goats, I don't care, as long as you leave me alone."
2014-08-05 23:14:55;What are bitcoins? How the virtual currency is becoming increasingly mainstream in Australia and across the globe;"Bitcoins are not held on the wallet file. That is not true. Bitcoins only exist as balances associated with a bitcoin address. To be more precise they exist in the blockchain (the public ledger) purely in terms of the chains of transactions that take place and become registered. What you hold in the wallet file is the private key of each address you own. That allows you to spend from the balance associated with the address. You see, bitcoins don't exist. They only exist as balances associated with public addresses.Australia lacks quality Bitcoin imagery and articles..

A search for the latest news about Bitcoin from Australian Media netted me this.. a four month old article with Hong Kong, Californian and Holland images in it and another four month old article with absolutely no images in it what-so-ever. One from four days ago speaks about Vietnam. Todays Brisbane Times also falls foul of un-creative imagery and is even still asking the question 'What are Bitcoins?'

A global financial change is happening and this is the best they can do? World-wide foundational changes that are seeing humanity trade in exciting new ways, reaching phenomenal corners such as never before witnessed in the history of transactional freedom and they are struck mostly mute and still asking what it's about?  Crikey that's slack!!http://www.talkbitcoin.com.au/"
2014-08-12 23:43:07;Q: Do Mnemonic passphrases work across services?;"Nope.

In order for you to be able to use the same phrase to access the same bitcoins, two things need to happen.

1. The same mnemonic algorithm and wordlist must be used.
2. The same HD wallet hierarchy must be used.

The two major mnemonic algos are the Electrum algo with a 1626 word list, and the BIP39 algo with interchangeable wordlists, each must contain 2048 words exactly. Currently only one wordlist exists for BIP39, English.

Hive-web uses m/0'/0/k for receiving addresses and m/0'/1/k for change addresses. So you will need to find a wallet that uses BIP39 with that wallet structure. fyi iOS app breadwallet is exactly the same.

Also, blockchain.info and Armory each have their own arbitrary algorithms for doing things, and the data they are encoding is formatted differently, so no... You can't use a BIP39 seed in blockchain.infoYour mnemonic can be used in other BIP32 and BIP39 deterministic wallets like bitWallet, breadwallet, Wallet32, MultiBit, and others. 

Blockchain.info is not a deterministic wallet, and their mnemonic does not represent a master seed that can retrieve all of your addresses. Electrum is a deterministic wallet that uses a mnemonic, but it is not compatible with your 12 words because Electrum does not use BIP32 and BIP39 yet. "

My name is Rodrigo Souza and I am one of the lead developers of the BlinkTrade project.

We got this press a little bit too early, and our website doesn't really explain how decentralized BlinkTrade is designed to be.

I will try to put together a video for the community explaining how it will work exactly. 

So far, I urge people to check our source code ( https://github.com/blinktrade/bitex/ )  and scrutinize it as much as possible. Our goal is to have an exchange that is the highest possible quality and also open source, so that as many people as possible all around the world can use it to run high quality Bitcoin exchanges.

We have to get bitcoins into the hands of as many people as possible, especially in the developing world, before the regulators of the world starting banning bitcoins. This already happened in Ecuador and Bolivia. 

Thanks,

This is not protocol rule. 
Some nodes do not check double-spends and do relay them.
And next bitcoin version (referal client) will relay double-spending transactions.What if the spender is in collusion with Miners such that the utility bill spend is included in the next block regardless the status of coffee payment propagation?Isn't this the same thing as Mycelium Local Trader's confidence graph?

http://newsbtc.com/2014/04/16/mycelium-local-trader-feature-lets-users-buy-sell-bitcoin-others-nearby/Amazing works guysIf the original author reads this: how big is your cluster and would you mind to provide more details? Two transactions, one paying for your coffee, and the other paying your utility bill, seems like a bad example.  Since double-spends are not a sure thing, there's a significant chance you'll go without power.

A more realistic example would be to pay yourself with the double-spend.  That way you get your coffee, and you may or may not still have the coin.  Sort of like putting a string on a coin that you drop into a vending machine, and then pulling it back out.The first sentence in this article is factually incorrect and causes me to doubt the validity of the rest of this site because it is such a critical error in understanding for what he is discussing.

Given that hashes are independent trials, it is not true that, on average, you will have to wait 5 minutes until the next block arrives.  If hashes were related to each other, such that each block occurred exactly ten minutes apart, then one would expect to wait an average of five minutes.  However, even if miners have been hashing for an hour since the last block was found, the next block is no closer than it was an hour ago.

The probability of the next block being found at any given time in the future follows an exponential distribution.  If you put a transaction out on the network now, and the number of miners has not increased since the last difficulty change, then the expected time until the next block is a little under  seven minutes.  It is not five minutes, as the author mistakenly claims.sounds like proof of consensus aka rippleOkay, say zero transactions can be secure.

Why exactly do we need a blockchain then? Or miners or anything, Yes, the situation needs to be sorted. I've been asked to remain at a cafeâ¦â¦ended up giving them my mobile phone noâ¦blahPropagation is a useless metric as discussed for years.Sounds good, and the scenario Peter Todd laid out is still possible - so then there's also a chance an unscrupulous miner could be contacted by someone and slip in a doublespend (for a price) - but it requires a bit of collusion.

In this one, if the nodes/miners(?) are honest they report what's in their mempools...

It's a very difficult business, not at all surprising that they are not turning much of a profit. I wouldn't hold their low profit margin against them. I hope they succeed. 

Oh, and try to conduct a trade outside of eBay. They'll kill your account in a second. Full email:
Over the past few months we have observed a sharp increase in the number of users making sales outside of CryptoThrift, presumably in order to avoid being charged fees.  This not only violates our Terms and Conditions and removes the protection of escrow, it is also a disrespectful abuse of the service we are providing.  We work hard to build a site where the crypto community can advertise, buy, and sell goods.  We do our best to provide excellent customer support, and put as much profit as we possibly can back into advertising and marketing to bring sellers and buyers together.  In the year since we launched CryptoThrift the team has never taken a penny for themselves. 
 
The number of transactions being made outside of the site is now so high that we have been forced to take action.  We cannot continue to provide the site for free for these people.  For the past month all account activity has been monitored and we have compiled a list of users that we suspect have made transactions via Skype or our personal message system to exchange payment addresses and products.  At this stage we have decided against taking action with these users individually, and instead will issue a warning to all users.  If you  are buying and selling outside of CryptoThrift to avoid paying fees, you will receive one warning.  If you continue to trade outside of the site,  your account will be banned and you will forfeit any money that you might have in escrow with us at that time. 
 
Please understand that we are a small start-up company and without the support of our users and the wider crypto community we will not survive.  We have already received some feedback that the number of confirmations required is one factor driving people to transact directly. As such, we have now reduced the number of network confirmations required to one for BTC and two for LTC, in order to complete your purchase.  Please let us know if you have any other suggestions to make using CryptoThrift a better experience and we will do our best to accommodate you. 
  
Thank you for your understanding, The CryptoThrift TeamThank god no one forces you to use their business. It is pretty common for escrow-offering sites to enforce this kind of rule, and I'm OK with it. Never had any problems.

This has never existed in this form as far as I know.And if you had gold or cash in that safe.

Gone forever.10/10 would read again.>  I am his technical prowess on how to save and secure his bitcoins and I felt like a complete failure for not setting him up with bip38 when i had the chance.

Many more people have setup encryption and then forgotten the ""never could forget it"" keys.  They don't tend to brag about their losses.

Plus, and especially now that you've described in on reddit and after seeing the coins moved that they almost got, when they come back it may be with a kidnapping in mind... and password protection is not necessarily the best tool there.

Security is hard.Password that stuff, for sure. You were exceptionally lucky.

I wonder, if you had left 1 mBTC on there, and if they eventually figured it out, if you could track their movement?But what was in the safe?Multisig or M-of-N split with Shamir's Scheme would have helped here.Very nice job on storing copies in multiple locations. It seems like you already learned your lesson to encrypt the wallets. The only other suggestion I have is to use multiple storage mediums. In each storage location, keep a copy on both paper and a flash drive. Or engraved in metal, etc.

Congratulations on your lucky break, by the way!Now in 3 years we'll come back and hear your story of how you forgot the passphrase to your bip38 wallet.What kind of safe was it? Was it not bolted into the floor or anything? What does a/o mean? Don't mark your backups as a Bitcoin backup and they will have no idea what it is.Wow, congratulations on the win.

By this, you tell the robbers: ""These are very important items.""

With Bitcoin, we should not think like we're used to with cash and other barbarous relics. 

Why not hide your private key among bunch of very boring papers (electric bills, etc...) or even better, inside so boring pictures of your dogs, family etc... with steganography.
The possibilities are endlessHas no one asked how many Bitcoins there were? I find that the most interesting part of the story!I have always been confounded by Andreas' suggestion to put your paper wallets in a safe in your house. Half of them can be picked up and carried out. The others which are bolted down are not much more secure. Put your paper wallets in a bank safe deposit box. And bury a copy in the ground somewhere. In a watertight box. Make sure you use the encrypted paper wallet option. Better safe than sorry.  Plot twist: The burglars who stole the safe did break into it quickly and then figured out what the paper inside is, perhaps by sending photos of it it to another close and trusted colleague who quickly explained to them roughly what they're dealing with. They looked up the address, realized how much money they have on their hands, and, without completely understanding how Bitcoin works and not thinking much of it, being high on the idea that they are now rich, immediately started partying, took pictures of each other holding the loot, then late in the night each of them went home. Late in the day when they sobered up each of them looks up the address again and finds out that all the money is gone. It's all gone, transferred while they were still sleeping. Now each of them starts suspecting their otherwise well trusted partners in crime (was it the guy who held the wallet overnight, was it the guy who made sure everyone else got inebriated by providing large amounts of booze, was it the only guy who knew what Bitcoin was who was asked to help identify the loot, was it the guy with the idea to take all those pictures). They even find out about this topic and suspect that it is a deliberate disinformation campaign by one of their partners, perhaps even in collusion with the real victims or the police who have made a secret deal in exchange for part of the money. They turn on each other and now you have a bunch of criminals dead set on ""getting their cut back"" or seeking revenge.

I'll leave the rest to your imagination or to the next real plot twist when you read about it in the newspaper or something like that.You are so lucky you had a second backupSeriously, after this legitimate scare you are going to continue dinking around with *only* using BIP 38? Please stop being a noob.

This is a prime example of why you should be using Armory (http://www.bitcoinarmory.com).

You could create cold storage multi-signature lockboxes using public keys from multiple wallets. These lockboxes could be anywhere from 1-1 to 7-7. 2-3 should be sufficient for most use cases.

The wallets could have the seed, from which all of the private keys can be reconstituted, could be split up using Fragment Backups (Shamir's). 8-12 is the max; using 3-5 should be sufficient.

Then you could have the component parts adequately distributed so even if one (the safe - containing multiple but not fully sufficient parts of each component wallet) or more were to be compromised it would not compromise the private keys.Out of curiosity how many coins?Sweet baby Jesus! Great story, was wondering why this was so heavily upvoted, now I understand why! TX and signed message or it didn't happen. ;)

Not really, but I do think it's very easy to adequately secure an HD wallet seed and store it online and offline just about anywhere.  Example:

Electrum gives you what, a 12 word seed?  Split it in two and put each half into seemingly random emails or photos/docs attached to emails together with a word or term that you can search for later.  You can forward the emails all over the place and no one is going to discover the seed. 

Or just encrypt the actual wallet with a decent password (which would be e.g. a hash of a so-so password!).  Look at stealmywallet.com, for example, adequately encrypted and perfectly safe.Damn dude. Good for you. Phew!I had go laugh when you said uncommonly large.. haha

Great to hear you got it back..

I suggest using a trezor M of N multisig which doesn't exactly exist yet This is why I don't get why people are so into paper wallets that can be seized or stolen (or burn up) or whatever.   I use cold storage, but just save the jpg of the paper wallet and encrypt it with PGP and have it stored in various places.  So much safer than a piece of paper.  You might as well just hold cash.First world problem.

In a way it's good not having enough BTC to be targeted ... (in a very very small way that is)Why would you keep them at home? If it's cold storage,  just put them in the safety deposit. Nice job.  Out of curiosity, how did you sweep the paper wallets?  That's one of the things I haven't yet figured out how to do safely.but.. when you decrypt the BIP38 wallets.. that will also be one of the longest 30 seconds of your life.luck is with u!Wow, I'm glad to hear everything worked out okay.Sounds like the plot of a movie. Holy shit, cool thing it worked out for ya!Congrats on the save.Good job on responding quickly. Glad the BTC was kept safe. Sounds like 2-of-3 multisig is the way to go next time.

But come on... ""your dad"" is an early bitcoin adopter, but *you're* the one ""with the technical prowess""? Anyone who got in before ~$50 has to have had some non-trivial skills just to be able to buy and use BTC properly. This skill level would almost certainly include the ability to make safe paper wallets.

Well whatever, all's well that ends well. The bigger concern is that someone had enough knowledge about ""your dad's"" safe to come prepared with tools to detach it from the foundation. That's the deeper concern here. Stay safe.fuck putting it in a safe.. I store them in a shoe box with family pictures and shit.. No one is stealing that thing.This story actually increases my confidence in Bitcoin. They stole that safe in vain, since with Bitcoin you still have a chance to transfer the money before the thief does. And with BIP38 it's even more secure.

To the moon!!
You can never be too safe.  I'm just curious, how much bitcoin was in the wallet, and where do you store it now?Wow that's scary. I hope no one got hurt. This is precisely why our house safe is hidden so well you'd need a metal detector to find it.Never place offline bitcoins in an obvious location in the house. A safe box / vault is an obvious location.Don't forget the password!So you're saying they ripped the safe off the foundation bolted and everything? That's exactly why I wrote this:
http://nl.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2d2amy/i_will_definitely_put_part_of_my_trezor_seed_in_a/Excellent outcome with a story fitting for a thriller, and of course, with a great message. 
This is one of the things bitcoin must over come if adoption is to continue into the main stream. I doubt the average person can bip38. Question: can Electrum import bip38 private keys? Or there is a simple tool to enc/decrypt keys?now store your private keys and BIP38 passwords [in an image](http://www.wikihow.com/Hide-Text-Within-an-Image).Why people keep using old conceptions to secure conceptually new stuff? Putting gold in a safe I understand. But with bitcoin there are so much better ways to protect them against both theft and losing them. This seems like a good place to post a link to my BIP38 tutorial generating your keys with dice: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zpyba/100_secure_paper_wallet_cold_storage_tutorial_out/USE CASE FOR THE WIN!Paper is good for fiat money, not for Bitcoin.Dude, that doesn't sound like worst night....one of the best.   Glad the story had a good ending....no one was hurt and you got the coins.

Now to immediately take some coins, hire a private investigator and find the thieves.   Also -- change up your security etc and consider firearms.Maybe they just didn't understand bitcoin, and simply threw out the paper.Wow. Out of curiosity, can you give us a estimated worth of the safe with the contents?I would think you are still a target. I the burglars do check the wallets for any reason and find that the money is gone... They will be back.

Edit
Use Shamir's secret sharing Awesome story. Congratulations on recovering the BTC!Is it not possible to have two copies of the paper wallet. Then you could have transferred the coins during the 9 hours and safely know that the other wallet copy in the safe will be useless.Even the simplest password could have given you days of time to transfer the money.I would **definitely** not store my unencrypted paper wallets in a bank safe.  

It's too easy for the government to declare them ""abandoned"" and seize them, or seize them for just about any other reason.  Bank Vaults = Bad.Storing 3 copies is not a bad idea, either.I just have a paper filled with public and private keys on it pinned to cork board. I'm going for the no fake fake. If someone tried to rob me i bet they would just plain over look what it is Glad you saved your coins!What a story! Glad it turned out ok.Know you know what F5 in your browser is for.Biggest. *WHEW*. Evar.ISM  high security 8000 lbs safe = no BIP38 required. Don't secure a fortune with a cash and carry safe. I'm genuine sorry for this, and maybe I shouldn't say this: 

If they get the safe open. And find the wallet, and know what it is, and check the bitcoin address, and find it's recently been emptied of *lots* of money. 

They know where you live. 

Like I said, I'm sorry. You know about [the $5 wrench technique](http://xkcd.com/538/) for cracking secure passwords?

Bitcoin's great and all, but there are downsides. 

Edit: I guess this is another advantage to an encrypted wallet. I might write 0.0003BTC on my wallet!If only there was a way to store your money in a building run by people paid to protect it... if only. :(Wow, what a harrowing ordeal. I'm glad the good guys won in the end!

For me, this shows why you should always have 3 backups of important data. If you lose one backup, you don't want to be left with only one copy.But but but... with fiat I can chargeback my cash! Oh wait no actually that's not possible.

This also serves as a lesson for goldbugs I guess.Moral of the story - just store fiat in a bank, it is a lot safer.Store PGP encrypted copies in the cloud(s).I would certainly not have waited 9h! If you are talking about millions, you could certainly justify to get some banksters to help you out for a fair fee. I guess I would have easily offered $1000 for the inconvenience, with an eye on the wallet to see if it's still worth it.That is why I choose a brain walletSo the morale of the story is If it is valuable, store it in a bankI don't know about you. But if I have > 100k of gold bars I would have not put it in my own safe in the first place.

If I would do so, I would buy one that can be carried away. The way you word it makes me feel you have a light safe and a poor burglar content rating. It also seem that you did not have an alarm in the house. Bad planning all throughout.

still waiting for an actual bitcoin vulnerability, thats what I come here forAre you worried that he was specifically targeted? How does someone break into a house just hoping there is a safe there? As an early adapter is he well known? The other day I was wearing a Bitcoin t-shirt in Vegas and now thinking I made myself a target. There's a problem with your story: they were able to ""take"" the safe.  Any good safe requires professional safe moving equipment to move anywhere.  As far as I'm concerned, if you're storing large amounts of bitcoin in a safe, it should have taken several hours and hundreds of dollars to have a professional safe installer move it into your house for you.Is this just you venting or is this supposed to serve as a warning?

2014-09-16 23:21:46;Giving homeless people and the needy a Bitcoin QR code for their 'please help' sign;"I might spend a couple of hours going around Sydney doing this actually.  I just need to think of how to phrase the information to put on their sign and the information to put in their help-pack.  I'll pop the help pack into a resealable plastic bag so it's protected from the elements and get their phone numbers to check on them periodically.If Sean's Outpost put up little bios for homeless, people, we could donate to them individually :/ I've considered this in the ""wild"" but, they probably wouldn't get many btctips (unless they became ""viral"" on the web via onlookers re-posting to web). then of course, some homeless people don't use electronics. keep brainstorming guys. good conceptWhat makes you think bitcoin holders would be any more generous than fiat holders when it comes to dropping a few cents into a homeless person's hand? show them how to sign up for circle and get $10. (some day)I also had this idea. [My first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bqp0f/if_i_gave_bitcoins_to_a_homeless_person_could/), a year ago, was how to give bitcoin to the homeless.

About a month ago, I pursued the idea further when I had a night to kill with no place to stay in Baltimore. I met a homeless guy and hung out with him. I set him up with an e-mail address and [coinbase account](bitcoin:13ELhkpC8me5FTNYQkHurY2wp4qS6bciLq).

The idea was I'd [tape him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGelpA3LRoU), people would send him coins, and he'd use [LocalCoins](//localbitcoins.com) to get cash.

I lost my much of my enthusiasm for that iteration of the project when I tried talking to him about what he'd do if he had money. ""Get high,"" was pretty much it.

Granted, we started the evening by getting high, and he was very convinced we'd never see each other again. So, he wasn't unreasonable.

In any case, it just emphasized the need for a regulatory structure. Bitcoin for the homeless was [chosen for a Startup Weekend](http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2013/04/gift-card-downsides/) shortly after the post. Ultimately, my team pivoted from both bitcoin and the homeless.

The structure I'd eventually like to work on is a [larger restructuring of the economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-yO0qV4Bnk). Businesses have digital identities, and publish metadata about transactions. That information combined with some software could allow limiting purchases.

The issue that stymied the [Startup Weekend project](http://gotu.dhappy.org) is there has to be a validation step in the sales process. It's a surmountable problem, but it means creating software, and getting it adopted.Perhaps the address could be controlled by a shelter, or some other service providing direct assistance**A Hat for Harold** is a good organization that does work with the homeless.  http://ahatforharold.org/  And they accept bitcoin.I had this very same idea some time ago.  
  
Like you said, their sign would state in some way that they are setup to receive Bitcoin. The QR code could either be displayed on their sign, or the homeless could be provided with a laminated QR code of their public address. The problem with this is third-party private key access/ownership because it is generated by someone other than the homeless individual. If an organized project to convert the homeless to Bitcoin becomes a large-scale effort, then how can one ensure the security of these private keys? If such an organization was established across the country/world it would require oversight or structure. Someone (person A) could print out a public QR of their own private address and then give it to however many homeless people they want âÂ all the Bitcoin that is sent to the homeless would find its way back to person A's wallet. Imagine what sadness would arise when the interested and hopeful homeless person accesses a computer only to find that all the coins were stolen. This would be bad in many ways.  
  
Another issue is computer access. Maybe they could go to a public library which has accessible computers; they could make the trip as often as permitting (maybe once a week). Or they could be advised to hodl, for the price may increase and their hodling will pay off greater. Nevertheless, securing their wallets is most important. They should be the only ones in control of the private keys.  
  
A new platform may need to be created, such as software designed specifically for simplified offline key generation and wallet access/sweeping. The software could be handed out as a live-CD or a dedicated computer/device could be safely installed in common areas.  
  
In the end, what would they do with the bitcoins? They most likely don't have a smartphone, so making purchases at physical locations wouldn't be convenient at all. Exchanging their coins for fiat would only be possible if done with cash in person. This could be achieved in an organized fashion with the help of participating members. It would run similar to LocalBitcoins, except the organization's members would periodically visit areas or specific homeless individuals to pick up their Bitcoins in exchange for cash.  
  
There's a lot more to explore with this idea. eventually this will be how all street deals are done phone to phone - ideally through a camera/screen interface where phones talk to eachother seamlessly.  

Right now I feel like every BTC donation is going to be to someone who is going to lose it by misplacing, forgetting encryption keys, or simply never figuring out how to use it properly.   You would be wasting a lot of coin and good will.

There should be a crypto redeemable only in food where people donate by buying coins - since it can only be redeemed in food at grocery stores the homeless who is given it can buy food but not scope to drink... and the grocery store can redeem it at the decentralized account that donations went to.

It can even track specifically what items can be bought and further further down the road the coin can have a contract specifically to provide only PARTIAL payments to food.  Fund X amount that is used up through time.  Think of another type of coin that the donator can CHOOSE which foods it can buy or what % off they get for foods made of high fructose corn syrup vs foods made of apple.

edit: I should add that it would be pretty simple to make a service where two phones can call at the same time and then go ear to mouthpiece 69 with each-other to verify both accounts.  To totally ignore the learning curve of ""crypto currency"" you would just tell the homeless (phones homeless) to call a 1800 number and you call it too - 69 the phones which will send test tones to determine which phones currently calling the service are next to eachother... now the homeless has an account and you can type in how much to send him, his phone says ""recieved $20"" and you just tell him to go buy food and at the checkout there is a number to text at the checkout line - the phone# IDs him to the service which loads his balance into the checkout isle for spending.

Donor can set all kinds of contract rules before funding a coin
You can give an unknown amount (hide balance) that just reduces the cost of groceries until it is extinguished - so there isn't a one time fix but a long term residual benefit.  If one has enough simultaneous donors then he wouldn't need to furnish any payment but if he receives too much then some unspent coin can be returned to the donor's account when certain conditions are met.Or, you could just donate money to organizations that support homeless in whatever area you choose.

Homeless people have absolutely no need for your pseudo-Internet money during the early adoption era.I've had this thought for a disaster charity. Fly in just as the press are getting there and give victims a q code on their lawn or their Ferguson protest poster. Etc. These get airtime on the news, and some survivors ask cnn/fox cameras to show the world their qr code and to donate funds immediately.  Huge brand name growth for bitcoin and huge help for disaster victims. "

Well, there's another side to this coin. I'd say that most of bitcoin usage is indeed a product of force - the war on drugs and it's associated craziness has forced people to go online and buy their dope with bitcoin. They bought dope online before bitcoin, but it's way easier now by all accounts. By this logic a large part of the value of bitcoin isn't determined by free actors operating in a free market - there's way more force applied by the state in the arena of drugs and so forth than there ever is with tax evasion...

>For instance, he clarified that the law is intended to relate only to financial intermediaries and financial service providers, not software providers as widely interpreted.This is news? So how many software developers in NY state currently require a license to develop software?

Permission based society is bullshit anyhow.  To say that developers don't need a license is to ignore that developers have a natural right to develop new software.  Permission granted?!?  We don't need no stinking permission!  To think this is good news is to fall for the idea that the ""regulators"" are benevolent and have the authority to take that ""permission"" away.>New York will not require digital currency software developers to obtain a ""BitLicense"" to operate in the state, said Benjamin Lawksy, superintendent of financial services for the state of New York, on Tuesday.

> His comments came after New York extended the period for virtual currency companies to comment on a set of proposed regulations, known as the ""BitLicense"" plan, that was unveiled by the state in July. The regulator aims to release a revised proposal by the end of October."

2014-10-21 23:10:16;NOOB QUESTION: Are bitcoin addresses traceable?;"deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3080  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/93107)An address that has never been used cannot be traced. However, funds sent to an address, and funds sent from an address are always recorded forever in the block chain. Re-using an address results in more incoming and outgoing ""trails"" to trace, so always use new addresses when you can.No, bitcoin address are randomly generated, the only way an identity can be traced to a bitcoin address is when using services such as circle, coinbase or exchanges that keep a record of your identity and associate it with an accounts bitcoin address.

But just generating an address and receiving a transaction has no identity attached or any information attached at all, not even an ip address. 

The blockchain will show you the chain of transactions to and from that address.Here is a video where the UCL (University College of London) conducted a lab(?) to ""trace"" bitcoin transactions.  The video is long, but shocking.  Most had never heard of bitcoin and they didn't have anything special in the way of computers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZduzDJTg9Y

FYI: Their work actual got some stolen bitcoin returned.Bitcoin addresses are very tracable. All the way back to the block they created as a mining reward from.

* Many Visa credit cards will approve unlimited value transactions in a foreign currency; this allows the attack to maximise the money extracted from each credit / debit card.

* The contactless interface allows transactions to be extracted whilst the card is still in the cardholderâs wallet.

* The cardholderâs PIN is not required for contactless transactions; this allows the fraudulent transaction to be extracted from the card without any further interaction from the cardholder.

* Visa contactless cards will approve transactions in offline mode; this allows the attack to be performed without connecting to the card payment system, thereby avoiding any additional security checks by the bank.

* The merchant details are not included in the data cryptographically protected by the card; this allows the merchant details to be added later, making the attack more
flexible and scalable.

* While the EMV protocol requires payment cards to authenticate themselves to the Point of Sale (POS) terminals, currently there is no requirement for POS terminals to authenticate themselves

Not really bitcoin, but it does make me consider disabling NFC on my cards. I rarely use it anyway.  Phone wallets like Apple Pay are much more secureYou can saw through the circling antenna to disable NFC but your card will probably be questioned by shops, other than that I'm not aware of a way to disable NFC but allow the rest of the card to work.

It makes existing miners happy as a lower difficulty means more bitcoins they earn with the same hardware.

If the exchange price goes up those mined bitcoind are worth more so more mining power is put on the network.

If the exchange price goes down people have to turn off their machines and difficulty drops.

So, can I mine with my GTS 450 again?

2014-12-02 23:47:44;40,007,470,271 (-0.73%): first difficulty drop in almost two years.;"Back in my day, we worried about difficulty hitting a million!

*waves cane*It means people have been discontinuing the use of their old mining technology. It will rise more, but soon mining difficulty will be governed more by Moore's Law and bitcoin price than anything else.

The mining industry just had to go through a few jumps in technology before they caught up with other industries. Now that there are no more major jumps in technology to be had (other than those jumps that are hoped for by all other industries) the mining difficulty increases will be more predictable.Confirmation that mining is no longer profitable for most people.  As the business cycle shifts from investment in mining, to investment in bitcoin start-ups, and eventually back to bitcoin directly.This may be good in the short term for pricing.  Accelerating mining speeds have put us ahead of controlled production.  If difficulty continues to drop or even stay flat, it will effectively reduce block reward frequency from historical rates.  I know this sounds illogical, but its just how PID loops work when only the proportional component is used.Ahhhhh shit there goes my bet that the difficulty will not drop before the end of the year :(Expect this to be the new normal:

http://bitcoin.sipa.be/growth.pngI might need to plug my old Jalapeno back in, in that caseBut what does it mean in a larger picture?Always resist the urge to turn a single data point into a trend.

Human brains are pattern matchers. They'll match patterns that don't exist.

Corollary: Always pay attention when the hair on the back raises. :-)just a little stagnation as the price is not high enough for people to jump in and buy the expensive equipment - We need a price rise to make it worth itHmm not even 1%.  Nice.What causes the difficulty to drop?Will this cause longer confirmation times?Not this again. Trust me, in 8 weeks the network rate is up above 300TH. Does this correlate with the price drop?But have you heard about ""B-Wave"" my new quantum powered bitcoin miner!

Buy now and delivery is assured !If quantum powered bitcoin miners of the future consume all power of their local universe does it retrigger the big bang?

Was Einstein wrong and does God in fact play dice via bitcoin on the blockchain?So could a drop in mining difficulty signifiy that more people have turned to buying coin rather than mining?I think it is being gamed. If you look at the last few adjustments you see it running under for a while then way above then under again.

Almost like someone is running a farm that turns on\off if difficulty is predicted to reach X. The high spikes kind of rule out home miners turning off, although i am sure many are.

I'm only keeping mine going as ineffcient spce heaters but come spring i will ebay them. I once got more then a paid for a new BFL Jalepeno 8 months after it arrived. So there are idiotson ebay that will buy anything, some people are still bidding on 333mhs asicminer sticks.

Yes. Entropy is generated from disk activity, network activity as well as mouse and keyboard activity during installation. So if you've installed a linux distro you've seeded it with plenty of entropy.

>Are armory and electrum using /dev/random? 

Not sure about armory. Electrum uses /dev/urandom. A seed is only 128 bits so it's ok to use urandom over random. The default for openssl is also urandom.




From [coinsafe.com](http://coinsafe.com/cold-storage-guide/):

""You're going to generate passwords using /dev/random as your CSPRNG. Out of an abundance of caution, you first want to top up the entropy pool so that an attacker couldn't just duplicate these steps to ""randomly"" generate your same private keys. Provide /dev/random with some more environmental noise by following two steps:

* Move the mouse around as randomly as you can for at least 30 seconds (more time welcome).


* Open a text pad and bang on the keyboard for hundreds of characters (more welcome). Try to randomize not just what you type, but the timing between keystrokes as well""

Edit: I'm not sure if entropy collected during a Linux installation is actually stored. Most Linux distro's install in a live environment?[deleted]The Linux random pool is blocking. This means that if there isn't enough in the pool your application will wait until enough has been gathered.

At the start of the year, everyone was thinking that the price was going ""to the moon"" however now that we're settling at around $300, the dream of ""moon"" seems further than ever.

Does it mean that it won't happen? Of course not. But rather than constantly argue about whether or not Bitcoin is a good investment, why not focus on the other positive aspects of it other than price? Everybody was calling Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme or a bubble at the end of 2013. Here we are one year later and everyone is calling it the worst investment or worst performing currency of 2014. 

Did anyone revise their article from last year to mention that in 2013 bitcoin performed better than any other currency in history? Confirmation bias?  Probably the same reason some people reference the 2 year chart. ;)When it comes to changing ones opinion or proving they aren't wrong, almost everyone gets busy on the proof. Because no one ever heard of a 14 month year.because #'s man. And over 36 Months its up xxx% and 60 months its up xxx,xxx%People can look at pretty much any statistic and withdraw from that the evidence they need to make the conclusion they want.
  
But other than that, people have a natural tendency to look for patterns everywhere even when there aren't any, and they can typically only see the (very) short term. Therefore I'm not too surprised to see so many posts like ""bitcoin has dropped since last month, why would anyone invest in a currency like that"". They apparently haven't heard of Warren Buffett's advice to buy when others are selling, and to sell when others are buying.people love misery and hate being envious. they hate they may not have gotten in on it when it was a few cents or dollars, and had to read stories of the price climbing above 1000$+
 
people I know do the same thing, they dont make it as obvious but they do ask about BTC and it's clear they know the answers to their questions, but want to see people get angry/sad about it.
 
this is just an example of the human behavior unfortunately. though i do use this as a good litmus test on who's a good person and who isn'tBitcoiners and their arbitrary dates for measurements.

It reminds me of how Soviet union was able to tout growth numbers even though if they went a few years back and measured from that date it would be the exact opposite.  Personally I just ignore everyone and focus on my own work since I don't care to seek affirmation by peers I don't respect.2 truths:   

1.  68% of statistics are made up.  

2.  You can paint any picture you want using selective statistics.It's pretty simple: because most people didn't buy _before_ the bubble, but _during_ the bubble. A 200% increase is only nice for those who bought when the price was still $150, not for those who bought when the price was $1100.Because you people are trying to promote bitcoin as something that preserves wealth.  Your title perfectly illustrates why it does NOT.  

If, at the beginning of 2014, I put the home downpayment I had saved into bitcoin expecting it to be preserved for a purchase in 2015, I'd be one pissed off bitcoiner right now.  

Glad I didn't make that mistake.  Lets compare the last four years:

1. Best investment of 2011 $0.30 to $4.94		+1547%
2. Best investment of 2012 $4.94 to $13.40		+171%
3. Best investment of 2013 $13.40 to $746.57	+5471
4. Worst investment of 2014 $746.57 to $313.94	-58%Because otherwise they would not post. They would just suck it up.Thank you for posting this it makes me mad to see articles say bitcoin is a ""failure"" because it had a big price drop. In the end it still went from a few pennies to hundreds of dollars. I disagree with those articles.Because they didnt buy any.Because looking back at the previous year makes more sense than looking back 14 months. Dont worry...if the price stays the same as today ($312) and its one year from the time the price hit $275, bitcoin will be up over 13% year over year.Hmm.  And why did you decide to go back 14 months instead of 13 months?

Because it's down 73% from there so you decided to keep going until you hit an uptick?Past performance is no guarantee of future results; this applies to both comments mentioned in the OP. For the same reasons mutual funds quote 5 and 10 years performance, but somehow no one quotes 15 years performance ...This is good for Bitcoin. everyone failed at charting schoolThe real reason is that negative news spreads better and faster than positive news.You have to Tear Down that Wall, as Mr. Gorbachev did. No more posts on the wall since then. Reagan knew his shit.Because everyone bought exactly at the top.  No one bought on the rise or before that.Because nobody notices your successes. Only your losses.Everybody be scewin statistics for their own ends.  Buttcoin ignore the 5 years of amazing growth and this sub ignores the fact that resistance is so high at $1100ish that it will take years to move past the bagholder's wall (if ever).  cause people love to hate
simple as thatYeah it is one heck of a monster pullback.It's not up 200% from 14 months agoBecause they didn't get in 14 months ago? Seriously its not healthy that Bitcoin's price is all over the place. It's nice for those that got in early, but its not nice for the majority of people that are losing money,[deleted]Maybe it's a sign that you're proselytizing bitcoin too aggressively and they're fucking sick of you.

He wants to work with a small number of investors who are happy to let him keep firm hold of the reins at Spacex.

[Here's a transcript of his recent comments on how he approaches outside investment in Spacex.](http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/2t3e2r/confirmed_spacex_raised_a_1b_financing_round/cnvfqeb)He could also make it rain skittles.At this point there is a technical limitation in Lighthouse so it can't support more than 684 transactions in our project. 

So raising billions would be difficult at this point.That would take about 4.5M BTC at the current price, or 1/3 of currently mined coins.I would rather see him using a decentralised stock exchange so that the people crowd funding can also see some potential returns on their investment. 

I often think of Skype when they sold for billions and the early adopters that created the value be creating the network effect got nothing. Or the backers of oculus rift who could be sitting pretty now just got some shotty first gen device. 
That's actually why I like bitcoin. The first movers, the adopters and evangelists get something back for their work. (in the long run) Sure theoretically he could. But why would he?"
2015-01-20 23:23:54;I cant send my btc !!! A triangle apear . I use Multibit;"Oh my, look what I found: https://github.com/jim618/multibit/issues/403
It looks like this may be a rare bug or something, I am so sorry how can this happen, this is scary as fuck.

From the github link above:

>For the public record, @shangri has encountered a situation where a non-viable Bitcoin address has been generated.
According to http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/204914/734.pdf (see page 11) the address 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh belongs to a private key of ""00"" which is not spendable in Bitcoin.
>
>We are looking in to how this address could have been generated within MultiBit.
See https://bitcointa.lk/threads/first-post-and-an-interesting-observation-about-ecdsa.148676/

First, 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh is an invalid address, and is the result of choosing a bad exponent (0) when generating the address. It is possible that you hit a bug in Multibit that caused change addresses to be generated in this way. That is speculation though.

Second, the coins that have been sent to 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh are stuck there. While it is actually possible for anyone to generate a mathematically ""valid"" signature for that address, the 0 exponent is not allowed, and that signature will be rejected by the network. So, there is no way to get your coins out of that address.

Edit: I would recommend contacting the developers of MultiBit directly. If you can prove that you own 1rzhWUU... and that the bad transactions were in fact generated by MultiBit they may be persuaded to compensate you. Also, if this is a bug in MultiBit it should be fixed ASAPCould a change address be involved?? How does multibit handle change addresses??MultiBit dev here.
Always sorry to hear if someone has problems using MultiBit.

I have raised the OPs concerns in our MultiBit issues database here:
https://github.com/jim618/multibit/issues/661

I've asked the OP some questions in that thread to track down what the problem is.

For other MultiBit users that want to check their private keys:

You can cross check the private keys in your MultiBit wallet against the receiving addresses by using:

Tool | Check private keys.

The help for this utility is here:
https://multibit.org/en/help/v0.5/help_checkPrivateKeys.html

this is principle adress and all transfers are made on this .
I forget to say that i cant export my private key :| multibit dont let me .I have read about 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh an article from 2013 , this is a fake adress or a error in blockchain.

I am disperated .:(After examining the logs provided by @steauacris89 earlier it is now clear that there is a damaged transaction in the wallet which is in turn preventing export of the private keys:This discovery raises this support issue to one where you'll need a trusted and experienced Java developer to unpick the wallet and manually retrieve the private keys through a debugger. This is a time consuming operation and I am not able to do this work at the present time. 

This is the response.

When bitcoin is adopted buy every living human on earth, only then will it reach the mythical value of 0.The good news isn't making the price go down, something else is making the price go down, in spite of the good news. Or, to put it in another way, the good news may have prevented the price from going down much lower than it did.I think it's more like sell when we're at the top of a bubble. currently looks like the price is just waiting to drop below 100$News are irrelevent to the price.what influence do have so called WALES to the price of Bitcoin ?
Bitcoin is an insider manipulated market , isn't it ?there are plenty of people , they call themselves early adopters, and those folks have thousands of coins.
they bought them for cents only.

They can always drop ( sell) their coins. This would massively influence the price of bitcoins - probably going to less than USD 50 ARE YOU KIDDING????

BLOOD is in the STREETS!

BUY! BUY! BUY!I think you're making an assumption (a reasonable one to make, I suppose) that news and price are tied, primarily. 

I suspect, after watching the price for some time now, that news and price are largely unrelated. People have suggested things like ""the Chinese aren't reading Reddit"", and that makes sense. 

I for one don't really think news and price are all that closely linked. <shrug> I think that is more closely linked (although in non-linear ways, probably) would be other markets, be they currency or commodity or real estate, etc., markets. "

No more clumsy copying and pasting addresses between windows or QR code scanning.;"Why the fuck is it cheaper for the Coinbase Bitcoins over the regular ones? no transaction fee?Now gyft just needs to let one enter an exact amount for a card--like egifter.1) you can have websites and programs respond to the Bitcoin protocol so that you can just click on a QR code and it takes you to whatever wallet you want (coinbase, circle, Bitcoin core, electrum, multibit, etc) on the spend page with address and amount filled out. Super easy. On PC this works with websites and apps; on android this works with any app you have installed; on iOS it works with the last wallet app you installed (apple designed that aspect poorly, it's not the app devs' faults).

2) Why would one be called ""Bitcoin"" and the other be called ""Coinbase"" even though Coinbase lets you pay from any wallet (using the protocol stuff I mentioned above)? Twitch (the game streaming website) has the same kind of choice: If you use ""Bitcoin"" Xsolla waits for one confirmation, if you use ""Coinbase"" the 0conf transaction is accepted. IMO confusing to beginners.Not in the iOS app yet.We need a wallet aggregator app. It finds the exchange rate for you. Like Kayak for bitcoin.I prefer the clumsy copying and pasting.Whats needed is not coinbase options but standardisation in general for bitcoin payments so it can be a seamless one click option with all wallets. 

I think standards needs to also consider the future of cash like payments of bitcoin so options where you can click and pay and include a delivery address or email stored in the wallet and then just a basic option to click and pay without details.

Didnt the bitcoin foundation say they were working on standards?This is bad for bitcoin. We don't want one player to be too big and do these off-chain transactions for merchants.

Coinbase has a really good position for being a payment processor and at the same time have a wallet that can do off-chain transactions. It's really hostile for bitcoin, because they're not really promoting Bitcoin, they're promoting their own system that has hijacked bitcoin.

2015-02-03 23:40:11;Bitcoin Is Not Quantum-Safe, And How We Can Fix It When Needed;"[deleted]Throwback Tuesday?  Written  JULY 30, 2013, posted here [multiple times](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jekwz/bitcoin_is_not_quantumsafe_and_how_we_can_fix_it/).>However, the challenge is, how do you actually spend the funds? In order to release the bitcoins sent to that address, it is necessary to create a Bitcoin transaction, and that transaction must include a signature and a public key to verify that it was the owner of the private key that signed it. However, here lies the problem. By making that transaction, you have just released all of the information that anyone with a quantum computer needs to fully impersonate you, right on the spot....

>If you send a transaction spending all 100 BTC in address 13ign, with 10 BTC going to 1v1tal to pay for goods and 90 BTC change going back to your new address at 1mcqmmnx, the first node that you send the transaction to can replace the change address with whatever they want, recover the private key from your public key, and forge your signature. The only way to get around the problem is essentially to send the transaction directly to a mining pool, like BTCGuild or Slush, and hope that the mining pool will be honest and place the transaction directly into the blockchain. Even then, however, you are vulnerable to a Finney attack â a dishonest miner can forge your signature, create a valid block containing his forged transaction continuing the blockchain from one before the most recent block (the one containing your transaction), and, since the lengths of the old and new blockchains would then be equal, the attacker would have a 50% chance of his block taking precedence. Thus, safe transactions are essentially impossible.

Does that mean if I run a full node *or* 

online armory+full node *or* 

electrum server+full node, *and* 

broadcast the signed transaction myself I am completely safe ?
/u/vbuterin>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography

Wouldn't this be a huge problem for all encryption,  including banks???nice post vitalik.

the TLDR of quantum computing

(1) don't reuse addresses, ever, for any reason - using any address twice means the public is public and can be attacked, whereas a single-use address requires first determining your pubkey from the sha256 of said pubkey, a non-trivial task.

(2) spread out your utxos across many addresses - by having a single address with a large amount of btc, you reduce the cost of attacking your funds substantially. by spreading out your btc across many addresses, you linearly increase the cost of such an attack.

if quantum computers exist, e.g. USG has developed them in secret somewhere underground, they are likely expensive to maintain and run, so the advice given above will help to make your btc prohibitively expensive to attack.

shop smart, shop s-mart.Old bitcoin addresss UTXO should be able to be spent normally even if newer ones can only be Lamport.  Backwards compatibility is an absolute necessity.  All valid UTXO that are spendable today must be spendable tomorrow.  And people can choose to use or not use insecure methods.  I can send money to the output

    420 OP_EQUAL

if I want to.  It's insecure, but I'm allowed to do it.  The scripts are the scripts, and are there for scripting.  Lamport sigs should be *available* and *highly advised* and *standard*, but older address support for older UTXO must remain intact for compatibility.

Also...

NO TRUSTED NODES.  EVER.  UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

*That's the entire point of Bitcoin.*I'm more worried about fusion powered mining centralization, tachyon transporter gold thefts, and time traveling double spends.Are multi-sig addresses less vulnerable?Practical quantum computers seem to be really far off. I don't think there is any need to rush on this. Why not take these steps in advance?http://www.waters.nyc/writing/quantum-bitcoin

I tried to throw this together quickly. I remember doing some research in 2013 after reading Vitalik's piece - but I never wrote about it until now. 

His points about lamport signatures are awesome, and I hope this kind of tech makes it into Bitcoin soon. Although in the worst case, I think Bitcoin may just have to take a few hours bank holiday to hot-fix the quantum threat. ;)Well, not to be a conspiracy theorist, but has anyone made the connection of D-Wave and Tim Draper? 

DFJ has funded D-Wave to the tune of $29 million. The 'D,' being Tim Draper, who bought 30,000 bitcoins.  

This is what Steve Jurvetson said in reguards to QC: ""I did suggest that might be a lucrative QC background process a couple years ago and they looked at it, and just as this architecture is not particularly well suited for factoring integers, it's not particularly good at code cracking or bitcoin miningâ¦. butâ¦such a specialty QC could be builtâ¦Concern trolling about something that doesn't even exist yet and may never exist for all we know right now?...awesome article. /s

Next up, an article about how we can prevent aliens from abducting our bitcoins...
I recently saw a talk by [Cris Moore](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~moore/) of the [Santa Fe Institute](http://santafe.edu/) titled ""Sending Secrets: Security and Privacy in a Quantum World"". Very pertinent to this discussion.

Slides: http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~moore/sending_secrets.pdf

Video: http://vimeo.com/118261234
*whereas âunusedâ Bitcoin addresses, which may have received bitcoins but have never been spent from, do not have their public keys exposed*

Now I'm confused.

Everywhere I read that a bitcoin address is the same as the public key. E.g. on the [wiki Bitcoin Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network) it sais *...public keys (bitcoin addresses)...* 
So apparently this is NOT the case and the address is hashed from the public key. (This would imply that a LOT of videos and articles on bitcoin need an update because on most it's said that the public key IS the address.)

Or am I missing something?Judging at the history of secret technologies developed by the US government, we're fucked if they wanted to shut down Bitcoin then.

The US government has always been way ahead of commercial technologic development, we had our first computers in the 1940s to develop the necessary calculations for atomic forces when building an atomic bomb, at the time most of the world was barely using planes for commercial flight,  and didn't even have a clue what a computer was...

Those guys probably have had working active Quantum computers able to break any non quantum-safe encryption out there, it's a matter of national security and supremacy, I don't see why not with such huge budgets and so much time to develop it since the 40s.> âUnusedâ Bitcoin addresses, on the other hand, expose only the address itself, so it is the RIPEMD-160 Grover problem that poses the weakened, but still insurmountable, challenge.

To get from a public key to an address, you need to do RIPEMD(SHA256(public key))

**Question:** Am I wrong in thinking you need to find both a 256 bit origin for a 160 bit address, plus a 256 bit origin for that 'intermediate' 256 bit address to get to the public key?

Doesn't the security in an address come from *both* SHA256 and RIPEMD, rather than the weakest of those; if you break one but not the other, you still cannot derive the public key.

How does the 'RIPEMD-160 Grover problem' pose the challenge? There's still the glaring SHA256 Grover problem waiting for you when you're done with RIPEMD.Quantum computing breaking ECC would probably kick off several hundred wars before bitcoin was even considered as a target.

It would basically lay bare every secret exchanged for decades.Another solution is to lock the transactions in place before the next block so that they cannot be forged. An example of an implementation is Darkcoin's InstanTX. [deleted]This just in, bitcoin is not safe from Unicorns either.How does this apply to electrum? If I have wallets that I have spent from, are those wallets not safe to use anymore?This isn't as scary as it sounds, and we've had plans for how to safely deal with this since before the article was written nearly **2 years ago** (but Vitalik has never followed Bitcoin development closely, so he didn't know).

You're only at risk if you misuse Bitcoin (eg, receiving with the same address multiple times), or quantum computers turn up without anyone noticing (which they would pretty fast if people started losing bitcoins). Otherwise, just stop using Bitcoin immediately when/if quantum computers become reality, until the network and yourself have both upgraded to a quantum-safe hardfork.

In any case, it's still unlikely that we'll see quantum computers before quantum-safe Bitcoin comes about via a (to-be) scheduled softfork.[deleted]"

2015-02-03 23:23:25;Why Coinbase is the best..........Always Classy.;"I too am thankful for the quickness and understanding of the Coinbase Community and the Reddit community. Not only did we have some really important conversations today, we got a TON of amazing feedback. Thank you as well.This. Right. Here. I was also an idiot this morning and was fully prepared to just eat my loss as I realized what I did right away but it was to late.

I filled out a support ticket to notify them of the Phishing email going around, I never requested a refund as as far as I was concerned it was my own damn fault I lost the BTC. Definitely will be using them for the long term. CoinBase already proved they got my back.

EDIT: SpellingGreat ending to a crappy scenario.  Good show Coinbase, and good for you!Everybody should be using some sort of hardware wallet.Lose not loose. > Coinbase has a the best security on the market, and are always trying to improve it. 

I just want to add that there are others as well doing very similar and smart things. I won't take away your endorsement by advertising another (European based) exchange, just be happy its getting much better :)Good press right after lauching the exchange. How do we know if you are now coinbase themselves Do not forget they give out details about your transactions to the good old gov: http://libertycrier.com/coinbase-tracking-users-spend-bitcoins/

Stay Classy ;)This is a shill post.

Coinbase scams people by cancelling orders during periods of high volatility.

Coinbase performs surveillance of where bitcoins are going after they leave their hands.

#imaginecoinbaseAgree, I've been using Coinbase since the beginning, they just keep constantly and consistently improving in all areas, solid company. Even though it is  centralized, it is an important step for mainstream adoption, since most people are not technical and savvy enough to keep their bitcoins safe by themselves.

250 bits /u/changetipClassy = not following coins after multiple hops to mine info from users.  Coinbase is far from classy.Stay classy CB. Anyone out there in the BTC business community with a time horizon of more than 6 months, or any desire for investor capital, may want to take note of this.  The ""free market"" at work doesn't just mean ""buyer beware""...over the long term, the free market will support the businesses that look out for their customers.
How many times do I have to say this?!  IF YOU DON'T OWN THE KEYS...oh, wait.  Nevermind... :)Or you could just store your coins on a hardware wallet yourself so you don't get phished. Wouldn't this have been avoided if they just required a 2 factor code each and every time any movement of funds were made including buying and selling? If I remember correctly even campbx did that.Great story glad you learned and recovered them.  Well done on this issue Coinbase. Dont lose these 100 bits /u/changetipOr just use a mobile or hardware wallet where phishing attacks don't work. Coinbase's insurance will only cover so many losses until they realize they have to make money on all those funds they *store* for people. They will either charge for that service or have to loan out the money. Once they loan money, welcome back to fractional reserve."

2015-02-10 23:38:45;Say NO to Gavincoin!!! Why the blocksize limit keeps Bitcoin free and decentralized!!!;"I say YES to bitcoin with bigger size limit.  This is beyond dumb to the point of actually seeming quite insidious. 

 They are actually advocating that individuals be priced out of the blockchain and forced to ask permission from a cartel of large and easily regulated financial institutions (banks) to use ""their"" network.

It's an attempt to maintain the status quo. 


The block size MUST increase, as was always the intention.
I say yes for the larger block size. The logic of this video says, ""dont change bitcoin fundamentals"" then offers a solution of off-chain transactions which is an even bigger fundamental flaw. Says the guy named shortbitcoin.  Seriously?Bitcoin can't scale at 1mb... Even with off-chain transactions..... I say absolutely YES to bigger blocksize!

Bandwidth grows by 50% per year (10% less than Moore's Law for computer speed) 

From the video:

> Easy thing to do is just have everyone change their software to accept bigger blocks all at once.  Fees would go down,

So far so good, but then these next conclusions without citing why they would be the case:

> but you will need an expensive data center to run a node.

Why?

> and you won't be able to do it anonymously.

Why not?

> Mining pools will be forced to close due to rising costs

Following from the first one, supposedly, but that's still unanswered at this point.

> and regulations.

I guess that's supposed to follow from the second point?  Because regulations don't mean anything if you can be anonymous or...whatever logic they're using?

Of course they then propose to effectively introduce more MtGox's.  Or, well, payment processors that internally, and perhaps with each other, make agreements on which account has what funds, making transfers instant - but completely publicly untransparent; you have to trust the off-chain ledgers, and thus trust them not to game those ledgers.

Additionally, what makes 1MB ideal?  Maybe, for their arguments' sake, 256kB would be even better, and they should aim to have the block size reduced?

Edit: I just realized the best part - that video is from *2013*.  Yikes."

Obviously shutting down like this is not in their best interest. There have already been offers to purchase the company.

Since CAVIRTEX was not 100% privately held, don't the officers of the corporation have a legal responsibility to act in the best interest of the shareholders?Could be anything.  

I suspect however that the reward was not looking substantial enough in proportion to the risk. That seems to be the gist of their message.  Looking at some of their trade history you can see how low trade volume could easily play a part. Limited trading means limited profit which leads to fewer employees able to be staffed. They could have been understaffed, running at a loss, or barely keeping their head above water. Add in a database compromise and not enough man power to resolve the issue/reputation damage and you're looking at a business which doesn't have a bright future or long term viability.

Perhaps they will relaunch under a new name and new infrastructure starting fresh with better policies and security.
These are dark days for bitcoin in Canada. The new year is supposed to bring in good things - within the first two months two of the largest (out of three) bitcoin exchanges shut down. Vault of Satoshi because they weren't as profitable, and Cavirtex because of a compromised security system.

Nothing is beginning that will affect you, unless you happen to be a large institutional investor trying to temporarily park your $5 billion in a bank account.

The WSJ has more on this story (behind a paywall).  From the WSJ story:

""Since the financial crisis, new rules have been put into place that require banks to maintain enough high-quality assets that could be converted into cash during a crisis to cover a projected flight of deposits over 30 days. Because large, uninsured deposits would be expected to leave most quickly, the rules will now require that banks maintain reserves for those deposits that they cannot use for profitable activities like making loans. That makes it much less efficient or profitable for banks to hold these deposits"".

What this means is that if some group has a short term billion dollar deposit which appears likely to be taken back out soon, the big banks such as JP Morgan will have to keep most or all of it in reserves, and won't be able to loan it out or do anything with it.

Since they can't do anything with it, they can't make any money from it, so they'll have to start charging fees to hold it.

None of this has anything to do with bitcoin.""The plan wonât affect the bankâs retail customers...""

...yet.FTA: ""New federal rules essentially penalize banks for holding deposits viewed as prone to fleeing during a crisis or a stressed environment. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com [behind paywall].""

Not everything is a secret reason to use Bitcoin. That's one thing I hated about these banks during the recession years.  I had a 25k credit balance with Citi at 6.99%...then they tried to increase it to 14% at which I bitched and argued and they settled for 9.99%.  Then a few months later they said either I take the 14% or the account gets closed.  I told the CS agent that they were borrowing money at the lowest rate possible and they were extorting me for 13.75% on top of that?!  

Fuck them.Says the bank that earned how much profit last year?> The plan wonât affect the bankâs retail customers

Reading comprehension isn't good for Bitcoin.Wait, people deposit funds with ""J.P.Morgan""??   Bwahahhahahaa..  The article seems to make it sound like it's the government's fault.Matt Drudge has same title... This is driven somewhat by regulation. Banks used to be able to take risk with client money. It provided enough returns in the long run to offer interest on deposits, but with the new regs that protect against huge systematic events, banks can only use deposits for a very limited scope of investments, all of which have low returns due to QE. This has literally nothing to do with Bitcoin

And Wtf ar  you implying with ""it begins"" ... Hopefully you don't mean this is the start of an abundance of unrelated posts. What begins?>News articles that do not contain the word ""Bitcoin"" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.Where the hell are the mods? This has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Mods once again are asleep.> New federal rules essentially penalize banks for holding deposits viewed as **prone to fleeing during a crisis or a stressed environment**. [emphasis mine]

Fleeing to where - and this is bad.Better thank the fed for the 0% interest rates and all this easy money crap. "

You can import the keys into as many wallets as you want and the balances will show up in all the wallets.  You can also just connect via wireless and do stuff.I would go to iFixit or wherever and buy a new screen.

I'm certainly no insider in the financial world, but I can imagine someone or her standing making the leap to cryptocurrencies will have a tremendous effect on others in the same business.That woman disgusts me to no end.I find it sad and concerning that the financial gangsters seem to right now adopt Bitcoin quicker than the masses do. They have the advantage of funding too.  
If they manage to get their foot in the door, the infrastructure will be held by select private corporations, and they will set the rules.

2015-03-10 23:38:34;Blythe Masters joins Bitcoin start-up 'Digital Asset Holdings';"Blythe Masters, the former head of the JPMorgan Chase commodities trading operation? ho-lee-sh*t.

In the mid-1990s she developed and marketed credit derivatives (remember the sub-prime crisis in 2008 and all the CDS/CDO magic that caused it?) and she was also suspected of massively shorting the silver commodity market in recent years.

Not sure if I should be elated or terrified of her moving into Bitcoin. 

This is like Darth Vader joining the light side... what could possibly go wrong?I believe this is serius...   Either big banks are jumping onboard to not become irrelevant or she can derivatize bitcoin to try to marginalize it and make it irrelevant.  It has been claimed that she was responsible for seting up manipulation schemes in precious metals to suppress their price this hiding a sure measure of inflation.**More analysis:**

>A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (the creditor of the reference loan) in the event of a loan default (by the debtor) or other credit event. This is to say that the seller of the CDS insures the buyer against some reference loan defaulting. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS ""fee"" or ""spread"") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. **It was invented by Blythe Masters from JP Morgan in 1994.**

>By the end of 2007, the outstanding CDS amount was **$62.2 trillion**,^[3] falling to $26.3 trillion by mid-year 2010 ^[4] but reportedly $25.5 ^[5] trillion in early 2012. CDSs are not traded on an exchange and there is no required reporting of transactions to a government agency.^[6] During the 2007-2010 financial crisis the lack of transparency in this large market became a concern to regulators as it could pose a systemic risk.^[7][8][9][10]

To put this in perspective the Hoover Dam generates  2,074 MW, so bitcoin draws about 10% of what the Hoover Dam is spec'ed to generate.

The Sanxia Dam in China generates ~22,000 MW, so Bitcoin draws only 1% of that single dam.

Kinda puts into perspective just how much power humanity consumes today.300 MH/s GPU mining per day gets 0.00000323 BTC today.
That number is effected by short term variance.  A better estimate is about 370 petahashes.

https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficultyNot true, you can't use blockchain.info as a measure. If luck is up for a short period and the time it takes to solve a block goes under ten minutes then the blockchain will give you a false reading.

2015-04-07 23:09:46;Banks Can Cherry-Pick the Best Bits from Bitcoin: Report;"I used to be open to Tim Swannson's opinions, but he is now on my ignore list. He understands Bitcoin enough, but he's not on board to the paradigm shift that is coming.

As far as ""problem""anonymity of miners and transaction censorship - that's complete BS.

The banks can choose who they broadcast to, also the banks can run their own miners and nodes so they never have to worry about that. 

I dont agree with the Value asymmetry argument - it misses the point that the more money pours into bitcoin the stronger the security gets.I don't know about this Tim Swanson character... Tim Swanson has been heckling the bitcoin community for years.  When his complaint of the week runs out he picks up another.  It almost seems to be his way of getting attention--or it's his assignment.Ha ha ha ha ha, good luck banks!I'd like to see them cherry-pick the hash power of the miners, which dwarfs anything any single organisation has access to simply by virtue of being decentralised.

So ""banks""... go to it.  Let's see your cherry-picked altcoin, and we'll laugh ourselves stupid as it goes under the steamroller that is Bitcoin's network effect, just like every other altcoin has.Cherry-pick the best for banks or the best for customers and society? :D [deleted]i have an app and am using a permisioned ledger in it, its great.

2015-04-07 23:05:04;"Can I donate to ""the first American presidential candidate to accept bitcoin"" from Portugal, Europe?";"[deleted]In order for the FEC to require that the donor information be reported AT ALL, the donation must exceed $200.

The FEC and all the politicians, they ALL KNOW that illegal campaign contributions come in to candidates in small amounts, from all over the world, and THEY DON'T CARE, because the only contributions that matter are the PAC monies as they are literally hundreds, HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of dollars that are spent ""on behalf"" of a candidate or to support a candidate.

All of the contributions from all of the individuals contributing monies below the $200 threshold are not a concern to the FEC or any regulatory body, they just don't matter, at all to them. They don't care.

If, by some incredible long shot Rand Paul gets the nomination, and then stands to win the presidency, there are a LOT more damaging things that will be done to him than the accusation that he accepted a little illegal bitcoin.

And yes, it is potentially easier to make small, illegal bitcoin donations, but THEY DON'T MATTER and nobody gives a fuck about them.

The campaign finance criminals in Washington, for them, this is like a joke to tell at lunch, and they laugh, they laugh LOUD ... because they know the real truth about campaign finance, and they want YOU ... not to know. And they laugh.If you want to support him, please undo this transaction.If you truly support him, then don't do this. Only US citizens are allowed to directly donate. It will come back and harm future politicians accepting bitcoin and the politicians themselves. 

Of course you could create a decentralized bitcoin PAC or crowdfund and give the bitcoin via a legit american citizen perhaps?

P.S. I am not endorsing anyone for president. 1) Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late

2) fcuk it - US politics is as skewed and messed up by special interests as it possibly can be and it's not gonna change, I say welcome, jump in, make your BTC contribution.  I look forward to the 1st Portuguese politico candidate that *I* can contribute to - I'd do it just to F with the system (OK, I suppose I'd check they weren't rampantly pro-life or something but ...)

So, let's get real and to the bottom line here:  soon enough it's gonna matter a whole lot more what planet we come from not what tiny piece of one.  Or whether we're meat-based or A.G.I.  Or both.

Anyways, props out bro roll /u/changetip verifyJa fizeste merda.....Am I reading this correct? He has gotten 650 btc so far ?1) I appreciate that you're smart enough to know that most Americans need help to know that Portugal is in Europe.
2) This is America, where corporations are people and money=speech. Donate as much as you like, rules and reality don't apply.You can can send it to anyone from space if you can get a signal.You could, but it's hella illegal and once it comes out it's gonna be a massive shitstorm. 

TL;DR: You could, but you shouldn't.I am sure you can donate to PACs that support such a candidate though.This is amazing. Imagine if everyone else in the world could anonymously donate to US political candidates! China would be all over that shit...Obama got plenty of money from overseas ...but he is black so the media looked the other way Thanks for all the answers...

No one answered to this question though...

Leslie Lamport: distributed systems pioneer, you may know him from Lamport timestamps (""Time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system""), or his 1982 paper ""The Byzantine Generals' Problem"". Also invented Lamport signatures (hash-based post-quantum awesomeness *in 1979*; see http://sphincs.cr.yp.to/ for today's state-of-the-art in this area).

2015-04-21 23:23:14;Perm BTC Wallet Reuse for Merchants;"I may be wrong: When you receive bitcoin, funds do not go to your public key, but the hash of the public key. 

When you send bitcoin, you expose your real public key (private key is still hidden) during the signature process. This is the part that has a potential to be harmful if the attacker has the right tools.Everytime you sign a transaction and redeem an output, there are actually two keypairs involved: your public and private key(P, p) that you already know and also a session keypair or sometimes called ephemeral keypair(let's call it (R, r) ).

The ephemeral keys are chosen randomly and it's used only for the current transaction you're signing. Everytime you sign a transaction a new ephemeral private key is generated.

Reusing your exist public private key normally isn't an issue if you're not concerned about privacy. The security risk comes from either reusing a a session keypair (R, r) with another transaction or the wallet software you're using has a compromised or weak PRNG that generates predictable (R, r). If that happens then you've effectively leaked your private key and a malicious actor can steal the funds from that bitcoin address."

If people don't want to learn through reason and evidence, they will learn through bitter experience.Those pesky hoarders lol. Well some day they will probably get some inflation.*savingA lot of this money will also be hidden from the spouse. There's a potential role for Bitcoin here, if anybody can crack the logistics of non-technical users secretly buying a little bit bitcoin every month and storing it in a brainwallet.Hat Tip to Rawdog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4pDgtNcEYs And I though my mattress was lumpy.........Not surprising, actually; I think Japan held the title for the nation with the highest savings per capita of all developed nation/economies for decades. House-wifes routinely stash money away, as they are the one's who manage finances in Japanese culture. 

There was a series of articles noting Japan's low savings saving rates in the past 5-8 years, but I always thought that was just what was held at the banks/investment firms. Good to know I wasn't that far off, I thought it was closer to half a trillion--then again this was during a strong yen so perhaps was correct at the time. Inflation creeps in regardless, which is rather sad as much of this is likely life savings, rainy day money or inheritances... and Abenomics shows no sign of slowing down. Why would anyone hold their money in the bank? Deposit rate 0.22% for 3 year. 0.03% for 2 year. The risk is far greater than that. They will even eat the 2.2% inflation AND the security risk to have instant access to their savings.

The author seemed to focus on the ""kiteboarding"" aspect of the MaiTai description and not so much the ""entrepreneurs and venture capitalists"" part.

She also did not post a link, or call it by it's full name, ""MaiTai Global"". She also failed to mention another attendee, Bill Tai, is also a co-founder of this MaiTai Global. And [the website](http://www.maitaiglobal.org/) says prominently that ""MaiTai Global is a group of extraordinary entrepreneurs, innovators and athletes"".

She also failed to mention (or notice) that the logo for MaiTai Global is the logo at the top of the Blockchain Summit site, and the site layout is essentially the same. Hmm... could, I dunno, MaiTai Global be the ones running the event? Gee, perhaps having two of their founders present doesn't seem so odd now, does it?

Answer: When we talk to banks, when we talk about bitcoin, they want to stay away from it. We donât use bitcoin, we use the blockchain. And we donât use it just to say that we use the blockchain. It allows us to avoid being a trusted third-party.

Swap 'bitcoin' with 'email', and 'blockchain' with 'internet' and you get an idea of how short sighted the banks are being by automatically discounting anything related to bitcoin. ""We couldn't possibly do anything over the internet"" is basically their response and in that light you can immediately see why they are being so stupid by automatically dismissing away bitcoin related technology. 

The blockchain is not just about bitcoin. More properly it should be seen as really no different to a 'second layer' of the internet that runs on it's own separate servers. Just like internet was back in the mid 90's, before it really took off with business and the general public - it may not have widespread public use just yet, but the base infrastructure is in place and the potential of its power is just waiting to be exploited.  You can do this yourself: http://jrruethe.github.io/blog/2015/02/28/blockchain-identity/In their video, they represent the blockchain by the Blockchain Info company logo. Looks legit.

When a new wallet is created there is a PGP/AES encrypted exchange with the multibit.org server. A (random) selection of addresses is chosen from a large set of addresses for future BRIT payments. These are stored in the wallet so the exchange only happens once.

There is a list of fallback addresses in case the server is down.

I have noticed they deleted my contracts and my orders. My last order status is:

**Order BTC-xxxx was placed on June 9, 2015 and is currently trash**

This means they're still managing the website.There is a new phone number on the website (in the account webpage):

I'll fill out the report, just curious as to what usually happens..I just checked the Bitcoin receiving address they gave me on the 9th to pay for the order on https://blockchain.info and I can confirm they've never stopped receiving Bitcoins on this address. This must one of many addresses they use so I can imagine there are still many orders being processed!

2015-06-09 23:25:30;What is the future of bitcoin?;"To add a little more context. Having an unlimited block size would allow people to spam the nework and make storing the block chain on personal computers impractical. Having a 1mb, as it is now, does not allow bitcoin to scale to a global level, it would only allow people willing to spend very high transaction fees to transact. 20mb block size is a happy medium of the two, however it hard forks bitcoin and is a unknown that people are afraid of. Their are many other solutions such as a dynamic blocks zero that would change depending on how full the last x amount of blocks were, similar to how the difficulty is set. Hope that answers your question, a better answer will require someone who understands the code better than I do.

You can also have private internets, private facebooks, etc. Like for example, North Korea has their own private internet, and their population is blocked from the Internet. That is why there will also co-exist many private blockchains. In time, this will be the norm and ordinary people will be oblivious to the workings.

When I first saw it I believed it was true, went into a depression, and stopped using the internet for several months.>that all emails must purchase a postage stamp before being sent

That's not what the BL is. A more fair comparison would be that you would need a license for running an SMTP server that **hosts mailboxes of users** that are not you or your family. And you did - in a way - if you are an ISP you fall under telco. and privacy regulation.You're preaching to the choir, but amen to that. There would be so much less spam though.
And we would know who's spamming us!I don't think that is a good comparison because email is not a financial instrument. A more apt comparison is MIIT in China.This claim is hilarious because the cryptography underlying bitcoin,  hashcash, was invented for literally this exact purpose. (Payment and verification of email.)The government never did that to email because it's never seen much crime happening over mail anonymously.

It sees lots of crime happening with money anonymously.Except that that would be stupid. The BitLicense is not stupid. How many times do you need this explained to you, Erik?"
2015-06-16 23:55:53;Why are most Bitcoin miners in China when Bitcoin itself is illegal to spend there and why are we considering them so heavily in the block size debate?;"I don't think it's illegal for the individual user to use, just banks. They have a large percentage of total mining. People mine there because electricty is much cheaper, labor is much cheaper, and there are less regulations to worry about.Because the Chinese know how to fucking hustle.  Right now the hustle is in Bitcoin, the rest of the world just doesn't know it yet.  60% of the hashrate could choose to drop out or attack.  We should at least take some time to consider their views no matter if that hashrate is located in Madagascar, the Faroe Islands, or China.

Many miners are located in China because electricity is cheap there.  It also fits in with being an export economy in general: produce bitcoins and export them to the west, if profitable, like so many other products.They must be considered because they have >60% of the hashpower, so if they agree on doing something they will make it happen.  Even if some hard-headed minority decided to split the coin, the Chinese could jam it while they mine their own version.

In China, bitcoin cannot be used for e-commerce, and banks are forbidden to touch it.  But it can be owned and traded (""like postage stamps"", said a Central Bank official) and can be mined.  Using it for e-commerce would weaken the yuan and possibly let foreign bitcoin owners buy things in China with it, which the government does not like.  Letting banks to trade it would put the bank's financial security at risk, which the government does not like either.  But mining (and the manufacture of mining equipment) gets more dollars and euros into the pockets of Chinese citizens, which the the government likes very much.I believe they see the future of hope and change and hold until it does or invest what they can in their own way. Changing the world one new wallet at a time.Manufacturing is cheaper and has a comparative advantage in computer hardware. Capital outflow is controlled and bitcoin is a means of sidestepping these controls. These capital restrictions also mean bitcoin holds a higher value than elsewhere and trades at a premium. These factors make mining more profitable than other countries. "
2015-06-16 23:28:28;Mad Bitcoins Validates Website That Should Be Shunned;
2015-06-16 23:24:41;So we decided to build a peer to peer bitcoin marketplace. Six months later... our developers haven't committed suicide! Everything we learned.;"> our developers haven't committed suicide! 

...well there's a metric I can get behind! And it's a great attention-getting headline. Got me to actually read the article, and I'm glad I did. Just a short ways in, I'm already nodding at the decision to write an api to separate hosting your own node from your core service. It's a nice move to make it flexible for scalability and resilience, although, of course, one could certainly hope that the underlying bitcoin core node would never have a hiccup (I've had good luck on a small scale running a tipbot with the underlying daemon not having issues, but I can certainly see wanting flexibility there).

One spelling mistake:

> ACID complaint

*compliant

One comment here:

> In case of a 3rd party API they can generate private key and bitcoin address for you so you would need to store them securely or at least encrypt them in the database.

It seems to me like it's worth mentioning the inherent security risk in this, in that the 3rd party obviously could choose to store that private key themselves...

> IMPORTANT! Here is a risk for a race condition. In the bitcoin network 2 blocks can be found literally at the same time which means you will receive blocknotify twice right away and during your business logic operations some unknown consequences may happen. To avoid it your callback URL defined method should be executed synchronously, for example in a queue.

Interesting consideration. Are you talking about two blocks with the same block number, rather than two consecutive blocks? I would think you mean the former, since the latter would be relatively easy to address with a little bit of logic (for instance, only move the transaction to confirmed when processing exactly the third block confirming it; of course, this requires that you are 100% sure you will process each and every block, but that should be reasonable). For the former case then, it seems to me like it would be possible to have some type of staging step which ensured unique blocks, although once I start to think about that, I start to see some unfortunate possibilities (my naive solution was to say each block number can only be processed once, but what if the first version of that block number which you receive becomes orphaned, so then you're locked into processing the wrong block? And it would be possible for the third confirmation thus to come in two different blocks. However, possibly this wouldn't matter, as in the case I'm imagining it's not a block reorganization, so either one would be fine from the perspective of confirming those transactions from two blocks prior; definitely food for thought for me).

> Which database is best is a spicy topic and worth of itâs work paper or book.

*worthy of *its [own] work paper or book

(I might also suggest 'whitepaper' rather than 'work paper', but it's certainly possible I'm just not personally familiar with the latter phrase and that it's reasonable here)

> Otherwise you can end up with adding balance twice, deleting accidentally records or simply break database schema. 

Just a quibble basically about parallel structure, merely a matter of taste: ""adding a balance twice, accidentally deleting records, or simply breaking the database schema.""

Excellent post; thank you! I would also be very interested in a discussion of the legal considerations you've faced. And looking into using your marketplace itself is certainly added to my long crypto to-do list now!good technical outline. pretty intense yet it looks just 3 or 4 pages. the good thing is that a dude in his dorm can still do a bitcoin startup so that gives me alot of hope that bitcoin won't ever go to the darkside.Great read, and nice open source libAwesome post!!!

As Executive Director I want to work with all board members -- I think Olivier could have done things in a more tactful way but I did not feel it was appropriate to have the Bitcoin Foundation blog argue with an elected board member.

>""In 2007, Columbia Business School Professor Michael Mauboussin asked his 73 students to estimate the number of jelly beans in a jar. Their estimates ranged from 250 to 4,100. There were 1,116 candies. The average error, which only two students beat, was 700. That is a 62% rate of error. However, despite the b-school students' poor judgment, the average of their guesses was 1,151â only 3% away from the actual number of jelly beans. This study has been repeated in many forms, and the results remain the same. We are bringing this convergence of beliefs to every subject from politics to climatology, harnessing the wisdom of the crowd; and forcing the crowd to put their money where their mouth is.""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market

2015-06-30 23:46:11;Is anyone else worried about more retailers not accepting Bitcoin?;"Humble Bundle not acepting BTC is only for the Borderlands bundle. You can still use BTC in the store/ on the other bundles. It was 2k's decision if reddit is correct.Wait a minute, the Humble Bundle store is *NOT* accepting Bitcoin?!I don't know that the total number is really shrinking, but there certainly is a relatively high level of attrition.

It does appear that some merchants simply wanted the ""free press"" that comes with being ""the first local [your business here] to accept Bitcoin"" -- and Bitcoin certainly delivered on the branding for some!     For instance, Cups & Cakes in San Francisco.  Certainly she was talented and probably could have made it without Bitcoin but they'ld never have gotten the dozen journalists, reporters, local and national media, etc. that they did without accepting Bitcoin.   But for every Cups & Cakes there are a couple dozen others that didn't really notice any new business as a result.   And they are the ones that mostly stop taking it after an initial trial.

But I think businesses aren't considering the cost of customer acquisition.   Essentially nearly all bitcoin-paying customers might never have stepped inside if it weren't for that business accepting Bitcoin.  There's so little downsize, certainly even a tiny bit of Bitcoin business is enough to justify keeping Bitcoin as a payment method.don't several retailers complain that almost no purchases are made when they accept bitcoin?Adoption by merchants v/s consumers is a Chicken v/s egg problem.

You don't solve chicken v/s egg problems by simply pumping the same side over and over... Our Merchants are already far ahead of consumers adoptionwise, so we have to focus everything on consumers now.Nope.  I'm worried about people not being paid in Bitcoin.  If they don't have it to spend then there's no reason for a merchant to accept it because not many people have it burning a hole in their pocket.

The problem is people don't want to be paid in Bitcoin because they can't use it to pay for everything the way you can with cash our credit card.  I think the solution is we need more services that pay people for their hobbies or alternative revenue streams in Bitcoin.

For example I can't be paid only in Bitcoin because I can't pay my mortgage with it.  I write children's books on the side.  I make a little each month from it.  I can get paid for that in Bitcoin and if that revenue comes in I'm looking to spend those Bitcoin.  Note there's more demand to use Bitcoin and merchants we'll see the benefit of accepting it.Yeah, they did this during the summer sale and haven't reconsidered.  I have purchased many games from them using bitcoin, and it bothers me that they cite fraud as an excuse.  

Bitcoin is one of the only payments that humble accepts that 1. can't be refunded, and 2. can't be charged back.  So, I dunno what the deal is here.  I'm not going to use their key service anymore until they fix it.  Which, it's too bad because they are currently having a DRM-free sale, and I try to support those titles first.Yes, it should be worrying. In order for Bitcoin to gain mass adoption, merchants needs to accept Bitcoin as currency and people need to spend bitcoins like currency. It's really that simple.

As for using bitcoins as a store of value, well that will only last so long. Unless Bitcoin has practical value, it will slowly and fitfully die. Either that, or a new digital currency will appear seemingly from out of nowhere and supersede Bitcoin. 

I don't think Bitcoin has forever to get its act together. It needs to gain traction in a serious way, and SOON.As Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell have said, merchants accepting bitcoin payments is a joke.  Only 5/1000th of 1% of humanity could possibly make a purchase using the blockchain on any given day.  Why bother?  

Similarly only 5/1000th of 1% of humanity could collect their paycheck over the blockchain on any given day.  Whatever Bitcoin's purpose is, facilitating trade doesn't appear to be it.Bitcoin got out of the currency business, now it's just some plan where you buy it then somehow failing economies make you rich then you sell them.

Most think bitcoin will exist alongside the traditional systems for the foreseeable future rather than replacing them. TV didn't kill the radio or the cinema, ebooks didn't kill paper books, etc. Like many of those previous new technologies, it appears that bitcoin is adding to an increasingly complex set of choices rather than replacing them.""

Maybe it will exists along the traditional system, but it's going to hurt it hard, taking a large part of its market. Like mp3/streaming did to the CD. Eating it progressively as technology progress.

2015-07-14 22:54:39;Stock-to-Flow Ratio of Bitcoin surpasses that of Gold in less than 10 years...;"Gold Stock-To-Flow Ratio

The greatest misunderstanding in the gold sector

There is a clear difference between commodities, which can be explained by a consumption model (e.g. crude oil, copper, agricultural commodities) and goods that are bought in order to be held (gold, diamonds, works of art). While the economic utility of a consumable good is created when it is destroyed or used up, the utility of investment assets lies in their possession and later resale. Industrial commodities therefore have low stock-to-flow ratios, this is to say, inventories usually only cover consumption demand for a few months. If there were no inventories at all, supply would have to correspond exactly to production and demand exactly to consumption. However, if there are inventories, consumption can temporarily exceed production. Since inventories of consumable commodities are as a rule very low, prices will rise quickly in anticipation of a future supply shortage and bring consumption into balance with production.

Unlike consumable commodities, gold and silver exhibit a large discrepancy between annual production and the total available supply which is a high stock-to-flow ratio. It is our premise that the high stock-to-flow ratio represents the most important characteristic of gold (and silver). The entire amount of gold ever mined totals approximately 172,000 tons. That is the stock. Annual production was about 2,700 tons as of 2012. That is the flow. If one divides the two amounts, one arrives at the stock-to-flow ratio of currently 64 years.

Gold isnât as valuable because it is so rare, but quite the opposite: Gold is valued so highly because annual production relative to the existing stock is so small. Putting it differently: not only scarcity, but primarily the relative constancy of the available stock is what makes gold unique. The annual production of 2,700 tons is therefore not relevant to price determination. This characteristic was attained over centuries and can no longer be altered. This stability and security is a crucial precondition for creating confidence.

source: http://www.incrementum.li/en/research-analysis/gold-stock-to-flow-ratio/
-------

Gold has a StFR of about 80 and that will slowly increase with time/stock. Bitcoin's flow is reducing fast (the coinbase 'mining reward' is halved each 4 years), making the StFR of Bitcoin increasing fast, will overtake that of gold in less than 10 years from now.Note: stock-to-flow ratio is just the inverse of the rate of inflation, i.e. Bitcoin's rate of inflation is currently around 10% or 1/10 per year, which means its stock-to-flow ratio is 10 years. At the halvening next year it will increase to over 20 years.So, after 2025 there's going to be essentially zero discernible supply inflation as a percentage of existing bitcoin. And in 2035, bitcoin is going to make silver look like Zimbabwean dollars. [deleted]"

deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7086  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/37335)I know we keep hearing about how ""this is bitcoin's killer app"".... but I really think this could be it. Or at least one of them.sharing bandwidth is cool but how do i control what they are doing on my network? After all, the ISP would hold you accountable.In a mesh network, each node relays and routes packets for other nodes. One must deal with broken routes, flapping, routing table discovery and updates, etc. 

From their description, it sounds like they've got just a simple captive portal with pay-as-you-go bandwidth micro-payments. 

I know, ""mesh network"" sounds cool. But implementing one in an adversarial environment, coupled with some proposed game theoretic system for bandwidth allocation marketplace is non-trivial. Think it would have been better if specifically said micropayment channels and on-demand, pay-as-you-go, anonymous(no sign ups) WiFi, since these are things that differentiate from subscription, credit card, etc.I assume this is how whatever devices eventually have 21inc's chips in them will connect & communicate with each other?  At least in terms of the payment channel aspectJust be sure to route client connections through either VPN or Tor so you are not liable for other peoples actions on your network.Moon da bitmeshIt think mesh networks need to provide something extra to really take off.  Something that the Internet can or doesn't provide well. Geographical relevance and less censorship could be enough to get it off the ground Wasn't Ryan X. Charles working on something along these lines?I don't think our 1mb blocks can support very many micro paymentsI wonder if they have considered using some cryptocurrency with faster confirmations.Any update ?I don't doubt that data usage settlement via micropayment channels will be one massive use-case of bitcoin.  Maps way too well to the problems surrounding Net Neutrality and is a more elegant solution than laws can make for us.  But I can't help but think layer 3 in a bitcoin mesh needs rethought; especially when we start thinking about a scaled bitcoin with Lightning Network payment channels.  The lines between transaction and data routing will be blurry.  Imagine data that never leaves the mesh.  ELI5?How about security concerns?  Whenever I connect to my email or bank account, it's mostly over a trusted wifi network at minimum, but I usually log into email/bank using a wired connection.

If I am using someone elses wireless connection, would it be wise to log into your bank account/email etc?I hope 21 is working on something similar.

They must be close to shipping something by now.Any investors?  At this point, I see a website. I'm not convinced that humans are organised enough to make this successful. In my apartment building, everyone has their own wifi which they pay for and use infrequently and spottily. If they were organised enough they could map out which wifi is wasted and share wifi connections to reduce their bills.

The problem here isn't payments- it's organisation and planning.

But suppose this problem is not a problem and we somehow organise ourselves optimally such that the total bandwidth of the building is used perfectly, so the total external data rate is always the same (unlikely I know but let's be fanciful). Since the wifi providers no longer are seeing typical low and spotty usage, they will rate limit or increase their prices to compensate them since, on average, each customer now will use more bandwidth.

Am I missing something magic about this? I know plenty about internetworking and that stuff and just don't see it when people are saying ""this is the coolest thing ever"". How does this save bandwidth?

Also, see my other post about multi-homing not being practical at the moment. The internet wants you to connect with one connection only right now.

I love Bitcoin and I love networks which means I should think this is a great idea, but I don't. Help!this is cool, but someone is going to invent a version of this that doesn't involve them taking a cutwell... until fees increase anyway"

2015-07-28 23:58:07;Bitcoin newbie: some questions;"It's anonymous unless you get your exchange subpoenaedIt somewhat depends.

The iDeal system itself is token-based, so the merchant should not be getting your bank account number.  However, this token or some identifier is undoubtedly stored, and the banks would know all the details, so it's pseudonymous at best.

However, if you trade more than â¬50 worth of Bitcoin, you're required to verify your bank account.  In that case, there's a more direct association with your real life persona via e-mail and (mobile) phone number.  See:  https://bitonic.nl/faq#verificatie

I'm not too sure about the Dutch market - I think Bitonic is the #1 solution there.  I have traded via localbitcoins while in Amsterdam a few times, but rarely do so now.  In theory, that can be practically anonymous (tinfoil hat about security cameras and such aside).

Note that you can always send your purchased Bitcoin to a new address and nobody would really know if you just happened to make a purchase, or whether you control that address.  You can further obfuscate things by partnering with somebody else to make a transaction, but I'm sure all that is explained in any anonymity guides :)Since you're using an iPhone you can use ATOMBIT Wallet to buy bitcoins with your PayPal account. You can create an unverified PayPal account, which will increase your anonymity. "

2015-08-04 23:59:42;T0.com | The Trade is the Settlement;"At the end of the t0 release event, Patrick Byrne said **they *have* selected a blockchain to use, but they aren't announcing which one yet**. He also said t0 is ""blockchain agnostic"" which he explained means that it can use ANY blockchain, be it Bitcoin or Counterparty or Ripple or ~~Coinbase~~ Circle (I think that last one was a slip of the tongue. And I really hope Ripple was a joke.)

Note: I did notice earlier in the event Patrick said they did a practice settlement with their first company, and they did it on the **Bitcoin** blockchain. He specifically said the word ""Bitcoin"" there.I still don't understand what this is. In his presentation, Byrne said it was ""ledger agnostic."" He also methioned the goal of making the trade be the settlement.

All well and good, but what does t0 actually *do*? Bitcoin has been doing trade as settlement for six years now. Open Assets protocol allows the same thing to happen with arbitrary assets. So what is the critical missing part that t0 makes available?
Poking around the t0 website it looks like they have a 'blockchain explorer'. Can verify that it accepts bitcoin addresses as a valid input, not sure what other blockchain it is set up for as well

Edit: [Link](http://t0.com/explorer) is http://t0.com/explorerIs this running on bitcoin's blockchain?
It seems like their explorer only takes Bitcoin addresses and something called asset address. It looks like an asset address points to a Bitcoin address, but my guess is they plan to add other ""blockchains"" in the future and the asset address is meant to be generalized across blockchains. I tried ethereum, doge, and litecoin addresses to no avail.Is the writing not on the wall? How could it be any other blockchain when the security of Bitcoin dwarfs the rest. The Trade is the Settlement ... and Bitcoin network is the settlement layer.Do we know what blockchain this is being built on yet?
 Counterparty and (soon) Ethereum.'Ledger agnostic' is Byrne's way of saying 'We're using blockchain technology, but not the PoW public blockchain'. The financial sector has already decided it's going to use Proof of Trust private blockchains for settlement. Going to the Courts for restitution if the goods aren't delivered is a model they are comfortable with and the chances of non-delivery are small. The Web site does refer to 'the blockchain' but I think that's because it reads better than 'a (random) blockchain'. Also it says 'affecting nearly instantaneous settlement' which is poor.

We all know that PB is on a crusade to overturn the tables of the financial establishment and good luck to him, but we may have to accept that the public blockchain will be most useful to people who have little or no recourse to the Courts as the value is inherent in the transfer. Selling businesses a trendy database and calling it a blockchain might be a stepping stone, or it might not.Bitcoin's chain won't be able to handle even moderate trading activity currently. Either settlements are bundled (e.g. 1 settlement every second/minute/hour...) or they are going to use something with fewer/no limitations on transaction amount.

Edit: Amount meaning volume, not content.you guys broke the site...No registrations, premature hype.

Also, how does this use the bitcoin blockchain?the short token concept is very interesting!  Bringing more honesty and transparency to shorting could revolutionize trading for the better

2015-08-04 23:58:35;How long until someone buries child pornography in the blockchain?;"u must be new, and not smart enough to use googleHashes of copyrighted material?There are three things that need to be distinguished:

1. **The file.** This is the actual data. Putting this in the blockchain could be expensive depending on how big the file is.

2. **The hash.** This is the fingerprint of the file. It just says ""This file existed."" It is impossible to recover the file from the hash alone.

3. **A link.** This is a pointer to somewhere else where you may be able to get the file. ""The file is over there."" A link can be broken if the file it points to is removed. A hash can be used as a link if the file is in a filesystem that is aware of the hash. There have already been links to CP put in the blockchain. I highly doubt those links still work.

Most methods of ""storing files in the blockchain"" don't put the actual files in the blockchain. They put a hash and possibly a link in the blockchain. The actual files are delivered to interested parties through some other channels. You can run a full node without participating in those external channels or downloading those extra files.There have been links in there a couple of years already. Heuristics could be used to ensure any address stored permanently in the blockchain is a hash of preimage data:

http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bitcoin.devel/1996The blockchain has no way to store data; it isn't a storage system. When people talk about this kind of stuff, what they really mean is encoding their garbage to look like financial transfers, and then decoding it later. That misinterpretation of the blockchain's data-set is what would be the child porn, not the blockchain itself.

In reality, it was a BTC -> paypal exchange with a friend, but they say I'm lying. I have transaction details if they want it, but haven't heard back. I don't like the idea that they track transactions - regular banks (usually) don't care, yet Coinbase cares that I'm an ""accomplice"" with someone I merely sold coins to."

2015-08-25 22:38:40;Some questions about BIP100;"see: http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf

1.  Some of them are (""BIP100""), some more may be (""/BVsizeinbytes/""), and several others are not (""8M/"" etc.)  
2. In theory, yes - January 11th, 2016, same as BIP101  
3. In theory, yes - the proposal suggests a mechanism similar to that used in BIP34, which was the block version approach.
4. Starts off at 1MB, miners can then vote using /BVsizeinbytes/ up to 32MB.  Another hard fork could then be approached to lift the 32MB limit.  
5. a: Maybe, b: probably.  Explained further in the follow-up paragraphs.

Right now, there's no code in the wild that actually implements any of BIP100.  The answer to question 3, for example, is that it would probably use the block version for a vote - however, no block version or version bitset is suggested in the proposal.  In essence, the proposal is incomplete in terms of fostering an implementation.  See: http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010585.html .  Basically, it's a work in progress, and Jeff hopes to have something closer to a proposal that can be formalized and implemented soon.

Because of this, the answer to question 5(a) is that, right now, it's not likely that BIP100 is voted into effect because there's technically no voting mechanism at this time.  Miners who are signing their coinbase scriptSig with 'BIP100' are at best lending support to some form of BIP100.  
The question to 5(b) being 8MB is based on those miners who are using the '/BVsizeinbytes/' signature in their coinbase scriptSig, as suggested in the BIP100 proposal.  the 'sizeinbytes' has been '8000000' for most blocks (maybe all, haven't checked in a while)."
2015-08-25 22:28:06;FPGA vs ASIC.;"[deleted]Cpu gpu fpga asic

Each jump was like a million xAn FPGA is a development tools, usually coming in the form of a full featured board with of course the FPGA itself but also network connectors, USB, VGA, dip switches, LED display, etc. It's used as a development and experiment platform. When the development is over and you are ready for production, you send your schematics to a manufacturer who will produce ASICS, the end result of development. The ASIC is much cheaper and much faster since it's a refined and optimized products and doesn't come with all the dev features of an FPGA.
  
Today you would use an FPGA to develop a mining platform and once you are ready you would ask a manufacturer to produce 10.000 or 100.000 ASICS for your mining boards.
  
An FPGA is targeted at developers. An ASIC is targeted at consumers."

2015-09-22 23:52:31;Taler: A GNU attempt at replacing Bitcoin;"This is not a replacement for Bitcoin.

This is a classical centralized electronic cash system of the same kind as digicash; and thus shares the same weaknesses; including the strongly trusting a centralized operator and the inability to respect the basic human right of property ownership that comes from the centralized mint's ability to selectively deny transactions.  (A harm which is only weakly mitigated by cryptographic unlinkability since the _user_ can be coerced to disclose linkages at any time by the mint refusing further transactions.)

[As an aside, in their current codebase I don't actually see any implementation of blind signing, just boring x509 stuff-- but the capabilities discussed in their marketing stuff certainly makes it sound like its intended to become an actual ecash system]

The claims about being able to be taxed seem likely spurious as well, at least in the strong sense.  In that one could use multiparty computation to move funds entirely via the remininting operations in spite of the linked key requirement. Even ignoring MPC, closing off side-channel ways of transferring funds directly will likely require substantially limiting the system's capabilities (e.g. no smart contracts, probably no multisignature) if its even possible at all; and this on top of a costly-to-operate ""identity"" framework (which itself, is also not terribly compatible with human rights-- in our world where the ability to speak and act anonymously is often essential to having meaningful freedoms). To prevent technological bypasses the obvious logical step is to try to use technical measures like remote attest to prevent users from modifying the operation of their wallets.

The whole notion of integrated tracking for tax collection as a value add is at odds with how tax collection and enforcement actually works in practice: Tax collection is generally accomplished through self-reporting, auditing, and stiff penalties for cheating and not by baking Orwellian surveillance into our money itself.  While it's true that people do at times successfully cheat tax collection, using technological measures to attempt to enforce the rules will not change that fact, only change the specific mechanisms which people use to cheat. Additionally, real tax systems also involve complex rules which shouldn't be implemented in a low level transfer system and if they are implemented result in trivial bypasses (consider the tax implications for gifts and personal loans in the US system as an example).

I'm somewhat surprised to see this listed as a GNU project, especially with this particular sales pitch for its virtues. The system's design requires all users perform their activities via a central server whose operation they cannot control.  When presented as an _alternative_ to systems like Bitcoin, and described for applications where users could not voluntarily opt out of using it this could be seen as a particularly strong example of a Service as a Software Substitute.

I think there is a good place in the world for auditable centralized clearing systems, e.g. as ancillary tools for high throughput and low value working hand in hand with decentralized systems... so I'm sad to see what could perhaps be useful technology presented for applications in a way which specifically emphasizes making ill-use of its shortcomings and amplifies the potential for harm by imposing centralized control directly in the center of the mainstream transactions between people.Will gain as much traction as Freicoin.""Taler ensures that governments can easily track their citizen's income and thus collect sales, value-added or income taxes.

1. Let the catalog service charge owners for registering, validating and publishing their content, including payment metadata, e.g. content hashes/signatures, price per bandwidth (incentive which goes to seeders) and price per download (which goes to he owner).

2. Change the [Joystream] client to check the content registries that the user trusts (IMDB or whoever), validate the signature and adhere to the payment metadata that's been published for this content, essentially enforcing a ""legal mode"".

3. Work through a ton of legal hurdles(?).

4. ...

5. Profit! Bye, bye, dinosaurs.This is incredibly interesting. 

So anyone who seeds can charge bitcoins to do it? And anyone who wants good seeds can pay bitcoin to get them?

>I'm founder of Joystream, the AirBnB of BitTorrent. 

Better to call it the PayPal of BitTorrent. A fusion of Bitcoin and BitTorrent: CoinTorrent.This is popular idea with peer-to-peer electronic cash, but it is unclear how it is implemented.

I would imagine it would resemble:

1. Establish connection to peer
2. Setup a micropayment channel with the peer
3. The seeder requires updating the balance of the channel for a set number of bytes transmitted before sending data.
4. The peer sends data request with an updated balance
5. Seeder sends data
6. Repeat 4 and 5 until the channel is exhausted or expiresThis would be a killer for livestreaming too. People would gladly pay for watching live sports. Acetorrent + Bitcoin now this shit is gonna blow up. I see it. Wow. This might kill Youtube and Netflix. And Spotify and Itunes. This could be the internet of media. In the same way that bitcoin could turn into the backbone of all financial transactions that anyone can interface with, bittorrent married with bitcoin could become the backbone of all media dissemination. 

If we develop a good way for creators to get payed, they could release their content into bittorrent for anyone to download, and higher layer services could 1) act as light wrappers around it with search and discovery, or 2) act as a heavy service built on top of it that provides more complicated, centralized service (similar to how coinbase or circle operate). Then every single one of these clients has access to the same media that everyone else has and suddenly they need to compete by provide the best experience for the user, rather than being the only place you can get the content.

I would imagine that the majority of Torrents being downloaded these days, popular movies/tv show etc. are already seeded quite healthily.

I see this service only useful for Torrents which are very poorly seeded, which again leads to the fact that they aren't popular in the first place.

Really like the idea though! It's pretty clever.why would anyone pay if they can get it for free?Guys I'm seeding this torrent: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/15.04/release/lubuntu-15.04-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent

Something like [Popcorn Time](https://popcorntime.io/) but with a reward to seed would be handy.   Like PT, please be ready to open source it if/when the MPAA lawyers show up at your door.

Last time I looked into this it seemed like the bittorrent community was generally against financial incentives to seed.  There are some good arguments for this point of view, but I still think it's worth trying.one of the coolest products for bitcoin, cool!If you get paid for seeding doesn't that raise the level of criminal seriousness? Don't get me wrong, I love the idea and I think you're on to a future technology. I just don't want to get thrown in jail for doing it.bad idea.... against the idea of torrents in my humble opinion

2015-10-06 23:49:52;Take it from a recovering Bitcoin Remittance startup guy: Bitcoin doesn't actually make remittances cheaper;"I see why you should want to eliminate bitcoin from the process to make it streamlined for users, but the real magic happens when we eliminate fiat from the process.I use bitcoin to send money home every month from Korea.  I save anywhere from 40-50 dollars a month doing it.  I buy off Korbit then transfer it to Circle and then withdrawal.  Easy as that.  In my experience it is cheaper. I live in Korea, but from Korbit and send it to Circle. It's nearly free, not expensive like other banking services.So... The content of the article is better than it's headline.

TL;DR: Opening kiosks and mimicking a traditional remittance business is expensive. Regulations. Rents. Lots of work. ""The last mile"" issue is still very expensive when dealing with fiat-fiat (using bitcoin only behind the scenes). 

Cheap settlement is not enough to become competitive with established players.Great article. The thesis here is that bitcoin makes a big leg of the transfer cheaper, but the last mile is the tricky part, and Bitcoin has not yet solved it. > Outside of Bitcoin, what other solutions exist? Mobile money seems to be most practical candidate. It replaces the dependency on a physical last mile with that of an over-the-air, good-as-cash technology. Unfortunately, itâs tough to find a really successful implementation of mobile money outside of Kenyaâs MPesa, and perhaps Zimbabweâs EcoCash. 

Access to cash-dispensing Bitcoin ATMs would be a good substitute.   I use Bitcoin for remittance as well. I work in Europe for a US company that pays me in dollars.
I have my paycheck converted to bitcoins via BitWage for 1%. Then I charge 10% to sell bitcoins for euros via localbitcoins.
My co-workers pay 5% conversion fee via the bank plus wire transfer and ATM fees.Western union said as much years ago. They said bitcoin doesn't do anything for them because getting cash in people's hands is the really tough part. [deleted]This is an extremely biased article since it refers to a very specific use case in the Philippines and trying to mimic the very particular remittances industry there, then it generalise it's conclusions.

Wrong.

In countries like Spain and Romania the last mile has been completely solved thanks to companies like bit2me.com that leverage on the existing ATM network to cover the last mile at extremely cheap operating costs for them. If you innovate instead of mimic them this happens. > The perfect solution appears to be a hybrid between the current Bitcoin remittance startups and the ubiquitous mobile-money network that currently exists only in our dreams.

Or... y'know, individuals sending Bitcoin to each other without a brick-and-mortar middle-man. Remittance companies are an intermediate step, not the end goal. Ideally the receiving folks would be able to pay their utilities (and other services) in Bitcoin so they wouldn't have to convert stuff back. That will require a country with high inflation and high remittance inflows. I'm not sure what country fits that description though.Take it from someone who remitted before bitcoin and now remits with bitcoin. Bitcoin makes remittance cheaper.> Rebitâs model (and the model of several other companies like it) was to eliminate Bitcoin from the end-userâs perspective. 

I think I see the problem.Just create a sort of bitpay company for consumers. Dont bother working both sides of the system. They should only bother accepting bitcoins for the end user and transferring to bank accounts.So, when you attempted to mimic the service that you are trying to replace it didn't work out? 

As long as we picture the ""fiat in hand"" as the endgame things aren't going to work out. >associating Bitcoin so directly with cheaper remittances is perhaps missing the point: the cryptocurrency has illuminated an even larger problem that it simply cannot solve on its own.

Within the framework of the fiat to bitcoin exchange process, perhaps. *Perhaps*. To say for sure is to say that you have truly perfected all possible routes of innovation in this fledgling space. Do you have the hubris to think that you have indeed accomplished that? 

But ultimately, sending bitcoin itself is what will solve all of these problems that you mention. The problem is the friction caused unnecessarily by onerous and lumbering regulation.. Unneeded obstacles that exist merely as a relic of an archaic technology, to the detriment of all. 

People need merely to *believe* in digital currency, and to do that the industry is slowly building systems to incentivize them to do that. Easier ways to secure it, send it, and so on. Building liquidity in exchange markets to stabilize prices and encourage acceptance. It won't be an overnight process, we realize that. 

Detractors to bitcoin say that we bitcoiners are looking through rose colored glasses, but I say that it is they who need to take their blinders off, and realize that each one of these problems is an entrepreneurial opportunity that is more readily addressed and profited from by the use of freely exchangeable digital money. But this will change the more stores in the philipines accept bitcoin.. then people wouldn't need to change it to local currency anymoreDisappointing to hear but glad to get what sounds like an honest assessment outside of the echo chamber.> [*bitcoin doesn't make FX fees and spreads cheaper]

True dat. :Pbitcoin can make remittances cost virtually nothing if there is the infrastructure to do so. For example I buy 50$ worth of bitcoin from a source like circle, keep it denominated in dollars and send it to another account that is able to pull it out in any currency for a small fee. The problem is the existing financial infrastructure makes international finance expensive. Im sure there will be people who have smarter solutions than mine that will work out better.I just hit my limit on Xoom for sending money. So sometimes its not about cheaper its about limits.Well, he did kind of admit that Bitcoin->Bitpesa->Mpesa works due to being able to use the mobile money network. 

I really don't understand the mobile money network in the Philippines enough to make a judgement on it.Having only used circle, wouldn't remittance be very nearly free if another country had something like circle? This author is making a statement about an industry in general based off one specific company. Yeah, I've always wondered about those ""Rebittance"" startups that wanted to eliminate Bitcoin from the end user perspective. The last mile is exactly the problem.   
   
Bitcoin is designed to cut out middlemen. That also goes for this kind of startups. Migrant workers have to learn to use Bitcoin directly, that's the only thing that will work.I think the idea with bitcorn's is to not use fiat at all.  So a business model involving a marriage between fiat and bitcoin doesn't work?  Color me surprised.A fully functioning Bitcoin economy in which bitcoin is used on both sides of the last mile eliminates the need for startups like Rebit.ph.

Take out the middleman and you cancel his paycheck. It's a tough lesson that, ironically, ""mass adoption"" would impose rather indiscriminately.When BTC goes mainstream, we wont need terminals and such for remittances. People will just send and spend.My personal case:

When I send money from my GBP bank account to my EUR bank account, I pay:

1. Sending: 10 GBP for any amount under 5000 GBP
2. Sending: A hidden fee in the form of the bank's ""own forex quote"" (which is 3%)
3. Receiving: 0.021% on the received amount, with a minimum of 10 EUR and a ceiling of 150 EUR

The above usually results in a fee of 5 to 5.5%.

When I use bitcoin, I can do the following:

1. Buy XBT with GBP on Localbitcoins (2.5%)
2. Sell XBT for EUR on Dutch exchange (2%)easy fix. everyone starts pricing things in bitcoin, no more remit. It's the only wayThis remittance guy failed because he is trying take a piece of the pie, and is piecing off multiple players along the way.

Bitcoin is perfect for this market. It just is not perfect when there are guys trying to make money off the process.

Here is how the perfect market exists:

1)Buyer of bitcoin sends money to an exchange. Many exchanges offer a free method of doing this.

2)Buyer buys bitcoin for an exchange fee at the market of approximately .5 of 1%.

3)Buyer sends money to recipient for free.

4)Receiver sells bitcoin at market rates and pays another half a percent.

5)Receiver transfers funds from exchange to his bank account for nominal fee.

Total costs are usually between 1-2%.

Eliminate the middle man and eliminate the costs.Silly statement, every country has different costs, some are insane.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQkqecYIAX8#t=12m37s

Ya'll can email me before you start your businesses and just ask me if they'll work. I'll happily explain this stuff to you before you jump into the rabbit holes.An interesting blog post from SaveOnSend, which pretty much says the same thing (but with a whole lot more analytical evidence behind it): https://www.saveonsend.com/blog/bitcoin-money-transfer/this is how buttcoiners are formedSounds to me like it's not cheaper because the incumbents are dicks. So the best solution: fix the last mile = settle in Bitcoin (this is where Bitcoin progressing comes in as being accepted everywhere and spendable) and where remittances are much less required.

2015-10-20 23:49:20;Bitcoin and capital gains tax;"The tumber/mixer does not change anything with respect to your responsibility to report capital gains.
Yes. after you buy goods with btc profit you need to pay tax on the gain.

Capital gains tax rate is not 50% (assuming you are in the US). 

Ordinary dividend and short-term capital gain: Tax rate is same as ordinary income tax rate.
Long-term capital gain: Tax rate is 0% for the 10%â15% brackets; 15% for the 25%â35% brackets; and 20% for the 39.6% bracket.
You have to throw some tea in the harbor first to avoid taxation of your bitcoin.It's no different from stocks.  When you sell you figure out the difference in price and pay cap gains on that.  Buying something with Bitcoin is the exact same as selling it the only difference is what you're selling it for but it makes no difference to your calculations.

And yes trying to avoid it is illegal.  Like go to federal prison illegal.Depends where you live.

In the US, for example, the IRS has declared virtual currencies as capital assets, so all Bitcoin trades or spending is a tax event, and you have to work out any potential capital gains.

So whenever you sell Bitcoin, you need to take the difference of the money you made less the value of the coins when you bought them. This is your profit (or loss). 

Any profits are taxed as capital gains. This is long-term gains if you held the coins for more than a year, at a rate of 0% - 20% depending on your other income. Or, short-term, a year or less, where it is just taxed as income.

Tumbling makes no difference. If you are doing it to not pay taxes, it's just tax fraud.

If you buy something with Bitcoin, for taxes, it's treated no different than if you sold those coins for USD. You still could owe capital gains taxes.

See https://bitcoin.tax for more information.

2015-11-10 23:59:39;Testnet Fork Identity Crisis;"We have been deliberately testing the hardfork process to see how it works by turning on and off BIP101-based hashrate, and occasionally hashing on the legacy (Core) chain. Sometimes other people have been hashing on the Core chain too, especially sometime in the last 10 hours. With the drastic difficulty adjustments that happen on testnet (e.g. 100000 difficulty for one block, then 1 for the next), and the fact that difficulty is dependent on the node's timestamp (which can and does get manipulated) rather than the block height, things are pretty chaotic. Most of the chaos is just testnet being testnet, and not related to the hard fork. Most of the rest of the chaos is intentionally caused by us because we want to make sure that the behavior is correct despite everything we throw at it.My guess is somebody directed a massive hashing power toward it to active XT but blocks are generated with the old difficulty.The block explorers have gotten all sorts of confused. They're not reliable because they seem to not pay attention to the chain-with-most-work rule.

While we were mining on BIP101, we saw the Core chain quickly pass us up with about 2,000 blocks mined in rapid succession with difficulty around 1.6. I got rather confused by that, but even though Core was over 1000 blocks ahead of XT, all of the XT nodes stayed together.

We had some difficulty goofs of our own, too. At some point, we crossed a difficulty adjustment border. A few other people mined some blocks when I was otherwise busy, and then when I was ready to mine, I didn't know the difficulty was different. I pointed a half SP10 at my poolserver, and then mined at up to 100 blocks per second. Many of the blocks arrived at other nodes in reverse order. It was interesting.

Later, I got the CPU mining thing worked out, and we mined about 6 full 9.1 MB blocks in a row. We had a reorg in the middle of it, though, so I think we were having some connectivity problems from insufficient node coverage. One of my nodes also wasn't following the rest for a bit.

When it functions properly, it seems that block propagation for 8 MB blocks may be around the 5s to 15s mark. It appears that a lot of that time is due to block validation; the network transit time appears to be pretty low in our configuration. TCP slow start does not appear to be as much of an issue as I was expecting.

I'm currently not mining on XT because I found that leaving it for CPU mining when possible was more convenient.

Edit: I'll post a transcript from #bitcoinxt of today's testing on /r/bitcoinxt in a bit.Welp. Success I guess.It looks like my first comment got automodded away. Maybe it will show up later? Maybe not.related: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3sdw17/testnet_recent_forks_data/More details on the reorg after the fork can be found on another post which might or might not be censored/automoderated by this forum. I'll try to post a link in a reply to this comment in 10 seconds.

I'm still tracking down what went on while I was asleep. If you think my understanding of what happened is incorrect, let me know. I'd appreciate the help.Great job guys.  So glad you tested this literally just before activation started becoming a possibility instead of doing this before you even started rolling out the code to everybody's boxes.  If people actually wanted BIP101 this could have been a complete disaster."

2015-11-10 23:32:44;New to BTC, got a question.;"Nobody can predict shit. Don't buy into something based on hype.

My advice to you: Take some time and research bitcoin properly. Look at both sides of the coin - don't just read this sub but read other places that are anti-bitcoin also. Weigh up the arguments and determine if you see a positive future for bitcoin. 

If you see a positive future - hold an amount that you are willing to lose and do not need to use in the long term. If you don't - sell out and forget about bitcoin.
If you believe that Bitcoin will be successful in the long term, over the next several years, then the price will be much higher than it is now in which case you should just hold on to your investment. Of course you should never invest more than you are willing to lose.No, you need to be an oldfag... 

As soon as you sell it will go back up.

Source: experience. 

Sorry for my rudeness, but what do you expect if you make a post like is this is 4chan... 

TL,DR: don't invest more than you are willing to hold for some years.No one knows. Nobody could predict neither the ""bubble"" or the ""pop"", there is some theories, but nobody really knows.

Buying Bitcoin is gambling at this point."

2015-11-24 23:49:44;My exchange with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong;"Putting a centralized payment processor on the payment path makes things easier and solves some problems-- but you've seen a (small) taste of the real cost.

I don't say this to speak negatively of Coinbase: they have their own challenges which make providing a service fitting your needs hard. But part of the point of Bitcoin is that just because Coinbase can't or won't do what you need that shouldn't leave you stuck. Their-- and  similar companies-- exposure situation and risk profile is very different from yours. E.g. The civil rights related defenses are much stronger in your hands than in coinbase's.

Much of the unfortunate realpolitik regulatory pressure in the developed world comes from making life hard for institutions if they do certain kinds of business, so they, justifiably, execute their freedom to associate and decline to do business with targeted parties (plus a lot of others, as collateral damage). Often the pressure is nested many levels deep, so good luck finding out for sure where it's actually being applied. Because there was, technically, no actual restraint or an identifiable discriminatory action by a government authority, you are disempowered to correct the injustice; even if you've been left with no options. Personally, it is my hope for autonomy enhancing technology to reduce the need for vulnerable choke-points and prevent that kind of erosion of practical personal freedom and perversion of due process.

Since it sounds like Bitcoin could actually be important to your business and not just a Me-Too payment method, you may want to consider handling this directly without using third party APIs. From a overall system risk perspective it would be better for Bitcoin if more people did this, and for situations like yours the benefits are especially acute.

Unfortunately, because the vast majority just do the ""easy thing"" and rely on one of the few large payment processors the software infrastructure and educational materials for handling this yourself are underdeveloped today. :(

As a developer of Bitcoin Core I've been working on improving node behavior to make it easier and less costly for to merchants to run their own nodes and handle accepting payments on their own via tools like https://github.com/slickage/baron . Many improvements for this application space will ship in Bitcoin Core 0.12 in a couple months. But there is a lot of work left to do to make it really the experience that you should have.  I'd like to have more real world feedback from people attempting to do this in order to further guide improving the experience. Without people taking a step to try to make it work and giving feedback this approach will remain underdeveloped.

In a recent discussion I was asked about what I thought Bitcoin's value was to the world and I spoke about autonomy, monetary sovereignty, personal control over trust, etc. Another person responded they thought Bitcoin was great for payment because paying with Bitcoins made them feel right-- I responded paying with Bitcoin _used_ to feel right -- in 2011, but these days I've found the payment processors ask technically unnecessary invasive questions (and then presumably secure my personally identifiable information in questionable ways) which undermines much of that value. I'd like to turn back the clock on that, especially for sensitive areas where providing a more safe and secure payment method isn't just easier and good for business but magnifies people's freedom of expression, such as yours.Can someone clarify what rule coinbase is  enforcing here? it's a rule passed on to them by their partnering bankers?Third party risk is third party risk is third party risk I still haven't figured out why they closed your account, after skimming everything.  I just hear these very broad generalization.Every week or so there is a post of someone angry at Coinbase or Circle for something similar.  They are simply doing what they feel they need to do to stay out of legal trouble.

The anger really should be directed to people like Ben Lawsky, politicians and people and organizations who, right now, in our own industry are actually proactively ASKING for MORE regulation.

Regulations are no joke.  It's easy from the sidelines to talk about fighting the system and making a new breed of company.  The cold reality is that the regulators can completely and utterly destroy any company in Bitcoin if they feel like it.  

If they really want to, state actors could likely put anyone in this industry in jail.  There is a book titled ""Three Felonies a Day"" that estimates that the average American commits three felonies daily.  Charlie Shrem is currently in jail for failure to file a form that deemed that a customer was suspicious -- Charlie sold bitcoins to that customer ...who in turn sold it to other people...who used it on Silk Road, most likely for drugs.  His crime was not filing a form that reported this as suspicious.  Meanwhile, HSBC had a special teller window installed at a branch near the Mexican border so that cartel members could fit large suitcases of cash through to deposit over $300 million.  Yet no one from HSBC went to jail.   Charlie was targeted simply because he is in this industry and was well known.  Despite him meeting with Lawsky nearly once a week, having lawyers and proactively working to comply, he was made an example of.

Fortunately today's Bitcoin CEOs face less chance of jail time but they still face the harsh reality that the State can destroy thier business.  I'm sure some companies wish the regs were less but they feel a responsibility to employees, customers and shareholders to avoid problems.What is wrong with adult websites anyway? I never understood WHY banks don't like this business.. 

Did you ever get an explanation on this topic from a bank?Appears like you need to use https://gear.mycelium.com as your payment processor.You talk to them like they can just do whatever they want and have infinite resources.

Not even Coinbase can just walk up to banks and say ""Hey! Wanna bank us?"" And have that happen. Bitcoin is seen as incredibly risky - the banks they already have may seem super conservative, but are actually about as forward-thinking as a bank can possibly be in the US, strictly by virtue of the fact that they're backing a bitcoin company at all.

On top of that they can't fight your battle for you. It's a competitive market and they probably properly recognize that they should be working on building their product, and not martyring themselves for merchants that don't make a difference to their bottom line.

I think you have plenty to be disappointed in, but I think the blame is improperly placed on the bitcoin company (any of them), when it should be on the regulation that they're forced to abide by.Have you still access to your Bitcoin or not?> I should mention that we are probably at fault for marketing it ...

It really seems to come down to an communication issue. I'm fine with almost any arbitrary rule a provider requires, as long as it's communicated properly.

In an ideal scenario, I'd wish:

- to know these rules right from the start
- in this case this means: stating clearly which services are not allowed on CB
- this may even be part of the sign-up process, e.g. in form of a checkbox such as ""I hereby declare my business is not xyz..""

And for a good customer experience, I'd wish that:

- my support messages are not ignored
- I receive an answer within a reasonable amount of time
- there is a bit of insight, especially in a case like this, which helps me to understand why this or that happens
- edit: bonus points for a personal experience

It seems like a waste of time for all involved parties, starting from OP, Reddit users and even the Coinbase CEO needed to get involved, even though this isn't this first time something like this happened. Managing expectations and clear communication is key in my opinion..Guess i won't be using coinbase anymore. It's the PayPal of Bitcoin.What about this? What if you used Coinbase to handle payments, but not convert bitcoin to fiat for you -- rather, they just hold the payments to you in bitcoin.Then you pay all your artist in bitcoin and they what they will to convert on their own, or not. That way Coinbase would not be interacting with the bank regulations on your account. ?? Would that work for you?Why would you use Coinbase to accept payments? You should have just used a regular wallet or mycelium tools. Then just used Coinbase for selling.There is definitely room for improvement with Coinbase.  The OP handled himself well and had a valid argument.  I also appreciate Brian's response as he clearly senses frustration from a reasonable person.  I hope with time Coinbase can improve their service.  I would say that if you expect Coinbase to be fully transparent, be prepared to be fully transparent yourself.  For Coinbase, they have to operate on the side of caution so they don't risk shut down for all their merchantsThe best thing in bitcoin is that it's no need to have ""all in one"" solution. I use web wallet and independent exchange broker allowing me to instantly deposit/withdraw any time I need.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3u68oo/coinbase_ceo_responds_to_a_merchant/> Accepting purely bitcoin-to-bitcoin payments would be one solution that might work for this if that is what you want (there are plenty of other solutions other than Coinbase for this).

MeThinks you're not listening to well, OP. Coinbase is doing what they feel they have to do. Why not just leave the bitcoin-to-bank mess yourself, and set up a bitcoin-to-bitcoin mechanism that gives you what you want?> For a company like ours the whole appeal of Bitcoin is the anonymity, so our readers don't have to worry about buying lewd comics and having it show up on their statements.

How about not putting ""LEWDCOMICS"" in the company name when charging their credit cards through Stripe or PayPal?  Most companies where privacy makes sense have enough sense to obscure the merchant name.I'm 100Pct sure you would have the same issues with bitpay.

there is basically no competition in this space. so its completely understandable that they have 0 reason to attempt to service you. Any customers that have even the slightness chance of getting any additional attention from regulators are getting the boot. They wont service you because they don't have to compete. They know you aren't going to go to some one else because you cant. they don't care what you have to say because they don't have to compete with anyone.
I keep saying Coinbase is no good. I feel your plight, its a problem, but surely you don't want **all** Coinbase merchants to lose their accounts because you want Coinbase to refuse compliance with their bank? Because that is what will happen. It's clearly not Coinbase's fault.

And if you keep all your btc as btc, why not just accept directly and stop using a 3rd party service? That is what it was created for ...[deleted]"

2015-12-01 23:50:44;I keep hearing about the Lightning Network as a solution to our block size woes, but can it run without a middle man?;"> Is the lightning network a feature that still allows P2P transactions without an account or connection to another service

No signup is needed - you'll generate the private keys exactly as you do normally in your Bitcoin wallet, and use these private keys to sign Bitcoin transactions.

But similar to how you can't use Tor without connecting to the Tor network, you can't use LN without connecting to the Lightning Network. In an onion routing configuration of LN, similar to [Tor Bridges](https://bridges.torproject.org/), you would connect to the Lightning Network through a bridge.

Once you have a connection established with the bridge, the bridge connects you to relays which can bounce your payment destination around to similar relays, akin to how [Tor Relays](https://atlas.torproject.org/#about) work.

As your payment hops around the relays, intended for the recipient, each LN relay partially decrypts until an LN exit node is found. That node will know how to route your payment to your intended recipient.

OP, it would behoove you to further consider OT, launching as [Stash](https://stashcrypto.com/):

> Stash is a transaction platform you don't have to trust.

It's like Coinbase, except without depositing any money and it includes smart contracts. OT hubs are likely to launch before Lightning is ready.You may want to listen to this [interview with the two main authors](http://www.bitcoin.kn/2015/11/lightning-network-architects-dryja-poon-discuss-scaling-bitcoin/) of the whitepaper.It will be similar to how SPV clients must always use a full node. You can run a node yourself if you want, but you might find it more convenient to not do that. It should be more secure than SPV clients are today because it will be underpinned with full validation and it won't need to skip steps.You won't need an account. Wallets will be similar to today's wallets. Transactions will be processed via nodes. There's no custodial risk, meaning these nodes will not be able to seize your funds. There's one soft fork underway and another one (two?) soft forks in the pipeline before the real work can begin. There are multiple teams collaborating, and I expect we'll see lots of testing over next year. No, it has a middle man in much the same way miners are middle men in on-chain transactions...

Not the same thing, but quite similar in many ways."

Luckily, the white one worked.I ordered a trezor a month ago and also got a pink usb cable. [deleted]My cable was white, but of a very poor quality. They even included a little note that stated the cable could be broken and that I should try another cable before contacting support if the device didn't work.nsa probably threw a pink one back in the box because they broke the original because the connection wasn't tight. /sMine stopped working completely after a short period of time.

The Trezor is great...but the cables they include are chinese crap...buy a better cable...I required a longer one.Will you be putting most of your bitcoin on it? How easy is it to use?my trezor made a rattling noise, but I think it was just some ""play "" or ""backlash"" between the buttons/switches/case.

I tried putting a finger lightly on the buttons and shook again, no noise for me. Electronic internals are not rattling.My cables were purple. They included a hefty black one which works great, but I replaced it with a slimmer one of decent quality for $5 or so. [deleted]My cable was blue, and the quality sucked.
Did you by any chance mention in the order form you were a queer? That could explain the color of your cable

Initially through being one of the most effective means to export wealth across boarders. Then by the mass realisations that it is has the ability to become the premier store of wealth in this world of heavily manipulated gold & silver markets. Since the announcement that the Chinese Yuan is to be included into the IMF's SDR on October 1st 2016 I'm of the mind the PBoC has a clear target they would like to see Yuan trading in before they step away from the market, This article published shortly after the CNY devaluation on the 10th of August this year makes the suggestion that trading range is 7.5CNY to 1USD & we are currently around 6.4, so we could see another 17.5% decrease in the Yuan's value over the coming 6 months. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-25/china-quietly-targeting-20-devaluationwell actually it's the other way round and therefor easier. traders expect a fed interest rate hike. that means stronger usd and weaker yuan. weaker yuan means chinese buy more btc. that wasnt that difficult now was it?Most indicators on most levels point to a sustainable price increase, time to buy one bitcoin, also good time to buy silver and gold coins.> only this time, everyone and their pet rabbit is neck-deep in ""priced in"" liftoff expectations.

Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.
There's a number of ways to think about Bitcoin.  The easiest way is to think of it as a commodity, like gold, but that is on the computer, and even though it's on the computer and can be transfered via the internet, it still has the non-computer property of not being able to be copied.  So when somebody sends you bitcoins, you actually have a real tangible asset, NOT a digital copy of something.

The way that all works, and the reason the commodity Bitcoin has value, is the protocol behind Bitcoin, aka the blockchain.  Bitcoin is not backed by anything -- you can't just go trade them in for dollars or gold.  People *do* trade them for that because they believe Bitcoin has value.  But that value is completely self-derived.

I personally believe that value comes from the usefulness of that blockchain technology and how it works -- the fact that it enables payments and data to be moved without being ""copied"".  Other people think it's valuable for other reasons, and some people think it's not valuable at all and we're all fools for believing in it.

The difficult thing for understanding Bitcoin in every way but the price/value aspects, is that, in terms of the technology and how it works, everything is all mixed together into one thing, and so it's often difficult to separate them when you're talking about Bitcoin.

As for being safe -- well that depends on how good you are with your security.  People get hacked all the time.  And since Bitcoin is an actual commodity on your computer (that's not technically true, but it's the easiest way to think about it) -- since it's actually on your computer, if you get hacked and lose it, it's really gone.  There's no way to get it back, no government or insurance company that will refund you.  It's just gone.  Some people like to store their money with other people, like exchanges like Coinbase or Bitstamp, and trust that those institutions will not lose them, or at least that they can be sued if they do lose them.  Some people print out the data that represents the Bitcoins onto pieces of paper and then delete the Bitcoin from their computer, so now they have Bitcoin in the physical world, on pieces of paper, protected from computer hacking.

And some other people use a neat optional property of Bitcoin that makes it so multiple people must agree on how the Bitcoin is spent in order for it to move at all, so if any one of them is hacked, the Bitcoin is still safe.

As for it's value... that's just what one person is willing to buy and another is willing to sell for.  There is no ""official"" value.  The way I determine the ""actual"" value is I go look at a bunch of exchanges and take the average of the price that people traded it for most recently.  Most recently, that was about $410.

As for buying it, there are government-licensed exchanges like Coinbase and Bitstamp and Gemini, and there are unlicensed exchanges, and there are forums where people just agree to meet and trade in person -- there's pretty much every way you can imagine.  The difficulty most people have is that people who sell Bitcoin will usually not let you use a credit card or Paypal to buy from them.  The reason is really simple -- they buy the Bitcoin, then once they have the Bitcoin, they call their credit card company or e-mail Paypal and say ""that wasn't me, that was a hacker or identity thief, please reverse that charge"", and the company *does* reverse it, and now the seller is out the Bitcoin and the credit card or paypal payment.  (And often times, it really *was* a hacker that stole their info, and used that to get Bitcoins.)  Bitcoins trades cannot be reversed.  Think of it like using cash on the street -- once you give it to somebody it's gone.  So either the person you trade with, like most in person traders, will only accept cash, or they are big companies/exchanges and require all kinds of identifying documents.

Don't feel bad -- Bitcoin is overwhelming and hard to understand.  And it's hard to get any, and it's hard to learn how it works.  That's all just a function of it still being relatively new.  Watch the videos other people have posted, read forums, keep asking questions, and little by little you'll get more and more knowledgeable.Someone will eventually come along here and tell you that the proper spelling is ""Bitcoin"" (not BitCoin). Now you're prepared for that. [This has info but hard to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lp0d3/i_got_my_local_community_college_to_offer_a/)

2015-12-08 23:49:32;Dr. Craig Steven Wright (alleged Satoshi, by Wired) on YouTube, from Bitcoin Investor Conference at Las Vegas;"How did he get on this panel in the first place?  I smell a conspiracy brewing.If Satoshi forgot his wallet password, would he use a supercomputer crack it? :)

Part about the supercomputer: https://youtu.be/LdvQTwjVmrE?t=2115

Something went wrong with the audio at the end of his answer, did he say he will release a paper next year?When the lady says, ""But hold on a second, who are you? ...""
The camera pans by Nick Szabo who looks straight ahead with his hands crossed in front of his mouth like ""Uh oh, here we go...""""Are you a miner?""
""A long time ago.""
lolCan someone with some CS background confirm his response on the subject of thinking bigger, and using 2 hashes, or assigning monetary value to a public key.

I just got the vibe that he was mish mashing concepts to come across a knowledgeable, or maybe he is far ahead of everyone.

BUt the impression I got was not of someone with a truly deep bitcoin knowledge, ala /u/nullc /u/petertodd or gavin.  Then again the real Satoshi maybe so far behind in development of bitcoin and where its at the his is probably a novice in relationship to were bitcoin is.

Also the dropping that we have a supercomputer in Iceland, just very odd.I think I just figured out something that was bothering me: How did Craig Wright become a speaker at a Bitcoin conference when nobody knew anything about him yet? Someone who received leaked documents must have tipped off someone who was running this conference to get in touch with him for the panel. The conference was about a month ago and coincidentally they said the investigation has been going on for a month. He was not actually at the event which means he may have been even invited to be on the panel at the last minute.

Further evidence: Why do you invite some guy who can't even make the panel in person and nobody has heard of to be on a panel at a conference? You must know something that not everyone knows.

Also during the Q&A Steve Michaels asks Craig a question about something he posted on Twitter recently. How and why was Steven Michaels so aware of who Craig is, why was he following him on Twitter, and how was Craig the focus of so many questions when you've got Nick Szabo sitting right there?He mentions one of the benefits of bitcoin as good for those 'not wanting people to know I am a billionaire'this video is so painful to watch. 
I don't know whats more cringe worthy, that woman, or the so called Satoshi! This man acts nothing like how Satoshi wrote. His arrogance is the giveaway. Doesn't know all of the degrees he has? Pffft.Why do they have someone giving the interviews that obviously doesn't understand computer science He sure appears to have the right temperament.  Independent, clear-headed, big-picture, detailed thinker to the max.I actually watched most of this video a few weeks ago, but at the time I was thinking NS is SN. So wasn't focused on the big guy on the screen :)But isn't Satoshi a time traveller anyway? I mean: The pdf on bitcoin.org was created 2009:03:24 11:33:15-06:00. But it was posted in the Internet in November 2008. So Satoshi is above time...What of the theory that Craig Wright = the Mystery whale GAW/Paycoin investor ""Craig"", who has long been rumored to be Hashtalk member Tankjnr AND he turns out to be Satoshi?

I am in awe how lucky we all are to know about these technologies before everyone else.... what to tell the grandkids.. lolAre you saying I'll be able to buy shares in APPL using bitcoin on Overstock.com? And even if Overstock.com crashes, everyone can see on the blockchain that I own so and so many shares in Apple?From an adoption standpoint its pretty big that the SEC has approved this.

However, I think we all fail to point out that *we don't need the SECs permission*. 

That is the entire point of the blockchain is it not? To free ourselves of bureaucratic oversight that is by and large useless and slow, and replace it with code. They have several total regulatory failures to account for, such as the disaster that was 2008, and the one coming next. This tech means any business of any size can issue their own assets without having to ask or pay giant premiums for the privilege from some faceless organization of the un-elected. For the moment I accept that SEC involvement is mandatory as it is still the current power structure. 

 I'll have to find it though I do believe I have read that the SEC did relax the rules for smaller businesses to issue crypto-assets of their own without reprise. At least the SEC does seem to be going along with these new technologies instead of fighting them, which is good. 

We have been able to issue colored-coins and similar stock-like smart assets for a while now with Counterwallet and other platforms, like Ethereum.What is going to happen, over the next few years as many many companies start using the Bitcoin Blockchain, as it relates to central banks or rather governments, not ""liking"" Bitcoin?

Incredible the possibilities here.so...is this more legit than craig wright, wired? /sCant wait to show my support for Patrick and buy some shares>   Overstock has already used the blockchain to issue private bonds, which did not require explicit regulatory approval.

>Public documents filed by Overstock show that the SEC has approved an amended Form S-3 that would allow the company to issue public securities via blockchain-based technology, and Byrne plans to announce the news this evening at a bitcoin conference in San Diego

2015-12-29 23:30:33;"@aantonop - ""Segregated witness is necessary but not sufficient. We must also raise the block size limit. Inaction is a radical re-shaping of bitcoin""";"Thank you Andreas for coming out and stating what most of us in the Bitcoin community believe.  Support from rational leaders in our community like you help cut through censorship.
Yes. Segwit elegantly deals with a number of issues that are important to eventually resolve, but a credible solution for scaling without running into artificial fee pressure is not one of them.

Also, we should understand that, soft fork or not, segwit is a big change to the ecosystem as a whole. It fundamentally revises the blockchain datastructure, introduces a totally new class of nodes between today's ""full nodes"" and ""spv clients"", and it creates a situation where products and services that don't re-code at a pretty basic level will no longer necessarily understand the full intended meaning of all transactions.

Again, from a computer science standpoint (my background), it's elegant and should ultimately be done for various reasons, but from a practical standpoint, it's a huge change for the ecosystem, and also does not credibly address the most important issue at hand today: scaling tx throughput without eliminating bitcoin's current free-market tx economics.Segwit is an optimization and not a solution to full blocks.  

Core seems to have no problem throwing the network and it's users into unknown territory through inaction on this critical issue, while shifting priorities to preparing Bitcoin to become a settlement network and limited in order to make their Lightning network profitable.The decision to raise or not raise the block size should be a technical one.  there is no technical reason not to raise the block size, to at lease 3MB.

BIP 102, should be scheduled to kick in 12 months. With SegWit and BIP 102, it should at least buy us a couple years.

Either we establish a process for scaling blocks, or we establish and hardfork process for increasing block size based on technical requirements that balance decentralization with bitcoin scaling.

Block size was never meant to be fixed.   
Is anyone seriously arguing that the blocksize should be fixed at 1mb forever?

As far as I can tell, most people agree that scalability is a good thing as long as it doesn't disrupt and over-centralize the network. The problem are the technical aspects and deciding the right approach to take moving forward which i think people seriously underestimate the complexity of.Inaction brought us XT, then theymus couldn't handle it and the community is now dividedWow pretty interesting development.Coming from r/all

Can someone explain like I'm 5?Seconded. 2M cap increase with Segwit is the first step to go.So he's finally come out of the closet.both are neededI disagree that without an immediate block size increase, bitcoin will be ""radically reshaped"" anytime soon. Transaction fees will go up slightly. We have a long way to go before fees become high enough to discourage people from using the protocol. How much time should it be repeated that nobody is against a bump ? The question is only whether to do IBLT and weak block before and it is possible, there is no urgency.Transaction volume is high because transactions are so cheap. If we hit the current cap, then the cost of having a transaction incorporated into the blockchain soon will rise. This cost will curb blockchain spammers and dustmen. I've got no problem with that. It's people that make miniscule transactions that will be affected the most. They have the least to lose by taking their trash off-chain.Someone needs to create a bot that does nothing but post Andreas tweets. They'd be swimming in link karma.Err nobody said it is sufficient, its one of many steps in roadmap. One of these steps is to also raise block-size. Can we just get on with things instead of arguing.

He likes being popular, and he has no spine.  He just says whatever he thinks will persuade the largest amount of you continue to blow kisses up his asshole.

He always finds some middle-of-the-road opinion to position himself as a compromiser who is above-it-all.  In truth, with developments taking place, all present fears of consequences from blocks filling are being alleviated by easy to implement developments.  Accordingly, there is obviously no pressing need to raise the cap.  Moreover, plans in development may make cap raising entirely unnecessary (and certainly will tell us how much is absolutely necessary).  Anyone can see this.  But there is still a loud group of butthurt dissenters who are angry they are not getting their way.  Enter Aantonop who has figured out a way to suck everyone off at the same time.

2016-01-05 23:05:11;ELI5 the blockchain size issue;"The debate isn't over the blockchain size, or the the block size directly.  The debate is over what the maximum allowable block size should be.  Until the existing block size limit is raised and/or other scaling solutions are implemented Bitcoin is limited to about 7 transactions per second.

Here are some historical facts leading up to the debate as neutrally as I think I can present them.

â¢ When Bitcoin was first created in 2009, there was no maximum block size.

â¢ In 2010 a limit of 1 MB was added by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto to prevent a largely theoretical DOS attack.

â¢ When the limit was added, the 1 MB was WAY bigger than the blocks at the time, and Satoshi proposed at the time that the limit could be raised in the future at a certain block height chosen in advance, before blocks ever started to get that big.

â¢ some time later Satoshi left the project, when he did he turned to code base over to another developer, Gavin Andreson. Several other key Bitcoin related things were also distributed to other prominent members of the Bitcoin community including the moderator of this subreddit.

â¢ No one is actually sure who Satoshi is, or what happened to him, he has not been heard from in years.  We don't know if he's changed his mind on how to allow scalability since then.

â¢ Gavin invited other prominent Bitcoin developers to be part of a team leading development on the original Bitcoin implementation, which  is now called ""Bitcoin Core"".

â¢ For almost the entire history of Bitcoin, blocks have been well under the 1 MB limit, and were unaffected by it. 

â¢ When block sizes started to approach the limit debate began on how and when to raise it.

â¢ Gavin created, wrote the code for, and throughly tested one of the first proposals for increasing the blocksize.  Gavin's proposal is designed to keep the limit well above the actual block size needed for all transactions in all but the most optimistic scenarios for Bitcoin adoption.

â¢ One of the other developers, Greg Maxwell, stated a firm position that the blocksize limit should not be raised now and that other approaches to increasing the transaction rate should be adopted instead.

â¢ There have been several additional ""compromise"" proposals that fall somewhere in between Greg's ""don't raise the limit at all"" proposal, and Gavin's ""keep the limit so big that Bitcoin continues to be unaffected by it"" proposal.  Many of which are acceptable to the majority of the community.  However Greg in particular has held firm in his belief that none of proposals that involve even a conservative increase in the limit should be adopted. 

â¢ Due to the fact that not all of the developers of core have agreed to increase the limit at this time, none of the proposals increasing the blocksize were merged.

â¢ Greg put forth a roadmap for the next year or so of development on Bitcoin core that did not include any blocksize increases but did include a proposal called ""segregated witness"" (segwit for short) that will allow an estimated 60% increase in capacity when completed and deployed. 

â¢ Generally speaking no one really objects to segwit itself, but many in the community, (I think it's actually most of the community but that will be debated) are upset that there isn't also at least a conservative increase in the blocksize limit as well. 

â¢ Within the last few months we've had times where we've seen several blocks in a row at 90+% of the limit.  And times when transactions took a longer than normal time to confirm.

Unfortunately this is about where I have to stop.  This is mostly just history, there's more to the debate, but to provide a neutral discussion you need to talk about the benefits, criticisms and motivations of each side, and this subreddit's rules don't allow for promotion of one side in particular.

I suggest repeating this question in some of the other Bitcoin subreddits for the rest of the story.So 1 guy is stopping the size increase? Why not just take a vote between all major developers attached to the project and majority wins. Tough titties to the loser. (as you can tell, I dont really care either way)Release the hounds !You won't find a dispassionate voice on this issue, because none exists.The debate is over the size of blocks, not the size of the blockchain.  

I know very little about it, but from what I gather, the core devs don't want to increase the size because they fear it will lead to further centralization of bitcoin.  I'm not sure if that refers to miners or nodes.

I think the argument for increasing block size is that as more transactions are coming through the network, they will take longer to confirm because only so many transactions can fit in each block.

Experts, please correct me where I'm wrong.  "

2016-01-12 23:23:58;"Vitalik Buterin: Those people who say ""the longest chain always wins"": what happens if there's a contentious hard fork to change the hash algo?";"""Longest chain wins"" may be an over simplification. I suspect people use that term to describe two chains on the same hash algorithm of a related coin.

The miners normally choose the longest chain as POW is an automated process that attempts to remove humans from consensus. There are exceptions, however, such as the March 2013 fork where miner majority chose to build upon the smaller 0.7 chain (as suggested by devs).

Unless the majority of SHA256 miners are also ASIC manufacturers themselves, it is difficult to imagine them willingly choosing to move to another hash algorithm. Altruism did not build bitcoin.

A fork with a new hash algorithm would likely consist of a new group of miners. The SHA256 miners would continue on the original chain initially, as they would effectively be out of business. It is unlikely the new chain would contain the same amount of expended energy and R&D of the original chain. Would the new chain be more susceptible to attack? The market would need to decide.You would create something useless as a currency, like ethereum.ALL hard forks are *contentious*, as they should be; so, please stop using that word to describe just this one, specifically. It is essentially meaningless in this context.It's not nessisarily the longest chain, it's the chain with the most work. If there was a fork that used a new hashing algorithm, the current mining would definitely stay on the old network, so not sure what it means to say who 'wins' since there will without a doubt be two chains. It really depends how much people desire the coins from each chain. I suppose the winner is the more in demand chain.Great question. I imagine both chains could coexist. Economic services would need to choose one, though. Well one would think sha-256 will be replaced once quantum computers are commercializedThose people are idiots because it's ""The longest VALID chain always wins."" Where longest is defined as having the most total work behind it.

And by definition a hard fork changes the definition of ""valid"".

- 1 millibitcoin = 1 kilobit

I guess because kilobit is already a thing. For example network speed kilobit/megabit/gigabit.First, the names of currency units other than ""bitcoin"" and ""satoshi"" don't make much sense and were developed in a very ad hoc way.

""Milibit"" is one thousandth of a bitcoin (short for millibitcoin,similar to millimeter). This unit predates the ""bit"" unit, which is one hundred satoshis.

The idea of a unit representing one hundred satoshis is sound, bit the name (bit) conflicts in a most confusing way with the pre-existing unit millibit. That's why I use ""bitcoin"" and ""satoshi"" whenever possible.Using bits enrages people enough.You don't say ""kilodollars"" do you?"

I think it's interesting that when bitcoin jumps in price, transactions go up. That is counter intuitive to the monetary inflationists out there (cough keynesians). This phenomenon shows that when bitcoin goes up, people feel wealthier, because they can actually use bitcoin, so they spend it. With ether, you cant spend it anywhere and no one actually uses it, it's pure speculation, so the txn number goes down with price spikes as people hold.

As you can see, the largest portion of the transaction data is the input signature data. Our current average transaction size is about 600 bytes or so.

The second image is the same graph, but with the 25% discounted rate for signature data found in the input scripts.

As you can see we effectively shrink every transaction by nearly half size.

And it should be noted, in the beginning, there were Libertarians against Bitcoin, some even calling it a scam, most of them saying Gold is safer, and some interpreting Menger-Mises Regression Theorem as saying Bitcoin was unsafe as not having intrinsic value.

The thing is, if a Libertarian would design a currency it would be like Bitcoin. **Bitcoin isn't just apolitical by accident, it is intentionally apolitical**, that is, it is by design, meant to prevent the centralization of power/control, which is what Libertarians want.

2016-03-08 22:06:03;Quick question about merchants & opt-in RBF;"Casual tests show ~100% success rates with concurrent transmission double spends and no opt-in RBF.  So if you are deciding to accept at 0conf or not based on RBF you are making an error.

Most existing wallets are not remotely safe for 0conf at all-- many won't even tell the user after a conflicting transaction has been _confirmed_ much less created and sent to them. You should only accept unconfirmed transactions on these wallets if something external to Bitcoin is providing for your security. (and, in general SPV wallets should probably not be showing unconfirmed transactions at all-- since they can't even tell if the coins they're being paid ever existed in the first place.)The **wallet of the client** should...

- either only support non-RBF tx

- or should support Full-RBF as well (non-default), with the possibility to double-sÃ¼end an own FUll-RBF tx by a higher-fee ""Non-RBF"" TX (to avoid a dead-lock in case merchant does not accept RBF 0-conf)

The **wallet of the merchant** should...

- display an incoming 0-conf tx and should show if it is RBF or not, to allow the merchant to reject Full-RBF 0-conf payments altogether.

- If an incoming 0-conf is non-RBF, it should show the likelihood of block inclusion into the next block (based on mem-pool and tx fee).

- Also, It should show and warn when double-spends have been detected on non-RBF transactions (possible by Bitcoin network observation ""probes"").> Should all wallets be required to have simple RBF on/off controls and very clear alerts, even SPV wallets, in the future? I think yes, unless we scrap RBF completely.

The main use case for RBF is if fees are too high and your transaction might get stuck. But right now that's not a big problem, even with very dedicated spamming the fees never rose above $0.07-08 which is pretty affordable. So in my view there is no reason for an on/off control, at this time.

As far as receiving funds go, users should be reminded that no unconfirmed transaction is safe, for any important amount of money from an untrusted source you should always wait for confirmations.

I don't think SPV wallets should be used at all at the moment to receive from untrusted sources, even with confirmations. The lack of verification makes it unsafe. I imagine all wallets are working on displaying RBF transactions, it is not a hard thing to do and is valuable for the user.


It is important to note though, 0-conf transactions are not safe even without the RBF flag so if you are going to accept 0-conf you need to factor in fraud to your margins.

* the translation files are now available on Transifex, anyone that wants to contribute to translations can do so there
* the chat conversation list now only renders the first 12 conversations when the client starts to reduce get_image calls. The rest are rendered as they are scrolled through.
* chat conversations load 20 messages at a time
* notifications load the first 6 notifications when the client starts, and loads the rest as they are scrolled through. This reduces the number of get_image calls significantly.
* moderators you have blocked are no longer shown in moderator selection views
* the settings view doesn't load moderators until the Store tab is clicked
* the settings view doesn't load blocked user data until the Blocked tab is clicked
* full screen shortcut changed to F11 on non-Mac platforms
* a loading state was added to some buttons
* moderator fees are shown in moderator listings
* the kill process on Windows was improved, which should fix a bug when closing the client on Windows machines

2. If you already donate to charity, use your coins instead. You'll be able to deduct the full value and the charity can have the long-term benefit.

3. If you have other capital losses not yet realized, do it in the same tax year so you can offset your gains.

And to make matters worse, spammers have figured out how to outsource it so they don't pay the costs themselves.I was wondering the same question. Actually it makes sense, since the approach (bitcoins is transferable hash-power aka portable hash cash) is out of balance, because hash power is magnitudes cheaper on ASICs than on CPUs. That would actually be quite smart if sending a transaction would also require some sort of brief ASIC resistant computation - something a smart phone/tablet or laptop can do.

2016-04-12 23:31:21;Given Bretton Woods: Wouldn't the US be against BTC and all other countries for it (leveling the playing field against the USD)?;"Sort of. 

Bretton Woods was the name of a far reaching international monetary standard developed in the 1940s. It was an attempt to ameliorate the monetary aspects of war.  It was supposed to essentially put all participants on a gold standard. The US dollar was to be redeemable for gold because the US owned majority of the world's gold essentially because it won the wars while all other combatants went bankrupt. I am using the term US, when more accurately it is the symbiotic beast of US banks and US government here. All other participants were to fix their each currency's price to USD. An Austrian economist's big dream. It failed. However the US economy is basically in the twilight years of the boom that was created. 

So there is no such agreement in place today.  There is a dominance in world money by the USD and a few other preferred bankcoins. The BIS coordinates central bank policy globally. The dominance is self-reinforced via military imposed trade networks that use USD for settlment, creating a military sponsored valuation increase to the USD.  

Does Bitcoin affect this?  Does it ever! Not in any real meaningful way in large scale of course. However for now, we have proven that the heavy (bloody actually) self privilege, self enrichment, and self empowering that the conglomerates in charge of currency issuance hold, is unnecessary.  

This is a revolution of the highest order!  Far from achieved but as inevitable as the Internet. Patrick Byrne calls it the extinction event for the current form of finance. Ed McAfee says its out of the bag and can't be put back in. The guy who sits in the presidents office is pleading with us to let him look at our encryption. 

Bitcoin literally has the possibility to end monetary hierarchy once and for all. Monetary hierarchy is the last and possibly greatest pillar of hierarchy existent. 

Does the US  bankstate conglomerate comply to this?  Heck no. But no nation bank state can coexist with Bitcoin. When I refer to Bitcoin, I refer to Bitcoin or whatever supplants it that will have the attributes of known supply, large capacity, adhoc crypto graphically tradable.  I think it will be Bitcoin but clearly it's not the only possibility.Yeah they're not bright"

2016-04-26 22:50:07;Lightning Network Wallets;"You can check 21.co for their implementation of payment channels.. its  a stop gap I believe until a bunch of other soft forks are integrated by miners into the network.LN does not exist yet, so no, there is no wallet yet.

Most likely it will be a feature added on to existing bitcoin wallet apps.Ln isn't ready yet 

To use it, you'll make a transaction like you do today- but instead of broadcasting to every peer on the Bitcoin network you will upload it only to select peers on the Lightning network. 

All of this will be hidden behind the implementation, so a normal user won't really see that the broadcast to everyone has become a upload to select nodes

That's for sending funds. Receiving funds is a bit trickier. You will still give out your address the same way, but there is a new component where if someone sends you a transaction, you are responsible for holding on to it: there is no shared Blockchain database to carry that duty.  I think it's possible someone will make a separate p2p or cloud database to provide that service, but that's just guessing. So you'll need to make sure you can store your wallet file safely

2016-05-03 23:44:48;EVERYTHING makes sense if David Kleiman was Satoshi Nakamoto. Hereâs why;"Good post, but seeing a look at his [publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Kleiman), it seems highly unlikely he knew good enough cryptography/maths to design bitcoinIMHO, only two people are likely candidates to be Satoshi - Nick Szabo and Hal Finney.> It is entirely possible that Wright was a trusted friend and confidante of Kleimanâs, and this might have given him access to information that âonly Satoshi could have knownâ that would have been useful when Craig Wright convinced Gavin Andresen of his legitimacy.

Gavin claimed that what convinved him beyond doubt was that Wright signed a message using the same private keys that were used to sign block 1 and block 9. Either Wright has access to the private keys and then he can prove it publicly, or he doesn't and then whatever Gavin supposedly saw was staged.

There is no need to drag David Kleiman in that story.

As this has been said countless times it is as simple as ""Sign identification message with the private keys associated with block 1 or 9 that you already claimed you control or GTFO"". In the meantime let's move on with something more interesting than this attention seeking clown.Everything makes far more sense if Wright is just making everything up.> Sadly, this is the real world, and I canât help but feel sadness for the family of David Kleiman who are possibly about to encounter tremendous invasions of their privacy as a consequence of Craig Wrightâs actions.

Oh right and this blog post wouldn't be guilty of that at all!Great piece, you really sifted through a lot of the noise over the past couple of days. Thanks OP!

It seems that the hammer is swinging one way, and that is against Wright. Not saying he isn't dragging out the proof, or misleading or things like that, but it could very likely be something like the following...

Wright is going to leave holes in his story to maintain provable doubt that he is not Satoshi. For whatever reason, this is very possible. I feel like the moving of the coins is more difficult and that's why it'll take time. Moving the coins may require a ton of legal work because of the trust that was established and things of that nature. Why did he do a bogus (and very publicly critique-able) method of proof is beyond me...

Even if Satoshi coins move, this still won't prove he is Satoshi or was Satoshi, this only shows that he's in control of Satoshi's coins. I definitely think that he has the pedigree (along with his network such as David Kleiman) to be a contributor and early person on the team who are the creators. It would seem very naive to think that a person with his pedigree (It's a legit background from what I understand?) and his close ties with David Kleiman, and the amount of smoke surrounding the topic and his name, that he's certainly associated with early developments.

I think the value is closer to $15M on the date of the trust (you cited $30M, just an fyi)

Thanks for the post, it's probably the most interesting piece I've read since this all started! Dead on. I have been thinking this for a while as well. 

Kleiman probably was in close contact with Wright and Wright may have mines some early bitcoins with him, so moving a few early coins doesn't prove squat.   The Genesis block or a signature based on satoshi's long used private key for emails would prove it, but Wright is not Satoshi. It was kleiman. 

>What does not make any sense, if Wright is Satoshi, is for him to create a trust to prevent himself being able to access his own Bitcoins until 2020 â and leave this in the trust of a man in Florida.

>Such a trust is detailed in the December 2015 leak and includes bizarre stipulations including that if Wright dies, all the Bitcoins would transfer to his wife, minus a deduction to show the âlies and fraud perpetrated by Adam Westwood of the Australian Tax Office against Dr Wrightâ. It would be interesting to know when the Australian Tax Office began their investigation. The trust is dated 9th June 2011, and values 1.1 million Bitcoins at $100,000 at a time when their actual value was closer to $30 million. The document is just odd and full of inconsistencies.

> **What seems more likely is that Kleiman possessed the Bitcoins, and Wright is trying to create a retrospective paper trail to enable him to make a legal claim for ownership of them** in the event they ever become accessible.I think this actually makes a lot of sense.
Kleiman seems to have been part of the satoshi group, but I don't think he was actually responsible for creating any bitcoin code. Rather, there is at least one more person at play who has not yet been uncovered, but this person was responsible for actually implementing the ideas brought forth by Kleiman and Wright (possibly Shyaam Sundhar, but I am just guessing as they have worked together before and Sundhar fits the cryptographist profile).
I wouldn't directly dismiss the idea that Wright was part of the group, like so many people do, because he doesn't present the same expertise that Satoshi had. Maybe the ""leaked"" email in which Wright wrote to Kleiman that he is working on a Bitcoin/bit cash project is real. But I don't think that Wright had all the pieces together yet. It is much more likely that Kleiman etc were responsible for the idea of a distributed ledger (the block chain). Maybe Wright just operated machinery for initial mining.
The leaked Tulip trust contract states that if Kleiman dies, Wright may move shares at his own discretion 15 months later. This seems to coincide with the time that the investigation of Wright by the Australian tax office started (or at least got serious). That would make a lot of sense, seeing as the contract states that the return of the coins will be in the form of a company in the Seychelles...
The entire dilemma with Wright being so dodgy (and possibly leaking these documents himself) might just have to do with another NDA in place by Kleiman to Wright, or a mutual NDA between all members of the satoshi group.Kleiman was a man struggling to pay his mortgage who died in squalor. This does not fit the description of a man who had in sole possession $500m worth of Bitcoin.This sounds like an equally wild goose-chase. 

Plus, I don't think David Kleiman was a c++ programmer from what I've read about him. It's also convenient that he's no longer alive.I'm newbie for bitcoin, I'm very doubt that Why so many people claim there are Satoshi Nakamoto. Whoever he is he just build a great innovation.Why we care so much about himOr, Wright is in possession of some of the 'satoshi' coins (we assume satoshi mined all those coins but we don't know that) because Wright threw a lot of coordinated hash power at the network from early days, he claims to be in possession of some big iron. However it does not mean he is actually satoshi the architect who wrote the paper, satoshi the hacker genius who coded the first implementation and satoshi who generated the genesis block.

Wright should be very careful what he claims he did and didn't do.Just a question. Didn't the real satoshi comment on Dorian or what was that about? 4 month ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3w3ije/interesting_facts_about_david_kleimans_life/One point you missed : Satoshi intervention's time have been mapped. His most likely location is in eastern America.Incidentally, https://redd.it/4hu5qw mentions that the name Satoshi comes from Satoshi David character in the House of MorganWhat if Wright created Bitcoin but Kleiman was the one who did the mineing (not sure if this was stated already here, didnt read all comments). That would explain Wright claiming to be Satoshi but not having access to the 1M BTC to prove anything.  I'm starting to really hate this sub.I don't believe that, but I do believe junseths mother doesn't love him. Bitcoin Drama is getting hot. 
BBC should now organise a grand Bitcoin and Blockchain Summit and invite  all the ex candidates and the current Satoshi candidate Dr. Craig Wright. All the Bitcoin and Blockchain community leaders will be there in the Summit. The BBC must hire independent forensic exparts to very the every elements to identify the real Satoshi Nakamoto. I will request His Divine Holiness Satoshi Nakamoto to attend the Summit to end all the conspiracy theories and speculation regarding Bitcoin invention and about Him. He will definitely attend the Summit and unmask himself and reward accreditations to all the hackers and Bitcoin and Blockchain developers those have assisted His Divine Holiness Satoshi Nakamoto by engaging themselves this revolutionary Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and Satoshi is a world class epic drama. I have spent 2 years to find the real Satoshi Nakamoto who is victim. Bitcoin Project was hijacked from His Honesty Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin community leaders should rethink what they have done to hijack the Bitcoin Project from a visionary scientist. They must confess their wrong doing. HH Satoshi Nakamoto is humble man of principle. He has suffered very gravely and still continuously suffering while greedy hackers and Cypherpunks have become millionaires out of his Bitcoin Project. I am Roselyn Hamilton requesting to Gavin Andresen and all other Bitcoin community leaders to think humanely what they are doing? There is a limit for wrong doing. You should have not done this thing to a scientist. HH Satoshi Nakamoto  will forgive you all if you seek his pardone.

None of you can handle that SN is not some crypto guru and not American so you look to somehow come up with some convoluted story to make SN American to makes yourselves feel better. Sometimes the truth hurts. No. Remember when Dorian was framed as Satoshi. The man himself made a post on a forum saying ""I'm not Dorian Nakamoto"" which probably after Kleiman death. Then recently Garvin y Mike teaming up to fork, he sent a letter sounding like him declaring Bitcoin was a failed experiment should the fork succeeded, although there's a slim chance those accounts were hacked."

But, if Gavin sat there with him reminiscing with CSW, and CSW spoke about private e-mails and conversations between the two of them.. Wouldn't that be convincing? It was also mentioned that he saw old drafts of the whitepaper, etc.

My point is- Nobody has any clue what was said in the meeting. Seems like instead of shitting all over Gavin, people should sit back and wait for the nutjob (that may very well be Satoshi) to publish something. Craig Wright made him sign an NDA, he now owns gavin and if Gavin if says anything he will be sued in court.

Gavin fucked up...So he still believes CW is Nakamoto. Bizarre.Cognitive dissonance is a powerful mechanism. Gaving seems fully submerged. Gavin is lying.  Nothing is hard to explain when you accept that premise.  Fake Satoshi would be helpful to Gavin, so he got in on a hoax (you know, greater-good bullshit that liars often convince themselves of).

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=322328.msg3463519#msg3463519

This guy open sourced the bitcoinia source code with a MtGox api key in it allowing the rest of bitcoinia's funds to be stolen. Developers didnt trust someone who makes that big of a mistake and removed him from the security mailing list. He got pissy and bashes gavin and mike any chance he gets.So he's aliveIm a little confused by what is going on in this post. Its written like its mysticism. There's all these vague accusations with little substance. Where is all this malicious behavior that Gavin has exhibited? 

I've seen a enormous amount of trolling and character attacks without any rational explanation. And all those bitcointalk threads. Wow, it writes like a conspiracy theorist deep into speculation.

How is Amir doing? Didn't hear any news about him for long time.Re Shrem I found it really off-putting how Hearn right away made a statement criticising Shrem and saying how its totally different then HSBC getting away with their money laundering.

Defending Banks and criticizing one of their own without even knowing the facts.

As it turned out after facts came out it seemed that the case against Shrem was very shoddy and seemed like a regulator trying to gain publicity possibly for a political career.

The pro-regulation people, and that includes Gavin, ditched Shrem like he was poison, and he was one of them before.  

Mike Hearn
>Shrem is accused of something entirely different - not just doing an insufficient amount of work, but knowingly co-operating with someone he knew was a Silk Road dealer explicitly to help him launder money. It's the ""knowingly"" part that makes the huge difference.
The US DoJ did not seem to have large piles of emails from the head of compliance at HSBC showing him buying drugs and helping known dealers to evade his own controls. With BitInstant they do.
It's really no wonder Bitcoin businesses can't get bank accounts, when guys like Shrem were putting on a respectable face and doing that kind of thing behind the scenes. Silk Road and those involved with it are by far the most damaging thing that could ever have happened to Bitcoin, especially so early on.

The comment was made a day after Shrems arrest. There were other similar comments by Mike.

As it turned out all Shrem done was email some guy where he can buy weed online. HSBC installed special deposit holes for drug cartels to drop in suitcases of money, but supposedly HSBC 'knows nuffin!'.> RE: bitcoin-security mailing list:  bottom line is I don't trust you. I think you have made irresponsible decisions in the past, and I don't trust that you would handle sensitive security issues responsibly. 

Gavin was right not to trust Amir on Security Issues. Amir made a royal mess of Bitcoinica security for example. Purposefully leaking source code leading to further breaches costing its customers millions in damages and lost coins. 

Amir is right on fiercely resisting corruption and statism imho. Gavins 'star patch' quote is genuinely worrying and says a lot about his character. Gavin is too eager to please the wrong people. That said Gavin did contribute a lot to Bitcoin and that should be recognized. Good to hear that Amir is alive, wondering what he has been cooking up ...Amir would experience less mainstream rejection if he used a less aggressive language.

If you have the right arguments, you don't need aggressive language. On the contrary, such languages does you a disservice.Amir Taaki's Bitcoin is the one I am excited about- the whole please everybody and follow ""authority"" is really tired and will lead to nothing new-Glad Amir Taaki reappeared.By the way, found Shrem in the Panama Papers leaks, along with Voorhees:

**Erik Voorhees** - https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/12224872

It's more than obvious Gavin is following a fish line with a bag of money as bait. It's time for the community to see this so that we can start disregarding his actions and move on with the bitcoin experiment.Screw MIT permission coin!This is refreshing. Not blatantly hostile, not full of ad hominem attacks, just an honest personal assessment of the situation. Glad to hear from Amir. Of the two... Only one has been publicly involved in two exchange failures.

The other... Publicly... Seems very rational and calm, and has never indulged in this sort of ad hominem attack.Its time for Gavin to go the way of Mike.  How people can stand behind him after he embarrassed himself and the community TWICE in one 3 month span is beyond me.What a great post by Amir. I definitely resonate with his call to action.

2016-05-17 23:43:41;Segwit versus Deterministic Signatures;"Apples and oranges.

Segwit is trying to solve malleability, and ECDSA signatures are only one source of malleability.

As long as there are parts of the transaction not hashed for signing, but hashed for txid, there will always be malleability.

Removing the ScriptSig from the txid hash is the only solution.Even if you could enforce deterministic signatures (you can't because you need the private key to confirm that it follows rfc6979), you're neglecting the numerous other places where malleability exists within a transaction. I think what you really care about is ""Strict DER encoding"" when it comes to signature malleability anyway. To get an idea of how malleability *was* going to be fixed before Segwit softfork read this: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki

Edit: I wonder if there's a way to supply a zero-knowledge proof that you used a deterministic signature. Pretty sure it would be purely academic, though.Given two different signatures from the same public key, signing the same message, it's not possible to determine which used RFC6979 without access to the private key.

You can determine that at most 1 of them did.  Maybe neither.  Can't be both, because they're different.  RFC6979 is a good idea but nobody can tell if you're using it.ECDSA has an inherent malleability (+/- s), RFC6979 can't fix that. Segwit's scope w.r.t. malleability fixing is broader than just the ECDSA signatures though, anyway.

Although from your question I wonder if you're aware that RFC6979 is being used in Bitcoin Core and most wallets now.Thanks everyone for the most enlightening and helpful responses.There are other ways besides signatures to malleate a transaction.

You are however correct about wondering about segwit.  Since segwit full nodes still have to store the witness data, they aren't saving any space.  It's a lot of complicated code in order to avoid a hard fork, and instead forking letting old nodes know they need to upgrade, it leaves old nodes thinking they are validating things when in fact they are not.  There's no space saved and it hurts non-upgraded nodes."

2016-05-17 22:37:18;Bitcoin Difficulty Issue;"A minor point.  The halving does not occur at the same time as a difficulty change.  It will occur one third of the way through a difficulty change as 420000/2016 = 208.333.

So after the halving there are 1344 blocks, or about 10 days to the next difficulty change, not 2016 blocks.

Agree with the other comments that halving will not result to a major turn off of machines. 

65% of the hashing network is under 6 months old. The hashing network has tripled in size in the last 6 months.  Most of these will be 16/14nm miners. Those machines will still be profitable after the halving.  

The only 28nm miner with any chance of being profitable after the halving is the S7, and then only in really low electricity cost areas.

   It's a block reward halving, so worse case scenario 50% of miners shut down, new difficulty in 4 weeks. Note when the BTC/USD price dropsnin half, the hashrate maybe drops 1%The biggest problem with the change you propose is that it is a hard fork. Anyone who doesn't hear about the change or anyone who chooses not to update their node software will be working on a different chain than the people who did upgrade.

Having said that, I've seen talk on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about using a hard fork if the hashrate does drop massively after the halving.You are wrong.  This will result in a less stable block generation time."

2016-05-24 23:10:17;"Nick Tomaino on Twitter: ""Important to remember: bitcoin has infinite patience and no burn rate. Take individual perspectives with a big grain of salt.""";"Bitcoins selling point was never network effect. The selling point was its fundamental properties. Those are still intact, which is why it has infinite patience. The network effect is a bonus. People who are leaving bitcoin, probably didnt care about the fundamentals anyway. But there are still people who do, and those were arguably the ones that got us so far, so why should it stop now? to the moon!Yup, Coinbase is feeling the squeeze because Bitcoin isn't generating the volume they anticipated. Infinite patience, finite supply, fantastic utility.If I were an investor in Coinbase, I'd be a little bit worried right about now. Perhaps Fred and Brian are too easily distracted by shiny things, or maybe they're just really pissed off that they couldn't influence the core development process by making uneducated blog posts, and this is their sour grapes retaliation. The word ""pivoting"" also comes to mind, which is usually the end stage of a failing startup.

The fact is that Ethereum isn't a true cryptocurrency - it's a centrally controlled and highly experimental platform for running equally highly-experimental contracts that will likely prove to have limited utility due to the difficulty of writing useful and secure contracts. It doesn't even make a good form of money - ETH units release like crazy and will do so indefinitely. 

Maybe it will prove to be the bestest crypto system out there one day, but it's way too early for someone to make the kind of absurd and overconfident post that Fred made.

Bitcoin's full capabilities haven't even been fully explored or exploited yet. It's really irresponsible for Coinbase management to waste their investment capital on something even more risky than Bitcoin when there's still so much to do to secure Bitcoin's longevity and to open up its potential.

It's too bad that Coinbase didn't try harder to work within the distributed development consensus model. That have no right to bitch about a of a lack of leadership in Bitcoin development when they offered no resources of their own to the effort.
Miner profits (i.e. Bitcoin security) can burn away.Bitcoin may have infinite patience, but the market doesn't.Coinbase has a limited shelf life-- they are participating in the distribution stage of Bitcoin, but what then for them? Better pump something which is _always_ in distribution phase. Does ""infinite patience"" refer to resting on our laurels and assuming that our Network Effect alone is going to keep Bitcoin relevant?  Because Id say that's a risky viewpoint to take. One could argue that hashing power is bitcoin's burn rate, but it's dynamically adaptable to demand.The people burning money are also the ones providing utility and marketing. that brings in the, like, real people to use stuff. I'm sure techno weenies will continue to love bitcoin when everyone else has been lured elsewhere.LOL no burn rate, true if you're a guy running mining rigs in a cave in China who gets free electricity because he bribed the local Party official.

Merge #8164: [Bitcoin-Tx] fix missing test fixtures, fix 32bit atoi iâ¦ Sounds like you know absolutely nothing about what is going on and all the good work core are doing.  Making changes to a 10 billion dollar currency is not like painting a house. It's done with care and planning and takes time to get right. I for one hope that core take their time to ensure every last thing is checked before releasing any change. If you prefer a fast changing, untested alternative the there are many out there.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4kmum6/i_keep_reading_people_say_bitcoin_development_is/https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/

Miners make more money with full blocks.  Look at the charts below.

http://imgur.com/a/6B0AN

As transactions fill up the mem-pool, folks over estimate the fees, because they're in a hurry.     The fees more than double for the miners when a little backlog occurs... so I doubt miners care about big blocks at this stage.  

IMO, Core is not crippling bitcoin... they're giving it super powers.   

CSV + SegWit, allows for many off chain solutions to develop.  Once those feature are in place, and LN boots up, we should see real trustless micropayments emerge.  Imagine tipping fractions of a penny, just like the dogecoin days, without having to worry about confirmations, or deal with 3rd parties like Changetip.  

Sure the development process takes time, but this software is complex and there's a lot of different features in flight at the same time.    

Just chill out and sit tight.




> they aren't hurting

But you are...and that's what happens when you hurry -- you make mistakes.Releasing Segwit is in their interest.

1. They would prove they are scaling Bitcoin and shut up people like you.
2. They will solve the malleability problem -another feather in the cap
3. Version bits will help them as much as it helps everyone.

you know nothingThe segwit was published a couple of months ago and they are currently having a code review.  As far as I know, the step after that will be deployment.  I agree that it has taken way too long (with respect to the market sentiment), but code reviews are important for critical infrastructure.  In my opinion, what would have been more ideal is for the entire segwit process to start earlier so that the entire timeline would shift.

I don't blame them for how slow and careful they are when it comes to the process of releasing code.  I DO criticize them for not deploying *any* solution faster.  This could have been achieved by:

1. Starting development of segwit earlier and deploying it earlier.
2. Or using another scaling option (2MB hard fork or *anything* really).

Both of these are scaling options and were needed yesterday.  I don't actually care which is used and I would have supported either of them *as long as they were deployed to the network Jan 2016*.

The biggest issue I have with Core is not their solution, but their timeline.  The network is a *living entity* which means that time is critical.When reality doesn't match your logic and reasoning, you might want to check your logic and reasoning.

Two possible outcomes:

1. transaction confirmed - ownership of the money trades hands
2. transaction not confirmed and gradually deleted from the network - the money stays with its current owner

There is no way to know what will be the fate of your transaction. You can push the process by re-spending with a new transaction paying higher fees, but currently this is for advanced users only.Most good wallets have fee priority setting when sending a transaction. I always set it to high priority. It's around 8 cents instead of 4 cents. This way my transactions almost always show get confirmed in 10 mins maxDon't worry, the lightening network will be here someday to help you out.How much fee you included ?I sent two transactions in the last 24 hours, both cleared in less than 30 minutes.

Why do you special snowflakes post about your crap transactions, when it all comes down to two things --

1. Unconfirmed inputs from a previous transaction

2. Being too cheap to throw in a few fractions of a bitcoin to get your transaction processed

I mean really, pay the goddamned fee you cheap assholes.
Pay a fee if you want it included. "
2016-06-21 23:35:55;Could someone please make me feel better and explain how Bitcoin is somehow not simply a massive tax hassle with no future?;"First, check out https://bitcoin.tax

This topics comes up often, and you'll find a lot of posts about it, at least back to 2012.

Next, yes, till the IRS classifies digital currencies anything other than capital property then you are going to have this issue.

So technically, right now, you must report every transaction as it is a tax event and you need to calculate capital gains. Fortunately, in many small transactions your gains are going to be negligible and so not taxed (gains less than $0.50 are rounded to zero).
Most of us don't buy regularly. We buy and HODL.

thete plenty of time to spend bitcoin in the future -- and so little time to accumulate it...We have an app for that.

https://bitcoin.tax/Its not out job to convince you of anything .  If it's not for you then all we can say is thanks for trying it with an open mind.  

But just as thought experiment,  outside of sizeable amounts how would anyone prove a wallet was in your possession for specific transactions that created a taxable  event?  It would see to me that there would not be that capability or resources to do that. Because as we know bitcoin is fickle technology,  coins are lost and stolen all the time.  
Because Bitcoin is a hassle to use as a currency in the U.S., it has ""no future""?

> Tl;dr How do you guys deal with capital gains/losses

For ""spending wallets"", I presume most simply don't.  Especially since until the last half year, few had gains to even worry about.If Bitcoin is successful the tax law will adapt to bitcoin, not the reverse, as it should be.

If paying tax when you use bitcoin is complicated, then people will just stop paying tax more than stop using bitcoin.

Not mentioning what other said: we don't spend, we hodl.Bitcoin will change/disrupt our perception about taxes. Today we have forced taxation ([theft](http://www.activistpost.com/2016/06/irs-admitted-it-stole-millions-from-innocent-people-giving-it-back.html)), but in few years Bitcoin will change that in voluntary taxation.

Truly a profound contribution.Or its in the bull trap stage of the bubbleNope, Bitcoin is dead. Surely there has been an article proving that by now?This is likely a healthy pull back to a larger run.  It has dropped in order to fill the gap.  No way. Look at the total life span of bitcoin. It's pretty clearly in the 'Return to Mean' phase.

In fact I predicted a few years ago that this was exactly what would happen, when it happened. My friends were asking me if I should invest when I was telling them that bitcoin will return to growth in mid-16. It departed from the mean in 16... but in terms of its overall lifespan it almost fits perfectly into this graph and the beartrap phase ended a long, long time ago.

This thread is freakin hilarious. Why not bull trap?Or a bull-trap.I totally agree and actually took advantage of it (sorry I didn't stay HODL!). I looked at how the spikes always did that in 2013 and late 2016 and thought since it'd be a bigger spike, it'd happen at a higher price. I predict around a 5000 dollar high, which puts our bear trap right where it should be. Either way Hodl Any chart on any exchange compared to OP's chart would say we are in a bull trap but whatev...Either that or we're right at the end and no one knows what's going to happen nextWell, this pretty much looks like the real btc graphic: http://imgur.com/Vb0B2Op

If it wasn't for this month price grow, they are almost the same.i am rather thinking of the bull trapMore like the Bull Trap.Where are the numbers in time and valuation?que Aerosmith ""Dream on""    Bull trap It's in the Bull Trap ... any sane person would be taking their gains right now. There has been no rational reason for the recent spike.Bear trap was in November. This is the bull trap.Hope so, I wanna buy gold ASE's with just 1 bitcoin :)Imho, more like we're in denial (in the middle of the bull trap).This is just fucking stupid.  Right now a tiny number of people control things on the exchanges.  No matter how hard you try to ignore this, that is the reality.
Pro tip-these same people read these and similar posts on /r/Bitcoin/ and regularly laugh at you.Probably correct, but I'm not taking the risk.This thread is hilarious.  Great graph. Now the only thing left to do is to show this graph has anything to do with reality and where we are. LOLSeems like the *Return to the mean* phase to me. Bitcoin already had all that media attention, craze, greed, etc.One thing to consider is if Bitcoin really is the next big thing and gets to $200,000 in ten years, then the average annual capital gain will be 77%. So it's possible that there will be many of these huge gains that are actually sustained.Niggas talkin bubbles and bears I'm just tryin' to get my expedia paid foat only 10/11 bln market cap it's no where near the institutional investor phase.I was right (sorry) when I said its a bull trapI think the chart is nonsense. Bubbles are created by foolish or deceived (as in the case of fed printing money) buyers. 

Smart investors buy an asset because they know it is more valuable than the current market price.

Trying to predict future price changes based on historical prices alone (and maybe a chart such as this) will not give you better results than random purchases.bitcoin goign to $20In the larger scheme of things, chart analysis of Bitcoin will tell you nothing. 
Bitcoin still has an 'unknown' factor that cannot be accounted for in technical analysis. Why bother with Bitcoin? It lost 90% of its value relative to Ethereum in the past 6 months, thanks to the bearded crazies who took over the project. Time to move on.I think people in China saw how awful and cruel the Bitcoin community was to the Eth community and now that the Eth community is turning around, the only thing they remember of bitcoin is how shitty they were.

its' the same night as UFC 200 fights... partyI predict $1400 per coin around new years. 

but a stable hold around 850-900 after halving. 

just my predictions .. i am being optimistic. moon!Bought at $330 in preparation for the halving.

Already doubled in value, and it's not even here yet.People are going to learn what ""buy the rumour, sell the news"" means the hard wayWill be interesting to see what happens. My bet - people are going to panic sell and bring the price down. I predict USD$100 at its low point. Who knows how long it will take to recover, but it will. And probably to the moon!

Reasons:

* mining capacity will drop, transactions take longer because difficulty won't adjust for a while - people panic sell.

* people freak out thinking the system will never recover and that the time it takes for difficulty to adjust will be ""an eternity"", panic selling.

* people remember bitcoin is an ""experiment"", and panic sell.

* mining pool drops and centralises with a few major miners, people see risk of 51% attack increasing - and panic sell

* exchanges get smashed with traffic and probably go offline, people panic sell when they successfully manage to submit a transaction.

It'll recover of course, and then the price will rise again!

HODL :)I like it.I love that rocket. Where is fuel truck, seen it beofre refuelling rocket. 
Great brilliant idea.  LOLWhen is the next drop after this one? Are they going to update the graphic so it has like smoke coming out as the days get closer??? That would be awesome.Excuse my ignorance, but wouldn't it make more sense to double the reward of finding a new block as time goes on (as each block is harder to discover), as opposed to halving it?Some artist should make a ""The Happening/The Halvening"" poster with popular bitcoin personalities replacing the Wahlberg et alIt's sell the news atmPredictions anyone?"

But there is no reason you need to if you don't want to. 
If you are only playing around with a few dollars I would not waste the fee money sending it.
The import is fine.Sweep/send the funds to one of the addresses that Electrum generates for you. Your imported address is not withing the HD structure of the addresses in your pre-existing wallet, which means it won't be recovered via the 12-word passphrase in the circumstance that you have to ""recover"" this wallet.A default Electrum seed is not compatible with a mycelium seed, Electrum has a slightly different seed format. Also it is not the best idea to share a seed on multiple devices imho, you then have multiple points where someone could steal the seed. 

*(But there is a way around this if you really want, when you create a new wallet with Electrum: select ""restore a wallet"", at the bottom select ""hardware wallet"", then select ""Keepkey"" or ""Trezor"", and select ""Restore Electrum wallet from device seed words"", enter mycelium seed, leave passphrase empty - that should work)*

Best is still to create a normal electrum wallet, write down the seed - then send the bitcoins in a normal transaction from mycelium to electrum."

If you generate a new wallet using Bitcoin Core that you don't use for anything else, and someone sends you bitcoin to that wallet, your are 'anonymous' so far.  But how are you paying for the bitcoin?  If you are buying it with a credit card or a bank account, then the company you bought it from knows your name and can trace those coins.  If you are buying it with cash in person, then the other person sees your face, and likely has your phone number or email address that they used to arrange the meetup.

If you ever send the bitcoin to an exchange, you will need to use your identity to open the exchange account.  If you spend the bitcoin to buy something online, you will have to use a physical address to have the item shipped to you.  The merchant and/or bitcoin payment processor could potentially de-anonymize you.  If you sell the bitcoin for cash in person, the other person will see your face and probably have your phone number or email address used to arrange the meetup.

If you ever use that same bitcoin wallet to make other transactions that are traceable to you, you will de-anonymize yourself by associating your anonymous address with your non-anonymous addresses on the blockchain.  When you send the bitcoins, you could be de-anonymized by companies who try to connect to every bitcoin node to see the IP address from which transactions originate.  Tor may help you with this last point by hiding your IP, but Tor does not obfuscate your bitcoin addresses on the blockchain.
You don't. Bitcoin is never anonymous, and anyone telling you it is doesn't know what they're talking about.How about making a paper wallet: 

Bitcoin 101 - Intro to Paper Wallets & Cold Storage - Bitcoin Security & Fun with Sloppy Wallets 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1uefzJJ6nMIf you really need 100% reliable anonymity, as in ""they will kill me if they find me"", that's actually very hard to achieve... You'd also need to be very careful about what address in what wallet you receive the coins on, and where and how you transfer it further. If you're not, at some point later the transaction can be matched to you through some other coins you mix in from another address, or through an exchange account, etc.
There is no such thing as a Bitcoin account. You don't open account, and there is no central server that keeps track of ip addresses of wallets. 

To have better anonymity, you should never reuse addresses, use coin control when sending Bitcoin, and connect to the network through Tor.> ÐÐ¾w dÐ¾ Ð mÐ°kÐµ Ð° ÑÐ¾mÑlÐµtÐµlÑ Ð°nÐ¾nÑmÐ¾us bÑtÑÐ¾Ñn Ð°ÑÑÐ¾unt?

There are no accounts. There are addresses. All Bitcoin addresses you create are anonymous until you leak information tying them to you.

So you make a new address. Nobody in the world knows the address except you, and so the address is ""completely anonymous"".

Then you need payment from someone. You tell him your address. Now he knows that address belongs to you. If he also knows your IP address then he can tie the address to your IP address. And so on.

Later, when you spend from that address, everyone can see that the coins you are spending came from the guy who sent them to you.

But Bitcoin itself doesn't track IP addresses, certainly not of the machine that created the address.

It is probably worth reading up more about how Bitcoin works, given how you seem stuck on the idea of ""opening an account"" with Bitcoin...First rule of Bitcoin address, **""You! do not talk about Bitcoin address.""**TAILS comes preinstalled with a Bitcoin wallet which you can generate offlineTo preserve privacy of your IP address: use TAILS, TOR, and/or VPN.

To preserve privacy of your bitcoin transactions on the blockchain:

1. Receive bitcoin to a new account you control.
2. Exchange bitcoin for monero.
3. Exchange monero for bitcoin, preferably somewhere else or at a later date to avoid receiving back the same bitcoin you originally exchanged.www.torproject.org

If you have a VPN, I would use both at the same time.  You can connect to your VPN first, then open TOR and create an anonymous wallet somewhere.  That should suffice... hopefully your VPN doesn't keep logs.Bitcoin is not anonymous, http://www.bitcoinisnotanonymous.com/, and its rather impossible these days to achieve 100% certainty that your btc transactions wont be tracked to you, or someone you sent your bitcoins, etc."

Is still possible that a person inside BitGo had access to the key?My investigation has found no purpose to using the BitGo servers.

Seriously though, can someone explain the point if they just automatically sign (with their second/third key) anything that that first key owner tells them to?If you supply a system to a customer and allow them to misuse it to the tune of $80 million loss, you share the blame no matter the technicals.

I'm betting 1 bitfinex hot key + 1 bit go key.  bitgo had no flags to prevent a 100 million clean out and stop signing.  bitfinex hates their customers so lured them all in with the word multi signature which gave them no benefit security-wise or functionality wise compared to a central standard wallet.https://www.bitgo.com/jobs

No they will not shut down. Lent USD/BTC Swaps are GROWING by 100k-200k dollars every single day. Bitfinex recently stated that they have around 7 Million dollars worth of funds still left.

They also stated that they did not take a 36% haircut of their funds.

So Bitfinex , were any of those funds in bitcoins that were hacked? You did not take a 36% cut from your 7 million dollars, instead you simply took funds from customers and then paid yourselves 100% of your losses...

What the actual F**K!!!?

RELEASE THE BOOKS AND HAVE A THIRD PARTY AUDIT THEM!

The delay is probably them editing/cooking their current books to cover up this massive theft. If they do so (and create fictitious ""customer trading accounts"" that ""got hacked"") they will also be able to issue themselves additional BFXtokens (current estimate is up to 7 million tokens to themselves or their ""fictitious accounts"" that they are likely creating to try cover up their theft).
lets say they had all 7 million dollars worth in bitcoins, they will have to create fake trading accounts that supposedly suffered $19,444,444.44 worth or 32192.78-BTC that were stolen in order to then take 7 million dollars worth of bitcoins from their customers.

The truth is simple and wouldnt require excuses and time hurdles in order to explain to customers why they are being robbed 36%...

However lies will take them much time and effort to create, hence the major delays regarding them releasing data related to their theft, since this kind of data could easily be used against them and if they screw up even one detail people will probably find it!

It's expensive.
No.Unless you have specialized hardware and very cheap or free electricity then it will likely not be profitable. You'd be better off just buying bitcoin outright and waiting for the price to appreciate over time.

That said, if you're still interested in pursuing this, I'd recommend doing some reading of /r/bitcoinmining, especially the sidebar info and perhaps do a search for ""bitcoin mining calculator"" to further determine if it'd work for you.Yes, you can still make bitcoin through mining.. technically.

Find an alt-coin with a low difficulty for mining that can be traded on an exchange for bitcoin. Mine that coin and turn them into bitcoin.I always wonder why newcomers always try to look into mining first, its funny, I did the same thing.

Forget about mining, for now at least anyway. 

If you want Bitcoin, buy it from an exchange or from a Bitcoin ATM (see: coinatmradar.com).

And only store your bitcoin in wallets you own the private keys too. 

Any money you would have spent on mining equipment...buy the equivalent value in bitcoin.  
Do this today.There are calculators available that take into account all the fixed and variable costs. Saying ""no its not profitable"" is a bit like saying, ""nobody goes there anymore, its too crowded.""  You can't just plug in your desktop and expect to see a return.  The only way to see any return is using ASIC miners and they are power hungry.  They generally fix the cost of the miner about what you could reasonably expect to mine in something like a 10-12 month period, and in that time global hash rates will increase as well as the difficulty level.

My comments then were that there were better ways to show evidence, such as a transaction id.  This time the [source article](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/private-sector/new-frontier-terror-fundraising-bitcoin-1089) does include some probably unique transaction details, though not with a handy link.  Author Fanusie speculates that the transaction could be an operational test rather than an actual donation.

> Still, digital currency advocates who are familiar with cryptocurrency exchanges, forums, and even darknet websites should set up watchdog groups that look for nefarious bitcoin activities. Such groups could inform blockchain companies, the media, and even law enforcement of digital malfeasance that would otherwise go ignored. Financial technologists should be proactive in flagging such digital currency transactions, in the same way that some cybersecurity specialists become âwhite hatâ hackers to report computer vulnerabilities and cyber threats.

Immediately we see another call to taint coins and destroy financial privacy, without any hint of due process or recourse.  At least Mike Hearn's conversations kept those considerations in mind, LOL.  Fanusie is apparently trying to offer Bitcoin transactions which get denied as often as credit card transactions, except there's no customer service to call.

Make sure you back it up and when it comes to selling go back to the place you bought from and sell away.   Buy and HODL You holdIt's like any asset. You can buy it in a lump sum or you can dollar cost average your way in. Decide how much money you want to invest, and then do it.

They didn't. As you can see in that blockchain explorer, the 'double spend' was confirmed. I.e. they sent the bitcoins (which they made you believe will be yours) somewhere else. This might be malicious or unintentional.

No.

Please contact them, tell them that you didn't receive the payment and that you want them to do the payment (for real this time). Consider incoming bitcoins yours if the transaction sending to your address has 2+ confirmations (this usually takes 15 to 100 minutes - providing appropriate fee is used and the transaction isn't spending unconfirmed outputs of previous transactions).
Most wallets that noobs use will not allow a double spend. It is very possible that this is an intentional con. Keep that in mind when dealing with this customer."

2016-10-18 22:58:03;What I think is the biggest flaw in blockchain technology. Do you guys agree?;"No. Bitcoin MUST be a highly-valued commodity first or it will never become money.

Only when a government decrees your currency money can you get around this historically-proven-zillions-of-times fact. The vast majority of people do not understand how traditional currencies actually work but they use them extensively.  I do however agree that the software ecosystem for Bitcoin is still comparatively immature but is rapidly developing.

The timeliness of fiat transactions is illusory, in reality most of these transactions take at least a couple days, that you can ""see"" them before hand is not much different than seeing them as unconfirmed in the mempool.Bitcoin transactions appear instantly on the network and Bitcoin settles transactions much faster than PayPal or credit cards which can issue chargebacks months later.  Not certain this article understands how Bitcoin is currently used.  Bitcoin has become a commodity that people hold hoping it will go up in value.  It does not compete with the 'touch and go' credit cards. 

Maybe this will change with Lightning and similar technologies but for the moment Bitcoin should be viewed as a commodity, like Gold,  rather than a currency.

Also this thread has ""blockchain technology"" in the title.  The article does not discuss blockchain technology.

    }When I first heard about Bitcoin it made complete sense, the ability to transport money anywhere in the world with no financial intermediary, finally technology has broken into the realm of money. As 2017 approaches, it is amazing to see how far Bitcoin has come but I would like to remind everyone that this is still a big experiment. I strongly believe the massive amount of investments built around Bitcoin right now has huge influence over its future regarding issues such as scaling. The future for Bitcoin remains cloudy...So what is you point? We have seen similar backlog at least one hundred times in the past.hello guys can anybody tell me what is goin on bitcoin transaction. I have a transaction 10 hours ago but i have 0 confirmation untill now..this is my transaction https://blockchain.info/tx/7141d2c853ee8a19d8ab5d4b62481db5d016e887ff5443649bf9d0c19b203186 Ive had no problemsSeg wit is coming. Meanwhile, pay your fees, yeh cheapskates.If you look at https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin some people are paying up to $10 to get into the next block. :OWell this explains why my transaction I started a few hours ago still has 0 confirmations

Is there somewhere I can see how many transactions are being processed per hour or something like that? Just curious how long it's gonna take (approx) to get to mine.

Nvm could have literally just googled it https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactionsIs this something we have to wait out to get what is sent to go through or is there a way to fix thisIt looks like that altcoiners will be hashing BU with their 10% slice of total bitcoin hashing power to block SegWit activation. SegWit WILL NOT activate at 15.11 and it's effectively blocked by BU and ViaBTC.

We're in situation where bitcoin scaling is totally blocked and there's no way out.See https://www.bitcoinqueue.com/

This is definitely an all time high for the mempool!ffs people, hold onto your shit. if you have to make a tx right now, be safe and use atleast .0006 fee. btc always chews through the mempool and it will do it again. this happens from time to time, it will be ok. waiting a few hours is still better than a bank transfer wait a few days.[removed]I sent a transaction today and it was confirmed pretty quickly, nothing abnormal. I don't see what the big deal is.  Why doesn't everybody just pay 20-30% more than the median fee?  Cheapskates.Oh so I'm not the only one with 4 unconfirmed transactionsNo need for bigger blocks. Hell, /u/LukeJr wants smaller blocks according to his latest post. Good luck with settlement coin kids. Can we at least all agree at this stage that the calculations of 7 transactions per second and the later revision to 3 transactions per second are both fundamentally flawed?  

Clearly bitcoin is unable to sustain 2 tx/s in its current state. Real world experience trumps chalkboard scribbling every time. So? Yesterday was similar, before yesterday as well. Not the first time, not the last time. Just pay higher fee, and you will have no problems with unconfirmed transactions.  This will clear fast. Only 15mbs of mempoolshhhh working as expectedbe right back, re-allocating my cryptocurrency holdingsI guess 100,000 is the next frontier.I've had several transactions waiting periods of 4hours to 10hours now with no confirmations. Basically my payments have just vanished. 

The responses I've had from the ""community"" seem to be either ""this is normal, stop complaining"" or ""you didn't pay enough fees"".

Well, if this is normal then it's not good enough and bitcoin is unusable. If it's a matter of fees then I paid the fees I paid before as chosen by my client.

If I went online with my bank and transferred money to someone and they didn't get it in 5 minutes I'd be thinking something was broken. If after a few hours I called them and got the response that this was normal, or I should have paid more than they asked me for at the time of sending I'd be looking for a new bank. Plus somehow they manage to do this without any fees at all!

I love bitcoin and have used it a lot, but delays of this magnitude will very rapidly kill it. Bitcoin is going up, time for another FUD post to get pumped to the front page. LOL. Keep clawing bro.Believers be like http://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.pngBitcoin died months ago makes no sense to me We all knew about the problem of network congestion years in advance. Satoshi proposed a solution years and years back. Gavin posted about the problem when we were only at 30% capacity. It's obvious that only so many transactions can fit in limited blockspace.

Why has the dev team allowed this to happen? I get that it's ""open source"" or whatever, but if this was a dev team at a real company... would they have jobs?

I'm okay with differences of opinion about *how* to scale bitcoin -- but the fact that it's gotten this bad at all is horrifying. Why is the network on fire? How is this good for anyone?"

If you are having trouble seeing your balance on some wallet software, try refreshing or resyncing somehow (depends on the software).

The default lowest setting in electrum gives you an expected confirmation over 25 blocks. What probably happened is that bitcoin was hit with a wave of transactions that have a higher fee per kb than yours shortly after your transaction was broadcasted. Note that the fees estimates are for the current fee discribution on the network. If that changes the expected time for confirmation of unconfirmed transactions also changes.

That said this tx will probably confirm once the wave is over, or if you're in a hurry and have replace by fee enabled you can bump the fee.The fee is too low, that is why it takes so long. It was confirmed

Check if you're running the latest version of Electrum

2016-11-22 23:20:24;Jameson Lopp on Twitter: I've yet to see any indications that current txn backlog is a spam attack. Fees look fairly evenly distributed.;"UTXO behavior looks highly suspect. https://blockchain.info/charts/utxo-count?timespan=60daysIf you looked at the fees yesterday, they were almost all way under the recommended fee of 12 cents that was recommended for at least the past week (70 satoshis/byte). https://bitcoinfees.21.co/


So I have to agree with /u/nullc that it looks highly suspicious.


But in the end it doesnât matter whether it was a spam attack or not. Itâs pointless to debate such a thing because itâs almost impossible to prove whether it was or was not.


What matters is that we need to find a solution to this problem.these people totally ignore the fact that if you look at the graph of the mempool you see a sudden huge increase in size almost out of nowhere. Like , yeah, it's totally normal to have an explosion of transactions out of nowhere, they seem to think we're idiots with how much they try to spin it. Not to mention the fact that this spam attack has been carried out so many times now it's just too obvious, so we know exactly what is happening yet the BU supporters still try to act blind like this is all totally normal.It doesn't look very evenly distributed. Note the surge in tx at 50-60 sat/B when mempool  is already at 2 MB mark for tx > 50 sat/B:
https://bitcointools.github.io/images/bitcoinfeedistr7d.pngThat just means attack bot getting more sophisticated. But I haven't looked so not saying if is or isn't likely.Fees don't indicate whether or not something is spam...Regardless of whether this specific incident is a spam attack, it's clear that at the current level of usage any real uptick in adoption would result in a similar backlog. People seem to still fundamentally misunderstand why the mempool fills (not Lopp, but many commentors here). Look at the tx per sec rate: https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/historical/6h-f-tps-01091-tfee_blk_avg-01031     
Note the steady growth. Note the ebbs and flows (monday/tuesday peaks). Now if we have 6 blocks per hour and an avg tx size of 510 bytes what can we handle? 995,000 bytes available for tx every ten min / 510 = 1950 tx per block. 1950 / 600 seconds = 3.25 tx per second.      
What would happen if the tx rate managed to edge above this for (most of) 24 hours, with an average tx rate at 3.60 tx/ps and rarely dipped below 3.25tx/ps?       

3.60 * 600 = 2160 ---*tx rate times # sec between blocks*      
2160 - 1950 = 210  ---*# tx that cannot be added to next block*       
210 * 144 = 30,240 ---*tx that couldn't be added to next block times # blocks in 24 hour span*     
      

So very quickly, a tiny increase in the tx/per sec rate for any sustained amount of time **will** cause the mempool to grow for **every** tx beyond this 3.25 per sec mark and that is how you can get 30,000 or more tx in the mempool through organic growth. I'd gladly bet a million satoshi this'll happen again around 11/29, 12/6, 12/13, or 12/20.         
The dead giveaway that it isn't spam (+ that it doesn't matter) is that these are not low fee txs. The fee rate per tx has steadily risen. Even if it were expensive spam, it would only take like 15 tx per minute to make enough of a difference to fill up the mempool like this. That's such an insignificant amount of tx that it doesnt really matter if it were spam, it could just as easily be organic, or a few hours in a row where we average 5.5 blocks mined instead of 6.        
    

**Put another way:**        
 If you are in a swimming pool and your mouth is two feet above the water or two inches above the water what difference does it make in your ability to breath? None.     
If your mouth were two inches *below* the water or two feet *below* the water, what difference would this distance make in your ability to breath? None.     
You breathe fine at a depth of <5 feet, and drown at a depth of >5 feet. We've spent every tuesday-wednesday inches around this point all year. You just don't notice it unless you're one of the ones stuck drowning in the pool.So it's a natural thing that the backlog go from 2k to 57k ?It has to be a spam attack, unless this has something to do with what's going on in India."

2. so each shard (hash bucket) corresponds to a single service type, right, eg a DNS service.  Does that mean that if I'm running a DNS service node that I must process ALL the transactions for that service?

If every DNS node must process all DNS tx, it seems to me that the DNS service will soon bump into the same types of scalability issues that bitcoin has now.

( If you think there are not enough DNS tx to cause trouble, just consider if visa decided to run as an Aspen service. )

Or is there a further level of sharding that somehow divides the DNS service tx between nodes?

Free market will naturally provide good money if the State refuses to uphold that part of its social contract.Just another day in the People's Republic of Australia.They inflate the money supply with QE and drive it's value down forcing citizens to use higher denominations and then label the increase in such denominations as 'suspect' and 'illegal'.Aaron Russo suggested this  eliminating cash would happen in his interview

From Aaron Russo's Documentary ''America Freedom To Fascism''  regarding government's plan to have complete control over currency:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuinaIm-kd4[deleted]I doubt they will do it in the USA anytime soon because USD is world's reserve currency and a move like that would put many foreign holders of $100 notes in a bad position and also hurt the demand for USD and that would cause their value to drop.

But likely the US gov't will at some point limit the amount of cash that can be used in business transactions.  That is being done in Europe already in some places.FUCKING SHIT CUNT!!!So who's next? EU? The domino start falling eh?Is any of you responsible for this?How is that great news?Keep fueling the rocket !!This is fucked, living in Australia I'd HOPED we would never see this but always thought there'd be players pushing for this to happen... sad state of affairsI did math.

So they are talking about banning %46.7 of value in circulation in banknotes. Thats almost half the money. I hope you realize that they are phasing out paper to force digital money. While Bitcoin may serve that purpose, Bitcoin may serve that purpose!

This is not good.The last time I used cash was when it was given to me, everything is paypass, paypal or bitcoin for me these days.

This was expected to happen sooner or later and they will be slowly phasing out ALL denominations in due time, I mean hell we barely even use shrapnel (coins) anymore.

All this means is people should not be investing in cash but actual physical goods these days that can be traded in ANY value at the time of sale ie a goods for goods economy.Seriously, the only time I see them is cashing out at the casino. ATMs pretty much all give out $50s in my experience. Fine by me, and if btc gets a minor bump, great.I made a bet

Will Australia start to phase out the Australian $100 Note before April 2017?

betmoose.com/bet/will-australia-ban-the-100-note-2472I always read these articles and get this weird feeling that I'm like the only person on the planet that declares their cash income.I strongly disagree with the ""great news"" part. I wish we would live in a world where we don't need bitcoin.

The world is not a zero-sum-game. Sure, holding bitcoin you might get ahead of people who were economically ahead of you in fiat but the friction introduced by fascist states makes the world as a whole worse off. The very fact that the brightest minds I know are now dedicating their lives to a technology that solves a man-made problem instead of getting us to mars and beyond or figuring out how to survive artificial super intelligence is deeply saddening.I wonder how this would play out in the US, with companies like Western Union making tremendous profit from transferring money I'd imagine they would fight it tooth and nail. does Australia not have these huge business interests fighting this? Aussie Bank To Unseat R3 & Hyperledger In Blockchain Development Race

Australian banks are ready to replace both the R3 Blockchain Consortium and the Linux Hyperledger projects in the position of leaders who drive the development of Blockchain technology. This future is predicted by Thomas McAlister, an Australian expert at Bankcoin Reserve Pty Ltd, who works with governments and their central banks.

The Commonwealth Bank Of Australia embraces blockchain technology in a move that will see the bank develop its own blockchain hub later in 2020. The bank is implementing an ambitious goal of the Sydney government set up earlier in 2014.

https://steemit.com/steemit/@dollarvigilante/the-case-for-buying-steem-and-steem-power-the-dollar-vigilante-says-steem-is-now-a-buy> âIf a company is issuing 25 new shares every 10 minutes, clearly this would constitute a stock split (continuously) and therefore the historical price of that stock would need to be adjusted to reflect the stock split (this is how it works today),â Mr. Lingham writes. âHowever, in âBitcoinland,â this is ignored.â

I respect vinnylingham as an entrepreneur, but those statements are seriously confused..

 1. A stock split does not affect the market cap; in a 2:1 split 10 shares @ $10/ea become 20 shares @ $5/ea, etc. This is not the same as dilution (issuance of new shares) or inflation (issuance of new currency).

 2. The inflation rate of Bitcoin is deterministic and extremely well-known, and is certainly factored into the exchange rate by both buyers and sellers.All metrics? How's about the USD/btc metric?"

2016-12-20 23:50:32;Victimized of double-spending, $90 transaction ended up losing me $400;"bc.i lets you spend unconfirmed payments from third parties? -- and even does so automatically? :(

By lost, I am assuming you mean a trade you missed out on?  If you just mean the funds hung up in the invalidated transaction-- you still have those. I believe bc.i's wallet will let you spend them again after a couple days; otherwise you can export the keys into a new wallet and sweep them.

In Bitcoin Core you would just right-click the transaction, choose abandon (which it will permit because it is conflicted) and then they would be released back to your wallet. (though Bitcoin Core's wallet will not spend funds from a third party without at least 6 confirms, so it wouldn't have gotten into this state in the first place.)
It's not clear why you think you lost $400. I only see the $90 transaction as being double spent. Talk to the person that sent the $90 to you and ask them to send it again.

In general, accepting unconfirmed bitcoins can be risky and spending them can cause problems for you and the person receiving them.

In the end, all the transactions will disappear (including the $90 sent to you), but you will have to wait.First off, you haven't lost anything other than the 0.1136402 BTC that was double-spent on you.

I would recommend using a better wallet than blockchain.info's offering. Ideally one that allows you to tell it not to attempt to spend unconfirmed coins. Definitely one that doesn't attempt to spent coins which will definitely never confirm - that's just crazy behavior on b.i's part.

If it was me I would export the private keys from blockchain.info's wallet, import them in Bitcoin Core, and spend them from there. You probably don't have a synced up copy of Bitcoin Core, and it can take quite a long time to sync the blockchain, so maybe you don't want to go that route. If you do, let me know and I'll walk you through it.

Alternatively, if you're willing to trust me with your coins I can move them to a new address for you. But of course I understand if you're wary of doing that.You can't lose more than the transaction. Maybe you're mistaking a change address. Give it time to settle, you didn't and cannot lose $400. That's not how Bitcoin works. Also you can't be a double spend victim as a senderThe transaction never confirmed and was dropped from mempool. Looks like your inputs are still in place.

For example, ArtForz, one of the biggest early miners, reported to Satoshi several absolutely critical bugs which could've utterly destroyed Bitcoin if not handled very early on. If someone had tempted him with the offer of buying all of his BTC at the amazingly-high price of $20/BTC or whatever, maybe he would've left the Bitcoin community earlier than he did in reality, before he would've found these bugs.

2016-12-27 23:20:16;Can Bitcoin Exist Only as a Store of Value?;"Yes.>But doesnât gold work this way? Today the demand for gold is well above the demand derived from goldâs industrial use cases. Isnât all that excess demand just people people using it as a store of value? No!

That excess demand comes from speculators who are speculating that gold will take on new use cases at some point in the future. If the dollar collapses itâs reasonable to think that gold might play a role in whatever monetary system emerges from the ashes. If some nations switch to a gold standard, or if central banks start buying gold for their reserves, or even if people are bartering directly with gold coins, then gold will be demanded for those purposes

This understanding of gold when highlighted will allow your ignorance on the subject to shine through to the well read and knowledgeable players. That gold's price comes largely from speculators of use cases is silly.  Gold is looked at as an inflation hedge vs fiat's because of the nature of its cost of mining especially (and of course ultimately its supply).

>If the collapse never happens, if world governments suddenly learn fiscal responsibility, if central banks suddenly reverse course on their loose monetary policy, then Iâd expect the price of gold to trend downwards as it becomes clear those new use cases are not materializing. """"

Yes but you ignore how special of an event it would be if our governments printed stable money.

>All of this talk about Bitcoin as a pure store of value seems to be ignoring the basic concept of liquidity preference. Suppose a hypothetical money where the central bank manages to maintain a stable value.""

This hypothetical is not otherwise possible without the introduction of a stable deflationary (in relation to gold) currency.  But now that it is, such a hypothetical would allegedly bring bliss, as, and Nash perfectly explains this in ideal Money, it is exactly the problem society is trying to, and needs to solve in order to end conflict in this world.

Regardless of your ignorance, you perfectly paint the bridge to Nash's insights.And yet in the year that two block size fork attempts have failed (and a third is obviously failing), bitcoin rises to new all time highs.

Mining with GPU is pointless nowadays. 

Bitcoin mining is different than it was 3 or 4 years ago (you have probably seen some videos from that time). Now it's industrialized (large warehouses, very cheap power and labour, modern special-purpose mining integrated circuits), see [here](https://www.google.cz/search?q=bitcoin+warehouse&source=lnms&tbm=isch).I was never a miner, but I think Ethereum and Zcash are mined with GPUs. You could mine them, then sell for bitcoinsIf you want to mine with your video card then check out Ethereum or Zcash as they are currently ASIc-resistant, so you should Fair well with your GPU.

Bitcoin mining with GPU is long gone...If I had bought coins directly instead of purchasing the very first ASIC machines, I would have over 10x the amount of coins. The same held true when I bought GPU's before that. Looking back, it was _always_ wiser to buy the coins instead of mining...Thanks for the info. Very good to knowWhat graphics card do you have?

It's possible you might be able to mine some altcoin and exchange it for bitcoin. You won't make much with only 1 gpu, but if you already have the hardware you can put it to use and at least try.

Also keep in mind electrical costs have the potential wipe out any profits pretty quickly. Essentially you are buying bitcoin through your electric bill and not for a large return/profit."

I don't believe I've seen any evidence that the people within those two countries have played a major role in recent price movement. It might however be that they or people in other countries (as implied earlier) were the small force that caused the avalanche that had been building up since the halving for an example.

Thanks!You've misunderstood.

It's not that Venezuelans or Indians or Cypriots are personally driving demand, it's people in wealthy countries with the money and means to buy Bitcoin who, having looked at what is happening in those countries and the rest of the financial world, realise that demand for Bitcoin will inevitably grow in future.

He's been doing it for decades. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. I'm struggling to grasp what this video has to do with Bitcoin. Peter Schiff isn't a bitcoiner -- far from it -- and, as far as I can tell, nothing in this video is relevant to bitcoin, except to say, ""look, Peter Schiff is a smart guy, perhaps we should take his recent critiques of bitcoin seriously.""

Honestly, I think at least some of Schiff's concerns over bitcoin derive simply from the fact that bitcoin's success is potentially threatening to gold, Schiff's main business. 

But, that aside, his critique of bitcoin essentially boils down to the idea that bitcoin is Monopoly money. Put more precisely, he thinks that it lacks intrinsic value, and that it's limited supply is an illusion because cryptocurrencies are infinitely reproducible. 

But he is focused on the digital token and not Bitcoin's underlying value proposition which derives from its public blockchain and the network.

Schiff's argument is a bit like saying Google was never going to go anywhere because anyone with some programming skill could create a search engine. Sure, anyone can create a blockchain, but unless it offers some fundamental advantages over Bitcoin's, no one will use it.

Once you understand this you can see that Bitcoin does have a kind of emergent intrinsic value -- just as Google did -- and that value comes from the blockchain. This certainly doesn't guarantee that Bitcoin won't be overcome by one of its competitors, particularly if its blockchain ultimately proves to be inferior. But it is to say that you can't simply say that because an unlimited number of blockchains can be created, none of them have value. That's like saying Amazon has no value because there's no limit to the number of online retail stores that can be created. 

Did Peter mention something about Bitcoin recently? Does this clip relate to bitcoin in any way?? NO so GTFO..

100% an employee of peter schiff upload this clip to make the users here feel shiff is always right, so they then start to think he is right about his negative views of bitcoin too..

Peter schiff clips only belong on this subreddit when he is talking about bitcoin.. which is fine even if it is negative because it gives us some comedy to laugh at coz his arguments are just so stupid and illogical and blantantly wrong!"

2017-01-17 23:56:56;What is the risk to selling bitcoins locally. Visiting localbitcoins.com I see what seems a huge markup on btc. Why is that?;"People are willing to pay a premium to buy btc with cashLocalbitcoins is a market. Sellers pay the commission or listing fee plus a profit. As a buyer you can put an order in to buy at whatever price you want. No one is telling or forcing you. It also doesn't mean you will get that price. Nor will the seller. Hi!

With Local trades one reason you see a price premium is because it takes a lot of TIME to do a local trade. From you talking with the seller and deciding a meetup point, to the traders travel time and cost to the meeting point and then to making the exchange itself.

People who sell Bitcoin don't do it for charity, they want to gain some profit for it.

Because local trades are very time consuming the premium is higher than, say, cash deposit trades where the seller can sit at home and refresh his online banking and do complete trades at once.Its all handled by the site when you start a transaction.  It doesn't have to do with risk."

The s5's are almost certainly not profitable to run anymore, being two generations old. The S7 may still be profitable depending on your electricity cost and if you have a PSU you can use it with (1600W PSU is recommended).

Plug it in, turn it on, log in and point it to your mining pool of choice and if you've played your cards right, you may just pull in a bit more BTC than it costs you to run it.What you have there is wasted money unfortunately.U can mail me a s5 :)Go to work.

    If you send bitcoins before all blocks are downloaded, you must ensure that the balances shown aren't impacted by a later block.

2017-03-21 23:41:18;How will Bitcoin Money Supply Loss;"Deflation isn't a bad thing, it means that savers are rewarded and the inflationary boom-bust cycles aren't as prominent.This is my set of assumptions:

- Lost bitcoin will result in selling pressure not existing that would otherwise be there. 

- If the bitcoin market continues to grow or even just remains static this will result in increases in prices. 

- As prices increase people will likely start transacting in smaller units.

- If people are sending and saving smaller units then when they lose some it will be a smaller and smaller amount

- Over time technology and familiarity will help people lose their funds less often.

If these assumptions hold true then the supply will decay at some less than asymptotic rate until there are no more technological improvements to prevent loss of wallets and then it will stabilize at some percentage of the total supply.

> Is this a problem?

Not particularly. There is a current limit to how divisible bitcoin is but more decimal places can be added without much difficulty, its not like the block size debate which has security implications. "

I think I answer many of your questions on my site here: https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com

If you're looking for long-term storage, I think BIP-38 encrypted paper wallets (several copies of each, stored in various locations e.g. home, safety deposit box) is the best choice.You use 3 paper copies not hardwaresDo you have an iPhone, or android?

Bitcoin is not broken by any stretch of the imagination, as such implementing segwit is a want, not necessarily a need. 

It's a desired change that will improve many things going forward. However like all other proposals nothing *needs* to happen right now.Litecoin becomes the dominant coin. The world moves ahead while bitcoin stays the same. Greed is bad.The majority of people with tech backgrounds support segwit. It's a no brainer to solve tx malleability.

If a solution is not agreed on ""soon enough"" - the world will continue to turn.  Relax.Transaction fees continue to rise probably> pretty evenly split.

It is not, you have been misinformed. The overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem supports activating segwit.

Opposition comes from a single self-mining ASIC manufacturer BitMain (Jihan Wu) and Roger Ver plus his army of BU shills attempting to divide the community.

Users and most major companies have explicitly voiced their support for Bitcoin and its current team of 100+ developers."
2017-04-04 23:21:44;Does UASF BIP 148 Include a Difficulty Adjustment?;"No, that would require a hardfork as difficulty adjusted blocks would be rejected by older nodes negating deployment as a softfork.
short answer: noBlocks will be slow, but they'll still be found. You'll still be able to send transactions, they'll just take longer to confirm and you'll have to pay a higher fee on them. The higher fees will attract more miners over to the BIP148 chain, speeding the process up.

If we do actually have an economic majority backing the UASF, it shouldn't take long for miners to switch over, since they want to get paid. At 50% the non-SF chain ceases to exist, so even 35-40% should be enough to pull any stragglers over.> As I understand, all major exchanges will be accepting this fork

That is just what they *need* and *hope for* but there has been no announcement from an exchange on the matter, to my knowledge. Perhaps a few of the exchanges that trade small altcoins will step up first. Perhaps they'd start trading a futures contract or a Chain Split Token, and then we'd have a market *before* UASF activates. That would be interesting to see."

From the Q&A it seems that SNARKs is what we would like to have in bitcoin. The reason cryptographers are hesistant about SNARKs is because the cryptographic assumptions used for SNARKs are relatively new right?

Also, with SNARKs can you fully trace computation like you can with the existing Script language? Or is it essentially a black box predicate that evaluates to true or false?Nice. My blockchain is coded in VBA-Excel and it has stateful INTERCAL smart contracts.Just looked at this again and this is probably one of the best r/bitcoin threads I've seen. Mind blown. Thanks.It's very interesting talk about why Turing complete language is unnecessary, but I didn't get the part of why it is harmful and what kind of attacks can be done easier on it.It's very interesting talk about why Turing complete language is unnecessary, but I didn't get the part of why it is harmful and what kind of attacks can be done easier on it.ITT: Nothing that I understand.I might be completely off here but isn't this what this 'aeternity' thingy is trying to do?I remember CFB (on Nxt POS) talking about the danger of Turing completeness long before ETH.

You are talking about over 14 years to simply double the blocksize. >Issue with Unlimited is that it provides the tools to kill off smaller competition. Only a very few pools, the biggest of all will survive in the long run.

What data backs up this statement? Until data is presented, it is just an opinion. And we shouldn't act on opinions.This one seems to be what you're looking for: https://medium.com/@spair/a-simple-adaptive-block-size-limit-748f7cbcfb75

With that, 51% miners can veto any increase.Most of us sane developers and users agree that blocksize increase is needed at some point, and many (including myself) would welcome that change **today.**  But Bitcoin Unlimited's so-called ""Emergent Consensus"" implementation is total horseshit.  You don't need to read many opinions on it, you don't need to watch many talks, you can read the bare fucking code for youself.  Admittedly, understanding it is a bit harder...  And you may end up needed to read other peoples' assessments (and opinions) after all, but if you're reading this then I'm confident that you can use the internet to learn to understand bitcoin's code in a shorter time than you might expect.

Kinda rambly, sorry.  I agree with you.

> ""The free market"" should not decide, because majority hash rate is not the market

It may be more accurate to say that the miners are not the free market in and of themselves...  But I also disagree with the notion that all matters should be determined be the (or a) free market.You would need to get 51% of hash power combined to force the blocksize up. 51% of miners already have the ability to do that. What does BU change? Arguably it make signalling easier is all.

> because majority hash rate is not the market.

Majority hash rate controls transaction admission to the blockchain: it is quite literally the market.Still doesn't solve the node issue. my .02 bitcoin cents: an exponentially growing block size is a really^really^really^really bad idea. "
2017-04-18 23:04:01;Double spend question;"0-confirmation transactions can always be double-spent (especially if they are flagged as RBF).

For high value transactions, the recipient should always wait for 1 or more confirmations. For low value transactions, merchants kind of expect/hope the customers will not defraud them... It's like when they give you the dish in the restaurant and then the drink ...and they expect/hope that you will not run without paying at the end. 

(Edit: There are also algorithms that guess the chance of the transaction making it into the blockchain - depending on it's fee, that it has no unconfirmed parents, that it's doublespends were not seen yet, etc...)This issue has been blown WAY out of proportion.

**Can** this happen, YES. But how often is someone going to go through all this trouble to **rip off** a coffee shop owner for $4.50?!?!?!?

The best way to think about this is to compare it to counterfeit money. Can a dollar bill be counterfeit, YES. Do coffee shops accept counterfeit bills everyday, YES. Does this mean they should **stop** accepting cash?... NO!!!!

Counterfeit bills are used to buy things everyday. From big retail stores to Mom&Pops shops... They all take steps to make sure every bill they accept is real, yet everyday a counterfeit bill makes it into the register.

Accepting counterfeit money is just part of doing business, and it's factored into the price. That $4.50 coffee would only cost you $4.45 if **no one** passed counterfeit bills.

So why to coffee shops accept cash? Because.... Most people are honest! Most people don't pass counterfeit money. They just want to pay $4.50 for some coffee and be on their way. And it's only a very small percentage of the population that pass counterfeit money.

With Bitcoin, it will be the same. The vast majority of Bitcoin users will be honest and just want their coffee and be on their way. They're **not** going to be dishonest, and go out of their way, to rip the coffee shop owner off for FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS!

On big ticket items, yes, this is currently an issue. But fear not, fixes are on the way.

SegWit will allow for the Lightening Network. If you use the Lightening Network and open a channel to the coffee shop, you can send bitcoin to them through the channel and it's **instant** (1, maybe 2 seconds and it's confirmed). 

And then there's RSK. RSK doesn't even need SegWit, and it near the end of it's testing phase. It could go live next month! RSK will give us up to 400 transactions per second (2,000 when Lumino compress is added a few months later), Ethereum ""like"" contracts, and 10 second confirmations!!!!

Yes, that's right... 10 second confirmations!!!! I never had a coffee shop get my drink ready in less than 10 seconds.

So if you still feel this is an issue, wait a month for RSK, and signal for Segwit.

I'm helping all I can by signaling for SegWit with my mining, and I'm signaling with my node too.Bingo! Why Bitcoin doesn't make sense as a payment network, in a nutshell.

Bitcoin's blockchain is *slow*, but it's still dramatically faster than moving tonnes of gold around, right? So, Bitcoin really makes sense as a settlement network, savings, and things that can wait an hour to be confirmed.

Payment layers belong on top, with other tradeoffs, higher speed, and less security.Credit card payments can be charged back up to 3 months after purchase. Stores don't wait for three months to give you coffee.

However, the higher the amount, the more likely VISA is to look at the case thoroughly before processing a chargeback.

Similar (if not better) to that, bitcoin can guarantee no chargebacks after about 3 blocks, so 30 minutes or so, not to mention escrow multisig is possible to drive down chargeback time to 0 assuming the escrow is trustworthy (falling back to the VISA model)

tl;dr for coffees, 0-conf is fine. If you find your bitcoin user fraud rate is too high, stop taking it as payment. I have seen small stores cease to accept credit cards because they had high chargeback rates."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/668mx7/taiwan_aml_reforms_usdcrypto_drama/

Just curious. 

What exchange does the OP recommend? Coinbase? A lot of people do not trust US exchanges for tons of reasons. IRS and government requests for their data. This is particularly true for European/Asian people. So what exchange is the OP suggesting that is not US based?

The US is also very behind regarding cryptocurrency services vs the rest of the world. Just look as an example how the banking system in the US works. As someone that has US bank accounts and in other parts of the worlds, I can tell you that US banks are in the stone age. Most don't have second-factor authentication today in 2017. Most don't even allow wire transfers outside the US unless you go to the bank and local transfers inside the US take 2-3 days. And most don't have anything regarding online banking features besides letting you check your funds and a simple password and security question. And I'm talking here about major US banks.

Now, let's see Europe. What a different story.... Not only do they have every possible security feature and integration with phone, paying bills, wire to everywhere with exchange currencies but the systems are impressive (not to mention free wires inside Europe while the US charges you even inside the US).

EU banks, to make a transfer, I have to take a hardware device, put in my debit card inside and then scan a code on the screen. Only then I get my TAN code + password and even have to confirm with a phone everything.

Credit cards. Same story. The US does not even have the smart chip while Europe has it for 10 years. And the US financial system is very overstepping into anything that ventures into financial services. Just look the horrible stories about people with PayPal and other companies asking them all types of information from original copies of passports (yes, the IRS in some cases does not even accept copies...) and other stuff.

Long story short. The rest of the world does not trust the US financial system, and neither after Wall Street ripped billions from foreign banks and then the US government decided to bail them out with huge a bonus as a reward for the biggest ponzi scheme in the history of this planet.

I have to sadly confirm personally that US market exchanges for cryptocurrencies do not have the trust or confidence from people outside the US after talking with more than one person. I would dare to say that not even US citizens trust them based on how the IRS is requesting every single account from Coinbase today.

So again. I ask the OP, what market exchange would you recommend today?What is your goal from this post?Oh my god, okcoin.com went to 1% within bfx's price (now standing at 2.8% spread), I guess they're a ponzi too!!! /halflogicMore bitfinex founding drama, developer claims he was not given promised payment (10% dividends) and was removed from being able to see Bitfinex's financial data:

2017-05-02 23:36:38;Running a full node on Amazon AWS?;"t2.small with 2GB is enough but not ideal (will take a long time to sync, but you could sync to EBS on a larger instance and attach to a small one). And it's only the beginning of your costs. Add storage space of ~120 GB plus **bandwidth**, which is the real killer on AWS.

Also, don't bother with Windows. You'd be much better to run an Ubuntu instance and use spot instances (a fraction of on demand charges, < $0.01/hr.)  to get base cost down. But bandwidth will still make almost any other VPS option cheaper. 

Assuming you have some need for a remote full node I'd suggest Vultr.com as they accept BTC, have simpler instance controls, free bandwith (limited), and charged per hour so you don't commit to full months just like AWS. Also, they've been giving away free block storage that helps with cutting that cost.

($10 : 2 CPU, 40 GB SSD) + ($10 : 100 GB block storage) or ($20 : 4 CPU, 60 GB SSD) + 50GB free block storage (if deal still offered). Either 2TB or 3TB bandwidth included. I've used them for full nodes for development and you can start/stop as needed so cut costs to small fraction if need be.

edit: You don't need to learn much Linux to run a full node. eg. start node, add PPA for access to bitcoin repo, apt-get update and apt-get install bitcoind. And you're going. There are plenty of tutorials kicking around for that.No. Full nodes are only meaningful if you run them on hardware *you exclusively control*. VPS are useless.

Also, Windows is backdoored, so very far from ideal for anything important.So what happens when Amazon shuts down your node, censor you or even worse holds it for ransom.

It's possible to import the seed into another wallet and try to doublespend it with a higher fee, but that is quite annoying in itself as the seed recovery differs slightly between many wallets, and has the added risk of exposing your keys to another software and/or machine.

Core nodes since v0.12. drop unconfirmed TX after 72 hours, so there's a good chance it will be confirmed or dropped within that timeframe.

However in the meantime we can get LN working properly in wallets and with UI on LTC and start building the backend network. It's not like that would be large scale production ready in August 2017 if we had segwit for BTC then. Granted segwit would already help by increasing the number of tx that can be made but for the growth challenges ahead LN is even more important and dilgigence + patience now will pay off.

People genuinely concerned Bitcoin will not survive another year before the scaling debate is solved can hedge with LTC / ETH.

for me, a Bitcoin compromising one pillar of decentralization the other is doomed to become a covert corporate/ or bank-coin, unless it fails completely.

It resolves a long standing issue with BTC and makes it more viable than it already is AFAIK.

Leading up to BIP148 we may see no changes in price (because it's locked in or the market doesn't care), an increase (because people see that BIP148 is good for the longevity of BTC), or a decrease (because people are scared and unsure of what will happen).

No one can tell you for sure. Look at the halvening. So many people thought we were going to the moon after it and that leading up to it we'd see a huge drop off. Neither happened. Price was basically locked in/market didn't care.

The market at this point, is a bunch of whales moving it around via cascade events regardless of news.If BIP148 succeeds it breaks the scaling deadlock.

Suddenly we have 2MB blocks that are lightning ready. Transactions fees will be lower than altcoins, sounds bullish to me.It will dip around the time BIP148 is activated because people are scared.

Coinbase even put up prompts on my dashboard instructing me to switch.

This fee squeeze should be a wake-up call regardless of its cause. Nobody who actually uses bitcoin to make small purchases such as hosting (a very good use case BTW) wants to lose that.

You can look at this and conclude that Bitcoin has failed as a P2P electronic cash system.

Or... you could look at it as creating a bounty for a workable solution. Right now that solution appears to be alternative tokens such as ether and litecoin. I don't think that will last for long, though.

If the alternatives reach the same level of economic sophistication and scale as Bitcoin, they too will show signs of stress. They will all come face to face with the same problem: how to keep electronic cash fungible while scaling orders of magnitude.

This problem has been with Bitcoin since the beginning:

http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09963.html

This is no easy problem, but the difference is that now there's a payoff for solving it.There's a fundamental issue that is being ignored over and over when these discussions occur.

> The demand for one-time-fee permanent storage space is unlimited.

Corporations and other entities will *always* be ready to pay up to a certain amount for permanent storage. They can use this in a variety of ways, such as proof of ownership or as a protocol on which other services are built or they are simply spamming.

I would be tempted to write ""cflvx was here, 2017-06-14"" on the blockchain if it cost me $.01, but probably not if it cost me $1.

I could run a business that lets people register a PDF and prove ownership. They give me a public key and the hash and I put those on the blockchain. They can later prove that the PDF is theirs by signing a message using the corresponding private key above. Great for copyright disputes or what have you. If I can sell that cheap enough, people would pay for it. (See e.g. https://www.crossref.org/fees/ for an example of pricing for this type of service, in this case for DOI numbers.)

People wanting storage are, however, not ready to pay *any* amount, only up to a certain point. We could draw a graph with the xâ axis being the tx fee and the yâ axis being the number of people willing to pay that amount to store stuff. It would look something like this:

        :
    v â|
    o | |
    l |  \
    u |   \_
    m |     \___
    e +---------â
          fees/b

As feeâ0, volumeââ. Under normal circumstances (there are exceptions), everyone tries to get away with as low fees as possible. This creates a backlog of low-priority transactions which are deferred in favor of more profitable transactions. There is obviously a cap on this -- there is a point at which people simply prefer to wait rather than pay higher transaction fees -- and that point has turned out to be unintuitively *high* with bitcoin. This is coupled with the fact the BTC has tripled in value over a short period of time. I doubt anyone is sad about that part, but it does play a part in transaction fees as well, when considered from the perspective of fiat rates.

(Note that so far, I haven't even touched on standard transactions where A sends x BTC to B, the above is all about users wanting permanent storage.)

Let's go back to block size, then. If we increase the block size, we double the space into which transactions can be inserted. This will churn down the tx fees initially, but presuming you buy my statement above about the correlation between fees and (storage) volume, you will see that the storage users will fill blocks until an initial ""storage fee equilibrium"" is reached, which will be the same as it is now (for these users).

After this it's simply a matter of users and how much they are willing to spend in transaction fees. I am very hesitant to move bitcoins right now because fees are so high. I am not alone. As the fees go up, the number of people willing to transfer gradually drops. The graph for tx fees over btc transfer volume, if you were to draw it, would look quite similar to the graph above; if fees did get close to 0, people would be willing to spend smaller amounts of bitcoin for cheap stuff. (On-chain cup of coffee etc.) Consequently, the transfer volume would also rise in inverse correlation with transaction fees.

Raising the block size will give a momentary relief until the market catches up and then we will be back right where we started. It may be slightly less intense for a bit but, presuming bitcoin remains as attractive as it is (and most factors indicate it will -- absurd tx fees not preventing people from flocking to it being one clear case of this), it will soon be at the exact same position it was before the block size increase.

A block size increase is a hard fork, and hard forks have an inherent risk of a coin split. In addition, research indicates that the maximum block size that the network can sustain at the moment is 4 MB (this is why SegWit has a 4 MB max weight, btw). People, including Bitcoin Core folks, are trying to come up with a way to do this in a safe and seamless way, and have come up with several ideas so far. But alternatives which do not require a hard fork, like second layer tech (lightning), sidechains, signature aggregation via schnorr (via segwit soft fork of script version) etc. are simly more attractive at this point in time. These people take this limitation very seriously, and are dying to fix it just like everybody else. They just don't believe a block size increase will, probably for reasons similar to those I stated above.

Meanwhile, the proponents of a blocksize increase are yelling bloody murder while simultaneously mining empty blocks, and when they're not, they are happily collecting huge transaction fees. Meanwhile, they are blocking segwit, which, according to a lot of people, would actually fix this problem. That should give you an indication of what they are actually aiming at.

tl;dr: block size irrelevant.

Edit: deconfused.great, we want Segwit, good luck...1) Why would you disclose how much you sold off on Reddit of all places?

2) You still have a good amount of BTC left... indicating you have a fair amount of confidence in it.

Forever and always.

The best solution is segwit, which fixes the asicboost centralization problem + enables second layer payment mechanisms that utilize bitcoin for its greatest feature as a digital currency: security. Increasing blocksize lowers the security and is nothing more than a band-aid.It seems you never understood bitcoin.

Did you somehow not see that the blockspace would fill up?

Scaling Bitcoin is one of the hardest problems in IT.$7 to move that much value is dirt cheap!  You just confirmed how great Bitcoin still is.> and all that has to be done to solve the problem is the block size increase.

False, That would make the problem worse.

The problem we have is that a group of unscrupulous miners is blocking SegWit (hello Jihan). A raw max block size increase would give them even more power. 

Not gonna happen.

SegWit is a *safe* more efficient use of the current block size. The side channels it allows are what you are seeking. It also does it without the very real danger of even further mining power centralization that increasing block size would bring.

After SegWit is implemented, then we can talk about further *safe* scaling solutions. The invention didn't go to waste. A lot of people are now tinkering with it, trying different parameters, new approaches, etc.

2017-06-27 23:38:14;Goldman Sachs recently launched a new blockchain page. One of the coolest web pages I've seen;"[Blockchain or Bitcoin: Understanding the Differences.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRQs9Y6CUSU&index=13&list=FLTEqQN8F-fQWrtvt5A5V5WQ&t=1927s)

Live it learn it. One of the most important aspects they leave out as an important characteristic of useful blockchains is immutability. As Andreas so aptly puts it- immutability is an artifact of proof of work, NOT BLOCKCHAINS. If you say, ""I have a blockchain"", that means nothing if it is not immutable, open, secure, public, distributed. All of these facets are lost on this page to the magic sauce of ""hurr durr blerkchains so hot right now muh millenialz will uze to get hot ticketz for Coachella eazy peazy lemon squeazy"".

Just watch the fucking video and observe the master at work. He articulates it FAR better than I ever could. **Goldman Sucks**Pretty cool website, even through they still don't understand that they don't want to own or control the transaction log. It would be unnecessary, insecure and expensive even just to try.Why why do they use singular when talking about ""Blockchain"".  

For example they have:
> Blockchain has the potential to change the way we buy and sell, interact with government and verify the authenticity of everything from property titles to organic vegetables.

It should be :
> Blockchains have the potential to change the way we buy and sell, interact with government and verify the authenticity of everything from property titles to organic vegetables.

Or:
> Blockchain technology has the potential to change the way we buy and sell, interact with government and verify the authenticity of everything from property titles to organic vegetables.
""A blockchain needs to do two things: gather and order data into blocks, and then chain them together securely using cryptography.""

No, that is Git. A blockchain needs a proof of work algorithm to select the correct chain and make it immutable. 

Boggles my mind that an entire organisation can completely miss the point. I know they are just using it as a buzzword to dazzle mediocre middle managers into buying their other awful consulting services, but still. If they had actually tried to implement a blockchain, they would have realised this. Fairly cool website, but it's completely wasted on all that *""herp derp luv me sum blockchainz""* bullshit...oh yes, the page is cool but they speak bullshit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMEOKDVXlUoOh my god its the flash pages of the 2000's

Please god noAre companies now just calling bitcoin , Blockchain?  i think in the future thats what will happen, everyone will be using blockchain but it will bascially be Bitcoin.This kind of websites makes me nauseous. Literally.TL/DR - Hurr durrr, buzz word salad circle jerking about blockchain with little to no understanding what actually makes a blockchain useful.

This site just reinforces that Goldmansachs doesn't know shit about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or blockchains.Two things:

* for all the money they've invested in the space, they damn well better have a cool looking page (that might be all they even have to show for it)
* this reads like an ICO.[deleted]It's possible the company does know about Bitcoin and realizes the page has a lot of falsities but the webpage is more of a marketing scheme than anything else. The buzzwords aren't what they believe, it's what they think people will believe, the webpage is a product.This is the church adopting the printing press.  

Talk to your financial advisor to see if blockchain is right for you.The part about Bitcoin being limited to 8 transactions a second is embarrassing.Tech companies give away their tools for free; Twitter's Bootstrap, Google's Angular, Facebook's React. We may very well see Goldman Sachs' blockchain, who knows. If of course it meets the same qualifications of being free, fair and open."

2017-07-11 23:45:46;please help me lower my wallet transaction fees (approx 10% on a $100 transaction);"you need to restore your backup seed to another wallet, one that supports custom feeshow many incoming transactions do you have to that address?I guess you can't see the actual inputs to your transaction or the byte size or the actual satoshi/byte fee rate? It sounds like you already spent twice ie. 6 in, 2 out, total 8. That means you should have a max of 4 inputs to your desired tx. So that should be less than approx. 900 bytes. If we use $9 then at $2285 that's .00394 btc or 437 sat/byte. Which, yes, is way too high. 

People are getting txs confirmed quickly for even 30-50 sat/byte now. So given you can't truly set a custom fee I'd suggest you look at moving to Electrum where you can have full control over fees, and use RBF to minimize the fee. 

The real question then is if Jaxx is BIP39 compatible and whether you can either 1) restore your backup seed in Electrum (which does support BIP39 seeds), or 2) export your private keys to import into Electrum for creating a new tx.

Jaxx is built for ease of use, for the ones that don't know all the ins and outs of crypto and how many sat/b a tx costs or what even a satoshi is. We built Jaxx to ensure utilisation without hassle and ensuring diligent transaction time.

To get the fees we're using an industry standard feed from https://bitcoinfees.21.co/
Here's the exact api we're using: https://bitcoinfees.21.co/api/v1/fees/recommended

There are three levels you can set in Jaxx as you know. We use: ""fastestFee"" for Fast ""halfHourFee"" for average and ""hourFee"" for slow

This relieves the user of delays in processing their transaction."

Whether you want to buy bitcoin is up to you. I'd recommend reading through the [Newcomer's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jlop4/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/) to get a better understanding of what it is first, and see if it's something you're interested in.See it as a hedge against keynsian economics towards Austrian schools of thought I think hungryhouse.co.UK accepts bitcoin so does scan.co.UK. mostly its used to gamble (sports betting, casino games) and to speculate on other cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens.Biggest advantage: its cool and gives you something to brag in front of your friends, lol.

2017-08-08 23:56:37;Why should currency be separated from state?;"What a scrambled post.  Organize your thoughts and try again.You can't separate currency from state.  In the future we will just have a different kind of state.Governments who issue their own currencies never fail to inflate that currency. So anyone holding it has less and less purchasing power over time. We've come to just accept that as how money works and governments happily use this ""feature"" to pay off their debts. 

Bitcoin has a capped supply. Holding bitcoin does not innately cause you to lose purchasing power over time. A government cannot raid your bitcoin like they can your bank account. Bitcoin provides a currency/value store with properties that have not been seen in modern economic systems before. Governments, if forced by the will of their people, who operate in bitcoin exclusively would lose the ability to wage unnecessary wars and rack up debt on silly projects. We should aim at taking the currency out of the government's hands because all governments will manipulate ""their"" currency for their own good, but not for the good of ""their"" citizens. Essentially they will always debase the currency. The temptation is just too strong to print money for the purpose of spending more.

The original idea for central banks was to make them independent of the government, but that never works in the long run. The government will always try hard to bend the central bank to its own desires and will ultimately always succeed.

It becomes pretty obvious when you imagine a country where all citizens are free to choose which currency they want to use. A country where there are multiple competing currencies, one of them being gold, another bitcoin, and yet another the dollar or euro.

In fact, that is what governments fear and will always try to prevent by all means necessary. Governments will force everybody to use ""their"" currency and no other, as if they had co-opted the first of the ten biblical commandments. Why, do you think, they do that? Why do they fear competition?We shouldn't. Nor will we. Anybody who thinks Bitcoin is going to replace all national currencies is smoking crack. Bitcoin will flourish as PART of the existing financial system, not in place of it."

2017-08-22 23:38:58;What I think about Bitcoin Forks (Daniel Krawisz);"Eh, it's an okay video on a topic we are all interested in, but there are too many biblical comparisons.  Dealing with gods and deities is a zero sum game, you win it all while the other side loses everything.  However in our world and especially in investing there are many degrees of winning and there is room for many different variations of things.  For example, instead of bitcoin evolving to replace all coins in a survival of the fittest type of fight.   There are many niches where other coins can flourish.  Like bitcoin is a store of value like gold.  Ethereum is smart money that can contractually bind adherents to agreements for profitable ends. 

There doesn't have to be losers for there to be winners.

Bitcoin is a tool worth working, not a magical money machine.If you have an account on coinbase, you have it on GDAX also...Transfer funds there and purchase. Avoid inflated prices at coinbase and no high fee on top...If tou got it at 4400 rate, effective price was likely 4550...Thanks for asking! Been wondering too.Amass.

2017-09-12 23:44:54;Serious question: Is it time to sell now?;"Buy. I'm a huge fan of HODL'ing, however if I was EVEN or up on my BTC, I'd personally sell, and put a large buy order in for my original break even amount.

That being said, if you aren't even or positive on your coins, I'd most certainly hodl. Never sell at a loss.

PS, I have literally no clue WTF I'm talking about.Serious answer: if bitcoin drops in price and never goes back up, then now is the perfect time to sell. If it goes up beyond its current price, then waiting until that point is better.

Anyway, relying on news usually isn't.. reliable. See the [Bitcoin Obituaries](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/) for how well that has turned out so far (bitcoin has died 160 times, and counting).Need to sell all the 2017 bitcoins, to get ready for the 2018 models. Dealers are marking down inventory. Good time to buy.I've decided to HODL most, but play with a small stack; look at it this way, will you feel worse if it goes a lot higher and you miss out, or that you didn't sell some of it? If there is a dip, it may end up being very short-lived. So stick to your guns, have a plan at the beginning, and stick to it. There's nothing worse than saying you're going to hold and then selling near the bottom because emotion got the better of you. At some point the market's gone down too far and it's too risky to sell (remember the 1-day 40% ETH, and ~20% BTC rebound after UASF woes?). Good luck to all the HODLers and risk-takers! [Disclosure, I'm a small fish, so not that much to lose with to begin with or to take risks]This is nothing new at all, Bitcoin has been under a constant barrage of negative news since it started and look where we are today.

> However, there's really no good news on the horizon for crypto's. Is it time to sell, for the time being?

Are you fucking kidding me, there is sooo much good tech and development on the horizon that will massively increase Bitcoin's utility value, just look at stuff like Lightining Network, Schnorr signatures, MAST, Mimblewimble, Zerolink/Tumblebit, etc etc.


""With all due respect sir, I believe this will be our finest hour."">There's just more ~~negative~~ **fake** news than positive.Hard to say, but I'm personally waiting for a more significant drop.If you need the money in the next year, sell. But you never should have bought in the first place if that's true and you just got lucky.

If you don't need the money, HODLSell. Yes, I did. All of it.yesThese are small issues in the grand scheme of things for bitcoin. Sure, the price might slide, but timing the market is a fools game. Many folks here have lost big with this kind of thinking - hence the emphasis on HODLing. Bitcoin is here to stay. It will continue to surprise us - both in a good & bad way. Just HODL.Sell and start a short position!Just the opposite. When it's all bad news, weak hands have already sold resulting in a bottom.  When the news is all good it's the best time to sell since everyone is max invested.Vitalik said *ICOs* may be in a bubble. Statement, in context: *""[I]t would be a mistake to underestimate the value of ICOs or to say that they are a bad thing. ICOs are interesting because they enable monetization for open source projects...what we are seeing lately is that people are taking this idea too far...""* As for the rest: big, established financial reporting media and big investment banking interests overlap far more than many people realize... (Just look, for example, at average analyst stock ratings and price targets. If you believed those, you'd think 95% of stocks will *always* go up, and buy everything from A to Z. (Should go without saying, but, Don't.))Two months ago, bitcoin was at $2,600. Keep that in mind.I should've been more clear. When I said sell, I didn't mean sell permanently. I mean sell now and buy back when prices are lower. Buy low, sell high. Looks like I made the right decision, for the time being.Why do you care about what the ceo of a shitty bank thinks? Yeah bitcoin is a sham you should sell ASAP. In fact you should get out as fast as your can so make sure to price you coin well below market rate so you can be sure someone buys it![Buy the fucking dip you fucking idiot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0akBdQa55b4)

The solution is obviously typhoon turbine genrated electricity and satelite wifi.I visit Puerto Rico once or twice every year, My mother is from there, and most of her side of the family lives on the island, including her mother; my abuela. We were able establish contact with them after some time and everyone seems to have made it through the storm, but the infrastructure on the island has always been quite poor and this recent hurricane absolutely obliterated what was already a fragile system. There's no telling how long the island will be without power for & my abuela is currently relying on a small generator to power her oxygen machine. I've already heard stories of people stealing gas from other peoples cars, which is worrisome, given how loud generators are. Fortunately, she has a dog (that bites) and her neighbor is a police officer. The inhabitants of Puerto Rico are an incredibly resilient people, family and community are integral pillars of their society and I believe most of the people on the island will come together to help each other. That however doesn't permit us to stand idly by and allow them to fend for themselves in this trying time. That's why I'm starting a Bitcoin-based disaster relief effort.

Most on are on record saying as much.  It is really unlikely to happen but if it did, it would be the perfect time for a PoW change.  Miners can't afford that.  Anyone who thinks the majority of hashing power is going to follow Garzik is high as a kite.There are only two things which give Bitcoin an advantage over other altcoins:  
  
1. Development Expertise.  
2. User Count.  
  
So, is the genius idea to alienate the development team and simultaneously split the user base?  
  
Sounds malicious to me....If the miners move, but the price for their fork coin is near zero, then why did they move? Everything is going to work out just fine. This fork is going forward just to get behind us whatever remains of the debate. It's a public sacrifice so we can move on.The fact that you can't find a soul who wants to trade his future 2X coins with your Bitcoins after the hard fork should tell you enough about how successful this fork is going to be.Everybody sane has evaluated that  

> 93% of miners point 100% of mining power at segwit2x  

has a probability hovering around infinitesimal  
Planning for difficulty adjustments, hard forks or other measures is a waste of timeNot many devs will work on Segwit2x. This isn't out of spite or pride or anything like that. It's simply that the very things that inspire them to come back to bitcoin and contribute are the core fundamentals of bitcoin and most if not all devs think Segwit2x is a clear breach of those core fundamentals. 

That's not to say Segwit2x can't win. It can, if the users migrate to it. Consider this though: there are people who believe so hard in bitcoin that they held coins they bought for dust when they hit 10x, 100x, 1000x their initial value. These people probably held because they believe in and are inspired by the very same core fundamentals of bitcoin that drives the developers. 

People who are in this for profit and don't care otherwise might join s2x but I am dubious about the rest. That's a lot of whales waiting to crush the price of your new altcoin.

BCH did not see any of this because BCH was never a threat to bitcoin itself. This time I imagine things will be quite different. 

I could be wrong of course. Perhaps the old timers and whales are all dying for a 2x block size. Why would miners point all their hash at the 2X chain? Signalling just means they ready to support NYA, is does NOT mean the will point 100% of their hash at 2X. There was nothing public in the NYA saying all hash must be pointed at the 2X chain and if there it has been broken with bcash>If the +93% of miners listed on https://coin.dance/blocks all point 100% of mining power at segwit2x

Not going to happen./u/mcmike313 Your right.  Came to the same conclusion sitting here thinking about Segwit2x.  It's going to happen because all of the big  mining pools are signaling for it... that's why bitcoin sucks.

The idea of a decentralized coin (Like the U.S. constitution) is a propagated fantasy.  Reality says with events like this.> will any core member support and continue to make segwit2x better if all the miners switched to segwit2x and core came to a halt?

The simple answer is ""no"". The Chevy Cruz is an application of engineering, but it has a lot of moving parts. It, itself can't be classified as engineering.  
  
Yes, Bitcoin relies heavily on applied mathematics.It's not an either-or. But if I had to pick just one thing then I would say it's computer science. 

But it relies heavily on cryptography, and couldn't function without it.

> Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, and communication science. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)

Bitcoin sought to solve two fundamental problems:

* Double-spending problem
* [Byzantine Generals problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance)

Both were long-standing [computational problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem) solved by Bitcoin. In particular, the Byzantine Generals problem is specific to distributed computing and has to do with developing a mechanism of achieving distributed consensus. Bitcoin invented the blockchain as that consensus mechanism. The blockchain is secured by cryptography, which is backed by mathematical proofs of correctness. (well, mathematical proofs of computational infeasibility, anyway)

Also FYI, computer science is a direct outgrowth of math. But you almost certainly won't find cryptography taught in a math department or ""science"" (in general) department, it will virtually always be in a computer science department. (And computer science isn't about computers, it's about computation: ""Computer science is about computers like astronomy is about telescopes"")Well it relies on very powerful math.  Learn about sha 256 to start.I would think, Applied Computer Science would be most descriptive.It's math not science. This is because algorithms are are a priori constructs. Science is empirical. If bitcoin was discovered by someone digging out of the moon, we'd call it scoenceBitcoin is classified as a meat popsicle.If this is your assignment, shouldn't you be the one answering?No. It's an open source free market software project.

Why do 9 if you do 10?

Does electrum remain installed on USB after reboots?

Using USB thumbdrive is not risk-free though, they can be infected in various ways. Booting from ISO on CD-R would be safer. Good if you like Puppies.

Two things: why use Puppy instead of Debian/Ubuntu/Mint? And, if you install from the tar archive from official site then you don't actually need to install dependencies. It can run standalone because of packages folder included. You may still need any hw wallet or unusual support packages. This allows creating a boot usb stick without even having net access at all for offline wallets (assuming you have the tar archive handy on a usb stick).Or use bitkey.ioElectrum remains after reboot, because we created a savefile.
Strong encryption of savefile is enabled and shown in the video. Plus long password of electrum wallet.
USB is offline (has no internet connection), should be kept physically safe, eg in a safe. You can receive BTC even when this USB is not plugged in. Plug it in only when you need to drain your address (send bitcoins), and that should be rare, at least for addresses you keep there, in a ""cold"" storage. Make a paper-backup of the seed and password, and keep them in safe, 2 locations. Nothing goes online, no way of hacker to ""hack"" a paper or unplugged USB. Only physical stealing would do it.

Puppy is smallest I could find that works, 220MB. Ubuntu, Mint etc take around 1.5 GB.How (in)secure is it if I don't use save file (persistent storage)? Apparently there won't be encryption.

2017-10-24 23:36:59;How bitcoin nd Zerocoin works in my mind;
2017-10-31 23:56:41;Shower thought: When I work for fiat money I'm exchanging finite time for something that's infinite. When I work for BTC I'm exchanging finite time for another finite resource.;"Very revealing, smart.Yes! I actually look at work a lot different now

Soon my BTC will make more than me working full time haha  ** drops mic **Thank you !!  Spot on. This is original thinking out of the box, but when you read it. Plain as day.

Thank you for exercising your human potential - great for all of us and thank for sharing :) Even fiat represents _a portion_ of the total wealth denominated by it. While infinite slices can be added to the pie, there is still a finite _whole_. Your share of it just shrinks over time.To be technically correct, bitcoin could have more than 21 million coins if a consensus was met and it was coded in. 
     
Then again the only reason to do that vs adding another decimal place is to 'help' people get over that weirdness in their brains thinking 1 coin is too expensive.

I look forward to the day when using Satoshis as a common method of talking about how many bitcoins something is/costs makes sense. 180ish Satoshis to the penny means we are not there yet....and that is why I always had a hard time to buy eth....Bitcoin has slowed time down.So just start using Bitwage.co to receive BTC instead of fiat. So you willnot waste more energy and time to exchange that fiat into BTC.Good question. Great question. It really opens the doors to whole lot of other questions. A different way to look at it would be hat yes, you are exchanging your finite time for a potentially limitless resource. But if you take the point of view that the fiat you receive will outlast your lifespan (e.g.  Inheritance) then is it that different?Brilliant!money issuance in a fiat system happens at the expense of everyone else, this is why nobody notices it, I'd call it death by 1000 cuts.That's why my freaking paycheck can't arrive soon enough... I'm considering going for payday loans, just to exchange at a lower price Thats the type of thought I would get when I would be high. Best comparison yet.I cant wait to be paid in btc.... 

I also would like to work for ""bounties"" instead of for an employer

I want to browse bounties that fit my skill set- ""do this thing for X mbtc""

When I complete the bounty the contract is automatically executed and I receive my mbtc for work done without having to rely on a paper contract and having to use courts if its not respected. imagine a world where everyone buy bitcoin to ""work"" lol, who is going to do the real work?Sorry, this doesn't work. For example:

> I have a finite amount of toenail clippings. I should therefore be able to sell them for something that is in finite supply - such as gold.

or conversely

> There is an infinite supply of vegetables - they literally grow in the ground. Therefore I should never have to pay for them.

Nope - finite supply and valuable are not the same thing.

Fiat is not ""infinite"", it's arbitrarily inflatable.At least in the case of the United States dollar, it is absolutely not infinite. 

I am interested to hear how you believe that bitcoin will power a government. "

2017-11-07 23:56:23;anyone ever get their account back from Coinbase when they randomly locked it? (Beware);"Damn. I bought crypto for the first time from Coinbase earlier today, maybe 3 hours ago. No transaction showed in my bank account. The only record of the attempted purchase is in the ""daily limit"", since it went down the amount i tried to exchange. I should mention my account still shows a balance of 0.00BTC , maybe im just impatient
? I think, I have the same conclusion , We can't  get our account back. They must be solving the legal cases first which means they have no resources left for non legal requests! Going Legal is the only option. From all the names in the Reddit Support of Coinbase only 1 Olga is active. Rest all of them inactive since long!Are you in the U.S.?It probably wasn't random. But, that is still no excuse!

Is there anything that may have made them suspious of your account activity?

Sorry for your loss!!!  I would contact them again."
