There's a bounty that I know about if a similar service opens for Litecoin.[deleted]More trolls?For litecoin to grow then users who don't know about bitcoin will have to be introduced to litecoin.

You could SSH to each tower if there just running server versions.  The best and most simple is Debian server CD edition tho Ubuntu server has a lot of fans.  You could do a net install of the basic Debian server to all your towers at once and set up up SSH.  Then just install CPUminer plus any needed packages and use P2Pool if there mining 24/7.  Otherwise go with a PPS pool.

2012-10-10 12:44:06;What hardware to use for LTC mining 300LTC/day?;"Well I was getting ~120 LTC a day using a $50 ATI video card I bought off craigs list (before the mobo on the board took a shit) so I imagine if you had either 1 nice video card or 2 OK ones, you'd be able to gen near 300.

I'd more or less just use the GPU suggestions for BTC here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison

So maybe pickup an ATI 7750 for $100 somewhere and it'd probably get you close anyway. Depends on the difficulty.  The litecoin difficulty goes from 18 to 40 swaying back and forth like twice a week.  With this recent Bitcoin price hike, everyone is bailing litecoin so the difficulty going down means a 300 ltc/d rig is a lot more plausible, but tomorrow it could be a 150 ltc/d rig.

Difficulty goes down, so everyone starts bum-rushing litecoin and the hashrate goes crazy and we catch up to the difficulty changing point much, much faster than normal, and then the difficulty like doubles, then the hashrate does down because no one is making any coins, then it takes a crazy long time for that difficulty to go back down, and once it does, everyone starts mining again.  It's a vicious cycle.

That said, I can do about 200 LTC/d on a low difficulty.  With about 15 Radeon cards, mostly 5870s, and about 4.4 MH/s.  

The past few weeks were pretty stable around 30 difficulty which was nice, but recently things got shakey again."

I think if there was a Blockchain/Blockexplorer for Litecoin that would be a big step forward.I would like to see this too!!! There's a demand for it! Make it happen, people will come :-)
2013-02-04 18:18:55;Good news for litecoin?;"Litecoin would suffer from the exact same problem in terms of block size on disk, and slightly less so with the hard block size limit by having 4X more blocks. Overall, the difference is minimal, both coin will have the same problem.Probably what will happen with both (if Litecoin takes off like Bitcoin) is that you'll start seeing a lower limit on transaction size (ie, the smallest amount that can be sent is .01 or similar).

If this happened to Bitcoin because they started bumping the transaction limit, that would be a help to Litecoin or similar, because then you would need a currency that could handle smaller transactions.

Of course, the amount of harm this would cause Bitcoin depends on the value of it when it starts ""nudging"" that theoretical limit.  If you have sites selling memberships or similar for $5 a month, right now its not a problem.  But if Bitcoin hits $100 per, then .05 would be the cost of such a site, roughly, and if they start having to ""bump the lower limit"" up to keep under the limit or at least eliminate the backlog, then you might be rendering it useless to sites that do small transactions.

But, then again, that could be where Litecoin or similar could move in, and actually semi-complement Bitcoin.

I think this is all in a future that may not happen though.  Even though its increasing in popularity right now, any ""hack"" or sudden loss of coins because someone figures out a way could doom either.[Too bad..](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/17vcnh/im_gathering_common_bitcoin_technical/c89a0zm)"
2013-02-11 04:21:45;Will ASIC Bitcoin mining change the litecoin mining market?;"As GPUs arrive, two major shifts happen:

* Litecoin gets out of the closet.  Everyone that was supporting bitcoin-only looks at litecoin with a new perspective.  

* Litecoin gets a very wide distribution.  The ASIC miners now have a serious window in which they will be setting the bitcoin price.  As more people mine litecoin, some of them will sell immediately, others will hold.  

Remember: 30 months from now the litecoin reward drops.  At $0.08, litecoin is extremely cheap.  Isn't Litecoin using a Memory Hard algorithm?  I'd assume that would greatly reduce the feasibility of using an ASIC rig to mine coins, since you still need to walk through very large sections of memory sequentially.  I'm really hoping it does. I'm starting my LTC mining right now in preparation for it. Once the average Bitcoin miner (a large percent of miners) realizes they're screwed due to asic rigs out there killing their profits they're gonna move on over to LTC causing prices to rise. Get ready.. I could see a lot new miners going into Litecoin, which would increase the difficulty and, despite what others have said, I believe that would significantly increase the LTC price."

2013-03-24 23:34:06;Litecoin as alternative for small transactions?;Fees will probably climb or fall as the actual cost of verification changes.

In short, competition is good. transaction fees are very very minimal... not only that - the fee goes to support the network, so you should really pay the fee if possible.

2013-03-31 18:49:09;Most cost effective LTC mining rig possible?;"7950's are a waste of money IMO.  The most power per $ are from 5850's and 5870's.  Here's my copy pasta from another thread:

Buy the cheapest AMD CPU you can find and just use the OEM HS/F.

Get an MSI 790FX-GD70 off ebay or whatnot for around $80. It is the cheapest mobo with 4x PCI-E 16x slots. You don't need 8GB of memory, 4GB would be good. Scrap the case and case fans, just run the rig without it.

And finally, 5850s and 5870s are the most cost efficient per $. A 5870 will get you ~400MH/s, 5850 is around 325-350. You could get 4x 5870's for the price of one 7970. Get a good PSU if you plan on running 4 cards. I would use a SeaSonic X-1250

That would put you at around $800 with more than double the hash power. However, 5870's suck a lot power so electricity costs should be taken into the equation. But if you're looking for bone cheap hash power, the setup I described cannot be beat.
I am also looking for a similar answer and asked it over at /r/litecoinmining you can still discuss it here but there are more people who mine over there :)You can check out [my build](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoinmining/comments/1b5xq9/sharing_my_budget_build_ask_me_about_it/).from what i have read, the motherboard isn't all that important, as long as the card fit.  The cpu should be atleast single core @ 2GHz or more.  The video cards and power unit seem to be the most important thing.

ESPECIALLY lines 36-47.I just got involved in all this mining business with a new gaming pc mining on a 7950 and I can get between 300-500 k/hs. Have you messed around with the Aggression and such? I'm trying to troubleshoot your problem with very little knowledge lol Try cgminer with basic settings. 5830 has 1120 shaders. Documentation says x4 as TC. Try this:

    cgminer.exe --url=http://litecoinpool.org:9332 --userpass=USERNAME.SLAVENAME:PASSWORD --scrypt -I 12 --thread-concurrency 4480 --verbose -temp-target 65 -temp-cutoff 85 --auto-fan

Then up the Intensity until you get Hardware Errors (--verbose mode needs to be on).
Overclocking is the last thing you do, it does not really help. My 5850's use 20watt more overclocked but only push out a few extra Khash. Not worth the extra heat an power imho. Scrypt (LTC) is memory intensive.We have a farm of 5830s miniing LTC currently, here's the reaper settings we use.

EDIT: used pastebin instead - 5830 settings - http://pastebin.com/aiW9YVir

I'm doing CPU mining with SCryptMinerGUI successfully.As mentioned, GUIMiner-Scrypt is the easiest to use/best for Windows mining. 

Your aggression seems to be set too high for something so small. I'd be turning that down. Generally 13 seems to be a sweet spot between efficiency and usability. 

In my own opinion, I feel it's a bit of a waste of electricity/time setting up on your laptop. Better off waiting for a desktop with an AMD GPU.When you get back from vacation you can join us over at /r/litecoinmining and we can certainly help you get your desktop setup.You just need to play with the values in the conf file. Particularly the thread concurrency, worksize, aggression, and threads per gpu. Considering you have a laptop card you probably want the concurrency at 4800 or less, I believe this is supposed to be a multiple of 64. Try changing the worksize to 128 and turn aggression down to around 16(or less) and increase it until it doesn't work anymore. You can try threads per gpu to 2 or 4, pick whichever works the best.

Also, when the hashing is first starting, pay attention to the device that it mentions. If it is your cpu you will need to change device 0  to device 1

edit: do you have the username and password filled out for your worker? This is different than your actual account on the mining pool, you have to set it up on the website in the account settings somewhere."
2013-04-07 21:01:58;Did switching from SHA256d to scrypt acheive its goal?;It is harder to *parallelize* scrypt than SHA256(SHA256(x)). Nonetheless - there would still be significant cost and power benefits to moving it (as implemented in litecoin) into a dedicated ASIC. It hasn't happened yet purely due to the relatively small market cap + low exchange liquidity of litecoin.Seeing as how PPcoin is consistently getting bombarded with asics, yes.Personally, it seems that the fact that LTC came second, allowed for a fairer and more organized birth. Where as many of the people participating in early bitcoin mining were hoarding, or didn't care enough to even keep track of their wallets.

2013-04-21 23:55:26;Question on Wallets (.dat files);"Alrighty, so the wallet.dat file contains your private key. This private key holds all the information to send transactions from a public address. Your public address is what your Litecoins are sent to. So if your wallet.dat file has your address, then you're safe. If not... There's is a theoretical amount of keys pregenerated just in case you send transactions, but I wouldn't depend on it.

TL;DR:
Wallet.dat has private addresses that hold real addresses. Backup only if making new addresses or sending transactions.

ELI5:
Imagine your Litecoin wallet is a mailbox. Let's say your private key the key to it. You pay for the stamps (transaction fee) to send money. You have a public mailbox (public address) where all the money goes. Everyone can send money to the mailbox. If you have the key to the mailbox, you can pick up the money. If you don't, you can't. So what you have to do is back up the key to the mailbox (aka private key). Your Wallet.dat is just a container for your private keys.You should back up your wallet.dat every time you add a new address to it. So if you started out with wallet.dat that has only one (incoming) address, but later generated a couple more (incoming) addresses, you need to back it up or else risk losing money sent to those new addresses."

2013-04-21 16:59:27;Would a maliciously distributed mining operation be possible?;"There are a number of similar working bitcoin viruses/worms/malware in the wild that does exactly this. No reason for litecoin to be different. AFAIK at least some of them use cgminer, so it would be a simple matter of adding --scrypt in the commandline to mine for litecoins instead of bitcoins.

The only thing I could imagine stopping it would be if the pool admins would be notified and would ban the account. You could always set it up to solo mine though.This is seriously the major issue that litecoin faces if it gains more popularity and value. If litecoin doesn't go to ASIC style mining, where people with specialized hardware take care of the network, then it will become more and more popular to target gamers with trojans added to popular released high end games."
2013-04-21 14:11:34;The Math: Why litecoin is more secure than bitcoin;"You should also take into consideration how much does it cost to perform such an attack on various networks. There is a difference between getting 35% of Bitcoin hashing power, versus getting 35% of Litecoin hashing power.

Other than that, it is an interesting food for thought :).What is the cost and propability of a malicious attacker getting a bunch of CPUs/GPUs (freely available on the market) to attack Litecoin, versus them getting a bunch of FPGAs/ASICs (which have to be custom built)? I believe part of the reason Bitcoin HAD to move to ASIC is because if the miners didn't, someone with bad intentions could have. Isn't Litecoin actually less secure simply due to there being so much cheap Litecoin mining hardware out on the market?stocking up on the lites before they hit Gox/libertybitIs it really common for litecoin sites to wait for 24 confirmations?Awesome write-up. This should be pinned to the sidebarI'm not sure that a ""streak"" actually has much significance here.  For a 51% attack to succeed, it's not about mining a streak of blocks before anyone else.  You just need to create a longer chain.  Lets say you want to reverse a transaction after 6 confirmations.  First you send the transaction, and then begin mining your own private forked chain which contains an alternate version of the transaction that sends the outputs to your own address.  After the 49% (honest nodes) have built their 6 confirmations, the recipient thinks the transfer is safe, and hands over the keys to their Porsche.  At this point, it's 51% likely that your private chain is equal or longer.  If it's not longer, just keep mining.  Since you have more hashing power than the competing chain, you WILL eventually have a longer chain (gambers ruin guarantees this).  Once you have a longer chain, release it into the network and the suddenly the recipient no longer has their coins, they've gone back to the attacker.  The network sees this longer chain and naturally accepts it and begins working on extending it.  The more power you have above 50%, the quicker you will produce a longer chain, but anything over 50% is still guaranteed to succeed given enough time.There are lots of errors in your post. I tried to explain in https://bitcoil.co.il/Doublespend.pdf how double-spending works.

In order to double-spend you don't need to find 6 blocks in a row. While the network is finding the 6 confirmations you're also mining so you'll be less than 6 blocks behind - and even then you don't need to find blocks in the row, you just need to catch up (e.g., if you're 3 blocks behind, you win if you find 2 blocks, the honest network finds another one, then you find 2 more). If you have 51% of the hashrate your chance to successfully double-spend is 100%.

On the other hand, in order to successfully double-spend you need to attempt to double spend. You actually have to commence an attack and there are costs involved. So referring to the chance to obtain a ""streak"" in a given time period is pointless - you have to relate the cost of an attack, its potential gain and its success chance.

Re terminology - a ""51% attack"" (or more accurately a "">50% attack"") refers specifically to when you have majority hashrate and thus guaranteed success. If you have less than 50% it's not a >50% attack, it's just normal hashrate-based double-spending which can either succeed or fail.

Anyway, it's well known that for <50% hashrate, success chance decreases exponentially with confirmations and thus 24 is much more secure than 6. It is also well-known that Litecoin obtains 24 confirmations as fast as Bitcoin obtains 6.You are making the argument that a single trial to attack Litecoin with less than 51% of the hashing power has worse odds of success than a single trial to attack Bitcoin with that same less-than-51% percent 

But that is missing the point.  Why care that your windows are bulletproof if your front door is left wide open?  All that needs to happen is for there to be some attack vectors with a profitable outcome.   

So is there an attack against Litecoin that is cheap enough to perform and results in profit?  

While Litecoin's capacity has been climbing quickly, it still is vulnerable to an attack.   DDoS the Litecoin pools, and with under a $1M of GPUs you can 51% Litecoin.  Maybe even a fraction of that.

Can that get you profit?  If you can trade Litecoins for Bitcoins at Vircurex, BTC-e, etc, through anonymous accounts, the attacker can probably get thousands of bitcoins out of those exchanges before releasing the Litecoin blocks with the double spends.    Will this be profitable?   It depends on whether or not those Litecoins the attacker recovered still have any value after the attack.   But the exchanges definitely will face losses of those thousands of bitcoins.
Bitcoin is actually much more secure because while it has fewer confirmations the difficultly seems to be about 20 times less. So I could take over 51% of the litecoin network at 1/20 the cost. People also generally wait for 10 confirmations for litecoins not 24 as you seem to suggest which makes them equally susceptible. Further if I controlled a ""minor"" 8% of the bitcoin network I could easily own over 50% of the litecoin network for the same cost.Bitcoin-lite (litecoin) has a significantly lower hashrate than bitcoin, making it MAGNITUDES less secure.

IF it had the same hashrate as bitcoin, then its more frequent block generation would make double spend attacks by parties with significantly less than 50% of the total hashrate harder in a given space of time, because the probability of getting a consecutive number of blocks faster than the rest of the network decreases with each additional block discovered in that space of time.

On the other hand, a >50% attack actually becomes EASIER with more frequent blocks, because more of the honest work is lost to latency when block times are shorter.

tl;dr bitcoin-lite is currently much less secure than bitcoin. If it had an equal hashrate to bitcoin, it would be more secure from small double spend attacks from parties with much less than 50% of the hashrate, and less secure from large >50% attacks.

- then, if I remember correctly you need to tell the wallet to go hunt for your coins in the blockchain, I think the command here is:

getaccount litecoinaddress

where litecoinaddress is the public key (the public key can be derived from the private key). The wallet will then scan and add up all your entries related to the public key.

Of course the blockchain should be up to date.

That is unless the price will rise again, but I don't expect that for the near future.I quit mining BTC for about a week after the block reward drop, because mining was like -90% profitable then, & I was focused on short-term only then - but it went back to sustainable levels, so I continued (thank goodness).String of part failures. Just didn't want to spend the money to replace the parts. So this week I dismantled my rig so I can sell whats leftThe whole thing sounds a lot like [Tulip mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania)I have a 5 card setup and thinking of selling all of a suddenly I couldn't mine anymore, just went from 535 ro 5 randomly, with no change in setup.  So gave upStopped for a while but starting again now. :)I've slowed down, but not of my own volition... :( GPU and PSU went belly-up, so I had to send it out to get RMA'ed. Been mining with my old, slow GPU and a bunch of CPU mining just to get something while I'm waiting for my replacement to get here...I haven't quit altogether (have four rigs running), but I have four rigs currently sitting idle, each with 2x7950 (4800kH/s on the shelf). 

I live in a hot climate, so running them this time of year doesn't make sense. As well, my house's circuits have trouble providing for all of them, and electric is fairly expensive at a 3rd tier (my electric company charges more per kWh the more you use) at $0.16/kW hour. I mined for a while, but the hashrate on my tiny Nvidia card is pathetic.  Cryptocoins are just a hobby for me, and I'm not willing to spend the money for a really good GPU.  So for now I'm just buying small quantities of coins and waiting to see what happens.It's hardly profitable now with the drop in LTC/USD price and increasing difficulty.

Should consider quitting now.I started for 2 days but then stopped cause I just don't have confidence in bitcoin anymore.

Bitcoin/Litecoin is an interesting development but its cons overall have outweighed its pros atleast for me.[deleted]It's just not worth anymore to nine with GPU s."

2013-07-05 05:31:16;Are 51% Attacks even a concern anymore?;"The top few pools together are over 51%. If four people decided they wanted to, they could work together and dominate the network.The main protection against this, is that they have more to lose than to gain by doing this. It doesn't matter if you're a few top-10 pools together, or an unknown entity with a lot of hashing power. By performing a 51% attack, you spend so many resources on a double spend, that you're much more likely to have earned more by playing by the rules. If you try to game the network and take all blocks for yourself, you're removing all thrust and probably devaluate the coins mined, and good luck with hiding the coins - it's clear where they're going.

In short, Litecoin is well established, and have a solid userbase, so 51% attack is much less of a concern.https://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,4332.msg30477.html#msg30477
See the calculator.  We are concerned when pools grow above 20%.  We have some guidance here, but it is up to pools if they want to voluntary agree.A double spending attack doesn't require 51% hash power. As the litecoin dev commented, ""We are concerned when pools grow above 20%."" 

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1cssqr/the_math_why_litecoin_is_more_secure_than_bitcoin/) post, though not wholly accurate, might lead you closer to understanding why an attack doesn't require 51%

It was recently announced that the combined computing power hashing the Bitcoin network, is currently the most powerful in the world of anything.  I don't think there are many people out there that have the power to do that anymore, although I'm sure it is still slightly possible.Wouldn't the best protection against this be if everyone went on P2Pool? Because P2Pool is distributed you can't have people that take over the network and you still get regular payouts without everyone going solo mining to take away the power from the pools. I think in the future there will be a symbiotic relationship between XXXXcoin and P2Pool.
Anyone know the downsides of P2Pool other than the dust problem?I don't think a 51% is likely to happen. But if an attacker gained physical or root access to a pool they could set it to do what they wanted. Combined with a DoS of other pools, that could be effective. The moral of the story is; choose your pool (and backup pools) wisely and it's ultimately up to the users (miners) to keep their hashes distributed. A well distributed net is HIGHLY resistant to the attacks I describe. Protip: use a p2pool node as one of your backup pools. Even if cut off from other nodes it'll still solo mine. One of the biggest problems with a 51% attack is motivation. If you have 51% of the power you have a really great incentive to not ruin your mined assets by devaluing them. The attackers have to have tons of mining power and more to gain from ruining litecoin than the $36,000 / day they could gain. Yes."

2013-07-14 16:29:48;What is the point of PCI-E risers?;"The point of risers is to have more space between the cards. You use risers so you can move the cards around a bit because the slots on the motherboard are usually way to close together. The cards will overheat. So you use a riser and then move the cards so that you have the biggest possible space between the cards.

Regarding your second question:

you should use risers on all 5 cards. Otherwise you will get cooling problems. It's very important that you use at least 2 powered risers, I would probably use 5 powered risers to minimize the risk of destroying your motherboards power connector.

edit: Next time, ask such things on /r/LitecoinMining ;)Also, the ability to shove a 16x card into 1x slot by using the appropriate riser allows you to buy a much cheaper motherboard.Everything Type-21 said was correct.  In addition, there are powered risers that provide a 12V line to the card from the power supply.  Some motherboards can't handle that much initial draw when the computer starts, so powered risers help that.But GPUs usually need two slots due to their cooling. To use all PCIe, you need more space, hence the risers.>you should use risers on all 5 cards.

#Does the business in question support bitcoin transactions already?
*like Double Fine, Reddit, Humble Bundle and more do?*

If so, Convincing them about litecoin is slightly easier since they they already trust that cryptocoins can be considered a valid source of payments. Write something about that in your email, Comparisons to bitcoin and such (IDK what you'd write specifically, but just a hint)

Tell them about Payment processors such as Kojn, it's a new one that's still in beta at the moment, but it accepts bitcoin AND litecoin payments, so consumers can use what they have (So for example, if i have bitcoin, and a store only accepts litecoin, i'd have to go to an exchange, and convert to litecoin and vise versa, where as with Kojn, they could accept either)


#If the business doesn't accept Cryptocoins at all:

This is where you'll have to pick around at what to say and how to word things. Most people don't know much about bitcoins, let alone litecoins. some people have a misconception that it's play money and shrug it off as a contender to real fiat. others may be open to new ideas if it's not a ton of work to setup acceptance for these coins.

Look at the various informational material on bitcoin, since it came first, it'll explain the idea and working behind cryptos better (We Use Coins is possibly the most used to describe them)

Tip: Don't get in to too much technical mumbo jumbo. Just as any other form of payment, (Credit, check, cash, paypal) is that money comes in. 

You'll probably mention stuff like it's a new type of payment system, users can pay in litecoin\bitcoin and the businesses will receive fiat money by using payment processors.

Sorry it's not a straight example, but you'll have to play with it to your needs and how you'd want to address the business. Can you more clearly state what you're offering? Do you have an opted-in mailing list? Or do you run websites with significant traffic?"

It will probably cost you around $15 in fees Well, the first thing i'd tell you to do is put that $100 in cash in your bank/credit union so you can access it electronically because you can't buy LTC with cash. lol

There are better options in progress thoughLTCPP is getting ready, which will simplify the whole process. Look also at Kojn. 

BTW, MT-Gox provides a way for merchants to accept BTC, it will do the same for LTC.

Just be patientLook into Litepay or Kojn; if these don't fit your requirements then your next best option is running your own node like you suggest at the moment.

2013-07-27 07:22:52;if Litecoin follows Bitcoin...;"I do not respect these types of posts on any cryptocoin sub. 

First of all, we are not ""right here/there"". What happens with these markets is independent on what has happened with similar markets. I love litecoin as much as the next guy but it's like saying a stock in a tech company will do well because a competitor or similar company has had success within their niche. 

You know what creates that influx of popularity and value? Positive services that support a level of hype. Right now we don't have that momentum.if I can get to the edge of a rainbow...Why the hell will litecoin rise to have a multi billion dollar market cap? We have little to no payment merchants, little to no stores who accept litecoin, the mining environment is still very small (no massive ASIC companies yet), there are no large gambling sites using LTC, no exchanges allowing you to use more advanced trading methods (options).

All we have right now is atlantis, and there are no major signs of this getting picked up to anywhere even close to bitcoins drive. Maybe if bitcoin becomes a large actual full blown currency accepted in many stores, people will also invest in litecoin under the idea it is another cryptocurrency, but even then I doubt it will rise anywhere close to 266 each.

If so, you'd really only be vulnerable to a keylogger, no?I tried the usb booting of lubuntu(luv it) for my first litecoin wallet a few months ago. I ended up using Lubuntu on virtualbox on windows7 as my preferred method. Then, I got scared of losing my coins and could not find good strait info on how to update litecoin wallet on linux so i made a wallet on a new netbook, encrypted it, and used the first sentence of a popular website as my pass phrase(saved the whole page .htm to my desktop) and uploaded it to the cloud. [just my growing experience so far*]> Unfortunately we don't have the equivalent of Armory or Electrum for litecoin yet, so you have to use Litecoin-Qt. This means regular backups after sending transactions. Oh well.

Care to explain? I have a 8Gb and a 32Gb USB drive and if we install Lubuntu to an USB drive, do we have to follow Step 2 everytime we boot Linux or Everything that I've done is saved onto the USB? 

Can I save the backup wallet that I save to on the same USB that I use to install Linux or should I just save the file to a seperate, secured ecrpyted USB drive or just use dropbox?

> That's it! If you already have litecoins somewhere else, test the system by sending a small amount (0.1 LTC) and making sure it works, then you can transfer the rest.

If a small town started using Yen instead of dollars, do the feds have the power to step in and regulate?

I'm confused on the whole matter.The only way to ""regulate"" bitcoin is to 51% the network and I didn't see anything about that in this article.  There's nothing stopping a wealthy power from doing this with ASIC's and that's one of the reasons that I like LTC.  It would take much more to ""regulate"" LTC than BTC.Good luck with that. I think people are misusing or misunderstanding the concept of ""regulation"". All that this means in this case is that Bitcoin will be treated as a REAL currency. Meaning it will be a true investment vehicle and the US will acknowledge that it carries value.

Last thing we need is more people getting scammed by them. 
THanks.Neither SHA-256 nor Scrypt are ciphers (encryption algorithms).

Routers might use SHA-256 to derive their keys from passphrases of arbitrary length, but the traffic itself is protected by a cipher like RC4 or hopefully AES.

Additionally, neither the bitcoin nor litecoin protocols use encryption.  Encryption is just one facet of cryptography.  Digital signatures and cryptographic hash functions are the crypto of cryptocurrencies.Not bad!

If I might share my opinion on a couple things.  First, the information seems completed but I don't think I heard anywhere the difference in confirmation times between BTC and LTC. Seems important but I might have missed it if you mentioned it.  Second, and this is just personal preference, but a slide show video is kinda boring.  When videos are animated with simple graphs and cartoon images, they seem to be easier for the viewer to understand (at least for me).  And last, I'd suggest pulling out anything with your opinion and just leave the facts.  If it's meant to inform, you don't want someone to accidentally confuse your opinion with a fact and end up possibly spreading incorrect information.

2013-08-25 01:15:43;Litecoin's future;"[deleted]I think the biggest thing currently is getting litecoins economy rolling. 

There are a lot of posts about convincing places to accept litecoin, but that is very difficult for most businesses without any crypto payment processors or exchange APIs allowing for LTC/USD payments. Businesses can adopt bitpay because it works similarly to amazon payments or PayPal handling customer payment, and the site is sent USD at the end of the transaction. Unless they are actively involved with the cryptocurrency scene, they aren't going to want to accept raw cryptocoins as payment may they be btc or ltc. 

Until either an existing service like bitpay adopts ltc or a large exchange adopts ltc and rolls it into their api, litecoin will never see much growth. 

That should be the community's biggest goal and concern, at least in my opinion. What good is a currency that cannot be spent easily?yes everyone pleae give up on LTC so I can buy all your cheap LTC before the market catches up - sell sell sell Threw in my two cents... 

This is a very thoughtful post by Otexpreneu and I certainly understand all of the concerns raised. One theme in this thread is that the software, or some extra features in it, or even that a well known developer or organizer will make all the difference in Litecoin's future. Litecoin is solid. It has survived numerous attacks but lives in strength against the odds. Part of the reason for this longevity is because it IS so similar to Bitcoin. I'm not sure people generally appreciate how well Bitcoin's parameters were chosen. The ""minor tweaks"" in Litecoin were similarly well chosen and coblee really doesn't get enough credit for the restraint he showed in developing Litecoin. 

[The rest of it...](https://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,5567.msg42449.html#msg42449)I know it adds a huge overhead and all that -- but adding a zerocoin functionality, or something similarly game-changing would really put LTC ahead.  It's currently on a course to stagnate at the moment, ASICs are already starting to become unprofitable so the sha256 vs scrypt argument (the only real difference) is starting to lose traction.If litecoin wants to take off, it needs to offer something that none of the others do.  Surely there's someone out there with so many litecoins that its makes sense for him to invest something game-changing.  What about getting a major American bank to offer online conversion to/from LTC?  Or get LTC listed on a major stock exchange?

Best would be to get a major online retailer to accept LTC.  Amazon, ebay, even paypal.Did we ever figure out who the anonymous matching donor was a couple of months ago who pledged all of the LTC to the dev team? ... Generally speaking, who is invested in LTC's future?We should use one coin just like we all speak the same language. 

I don't think it needs to be binary.  "

Coinbase seems popular for buying Bitcoin if you're American.It's not really efficient to mine with an nVidia card because the way the architecture is set up.

Beautiful!

So I'm continuing that and setting up a website, and taking the necessary steps to open up my album for release on Litecoin, Bitcoin, and for USD. Unfortunately the USD release will involve a lot more work to make happen (another reason why LTC/BTC rule and will always [have a place in my heart](http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking.html)). If you believe in my mission, you can donate to help me keep my studio and finish production: LhswQ6Z7vbqEq5hwRDK4xjUdQjFm7MUKgJ (mirrored in track title for verification). 

I believe Litecoin can be as big as Bitcoin, it just needs more successful examples of people accepting it to broaden its network/exposure! As long as it is only used for speculation, it will lose its value.

* Why should I implement Litecoin if I already accept Bitcoin?

followed perhaps by:

* Isn't Bitcoin more well known?

* Won't it be confusing for my customers adding a second cryptocurrency when most people barely understand one?

* Won't adding Litecoin dilute or cannibalize my already low Bitcoin sales?


Great! i think it's easy to agree with the diversification points, so these are the best points to push forward IMO.

BTC might be the most important blockchain right now but many things can happen as it gets older... especially malicious organizations with enough resources to mount an attack that can effectively destroy the network can arise, LTC guarantees that the same hardware used for a BTC attack cannot be used against LTC so that organization will need double the resources to attack both networks... etc.

 We have thought about litecoin and want do it in the future.Â  The main reason we don't is that we are swamped with all the things we are doing right now.Â  Even if we can catch up on things in our hectic schedule, there are a few more things we want to learn and do with bitcoin, and we want to improve our website (particularly the shopping cart) before we take on another crypto-currency.

2013-09-14 20:26:33;Is it worth getting into mining?;"The biggest thing is how much you pay for electricity. If it's cheep then maybe.The more miners there are fewer coins are distributed per miner. So its sort of an anti-circlejerk to keep as few people interested as possible. The bottom line is if mining where not profitable, the price of the coin would raise and/or the less patient miners will drop out and lower the difficulty.Everyone who is mining will tell you not to mine, and everyone who isn't will tell you that you should.

Something to think about.Mining is hard work- I can't stress that enough.  

The initial setup will be brutal, then nothing - until something goes wrong.  When that time comes up, it will be insane the level of work required of you.  
I love mining, and think that everyone ought to.  Don't think it'll be a cake walk and you'll be fine.  I can't answer to doing this for the purpose of making money. However, I'm mining as a hobby and if you're just looking to do this for fun, I'd definitely go for it. As I like to say, some people like spending tons of money on their cars. I prefer spending my money on computers.No we have an entire subreddit for a completely worthless venture... Back to the front page for you!!!  :P

But, depends on what you want to do.  I personally didnt have a ton of $$ to put up for it, so I use my gaming PC to mine when Im not using it and I have a 7850 in my kids PC when its free.  Between the two I get about 650 khash and comes to .5 to .7 coins a day .  But I live in Idaho, USA so my power is about .07$kwh which makes it profitable, however pretty slow.    

Those guys with 5+ GPUS mine about 5-8x faster then me, but they have an investment at least of $1300+(prolly more) and still have power to pay. 

Currently the coins are right around $2.50, but most miners are holding their breath hoping they get added to some big exchanges and the price will jump, possibly up to $20+.  Again this is all speculation and its possible they become worthless or illegal..I got into mining because I had lots of hardware lying around so the inital investment was lower without that it would have been much higherIf you want to get Bitcoins then get ASIC miners, GPUs are not really that profitable anymore. I set up 2 7850's 5 months ago. I am netting about 0.27 USD a day after electric. I just let them run anyhow, they have paid for themselves over the past 5 months but unless the value of LTC increases, mining is, and will continue to be a lost cause. MT Gox was supposed to start exchanging LTC but it does not look like they ever will at this point.One way to ""get into mining""  would be to buy into a mining bond or stock on litecoinglobal.com.
Obviously it isn't the same thing as doing it yourself ,  but it's a way a decent way to see the benefits without all the same risk and effort... Plug in your numbers [here](http://ltc.kattare.com/calc.php). 

If you're looking at a 6 GPU  (3900khps, 1500W, 12 cents) then  you'll get about $2,000 after a year after you pay your power bill.  That will probably pay off your rig and give you a few hundred to spare (that's a bit idealistic because you still might lose money if Litecoin interest continues to stagnate or the price move against you).  If you spent 40 hours (totally reasonable, I won't admit to how much time I've spent) then you're making less than minimum wage.  

To frame it a bit negatively, do you want to risk $1500 to get minimum wage returns?Not worth mining, its just too much effort and most likely not profitable unles your electricity is free.

Just buy coins periodically instead.Short answer: nope.

Long answer: noooooooooooooooooooooooooope.

Seriously though: It's only worth it if you are willing to invest $$$ in hardware, in the order of several thousands at least. If that's not a deterrent to you, you might want to ask at /r/litecoinmining for further tips."

Because Litecoin and Bitcoin are not fully understood, it's easy for a credit card company to void the charge, especially because no physical goods or services were exchanged.which country are you in?Payoneer has a system in place to transfer funds between their cards. Maybe buy btc via https://www.btcquick.com/ & then trade those for ltc via an exchange like https://www.cryptsy.com/?  This is assuming  your debit card can also be used like a credit card.  (this is also assuming you're willing to pay the extra fees for this)

Of course if you have a debit card that means you have a bank account, maybe it would be easier to link your bank account to Coinbase/CampBX/Dwolla, buy btc there, then trade those btc for ltc?  (this is assuming you're in the U.S., you haven't specified country..)"
2013-09-27 22:59:39;questions about kojn-app.com;"My guess is that they aren't a scam, just poorly organized and with a horrible taste for choosing domains.

There's also this one (not much better): coinpayments.netHey there. I'm Kane,helping with the Kojn-App guys directly on their UI and branding. 

/u/animazing is the gentleman running the show here to my best knowledge. He's incredibly genuine and is even a heavy contributor on the Electrum wallet. http://electrum.org/community.html

I'm not in a place or position to inform the public on anything besides the fact that I'm working hard on bringing a fresh and trustworthy aesthetic to the Kojn system. 

Hopefully /u/animazing will chime in more since this is his baby. I will however state that this is a service where you either win the community's trust or be tainted with a bad name, so upon release it has to be good! Hey there,

As Kane mentioned I'm one of the people behind Kojn. 

Your criticism is valid; the website does not have all the documents in English yet and the design leaves some to be desired. I think it's time I explain a couple of things of our origin. 

Originally we were going to focus on our local market and design Bitcoin payment solutions for Dutch companies. Kojn would be one of the services we would offer. During the development process we were annoyed that there was no good solution for Litecoin payments so we decided to make our engine support multi-currencies and tell people about it.

In hindsight this might have been a mistake. Our primary focus is still developing for our local market but because of the Litecoin thing we got also got to deal with all these i18n customers all of a sudden. Because of regulatory restrictions we can't do fiat conversions for customers outside of the Netherlands so we can't offer the prefect package yet and it's not on the shortlist to expand any time soon. 

A lot of things will change in the coming months. We are getting ready to switch to an other exchange that will offer us better turn-around time for our fiat conversions; but again for now that's just our local market. 
We will hopefully switch to the new Bitcoin payment process making our implementation much easier, I only hope that Litecoin will keep up with this development. A proper redesign is also in the cards.

In the end we were just trying to do a nice thing for Litecoin that backfired on us. I hope this provides some insight.

2013-10-06 23:46:06;What Is Wrong With Litecoin?;"Couple of complaints:

>Litecoinâs money supply will reach 84 millions coins, whereas Bitcoinâs money supply will reach 21 million coins. Roughly, this puts Litecoin at 1/4th of Bitcoinâs value, which we havenât seen come to realization yet.

The above quote is a non sequitur. To demonstrate... I hereby create OneCoin. Only one is ever going to be made, and I have it. Roughly, this puts OneCoin at ~21 million times Bitcoin's value, which we haven't seen come to realization yet.

Silly.

>Litecoin was originally designed to be **complimentary** to Bitcoin, not replace it by any means. Which it does very well. 

The word they are looking for is compl**e**mentary. Minor distinction, but just like ""to/too"" and ""then/than"", this is one of those minor grammatical distinctions that (to me) undermines the credibility of the author significantly.

Other than that, not a bad article.(1). My first thought is why would you think LTC benefits from BTC bad press? Cryptos are all in this together. You might be thinking about if BTC had some serious issues everyone would move to LTC and it take off(not the case here). (2). All of this bad press is not bad press it's good press.> the Litecoin block reward still has 50 LTC per block. This should, in theory, make it more attractive to mine Litecoin over Bitcoin

No it doesn't. The coins produced per block is only relevant when also considering the value of those coins.

There was some daft altcoin called infinite coin that churned out something like 100,000 coins a block. That didn't make it more attractive to mine.Article should be titled ""Introduction to Litecoin"" and then remove the one or two sentences that don't fit. Boourns... I was hoping for some actual insight since the decline in value that's stuck since the Silk Road bust.As a strong supporter for LTC, I've actually cashed out all my holdings due to losing faith in it.

I think at this point, people have relied too much on the ""Gox hype"", and that has hindered it massively. Where it goes from here I think is unknown, especially when other currencies (such as PPC) are being pumped left right and center.

I'd love for LTC to take shape and to be the 10-15% of BTC we all want, but realistically I think we've missed the boat for it."

2013-10-05 08:54:45;Lost my litecoin wallet passphrase;"If there was anything you could do then there would be no point in a pass phrase existing in the first place.> I'm fucked ?

yessetup a new wallet ill send you 15 LTC you sir are fucked.well at $30 worth of litecoin you could have had a worse day. This is why I would recommend people not use a pass phrase at all, and instead keep thier wallet on a secure USB drive somewhere or at the very least have their wallet passphrase somewhere repeated in three different spots you can get to IRL to look up the password.I've lost about 70ltc due to this. Its one of the reasons why the first bit coin clients had no passphrase support, it was by design because you are MUCH more likely to lose your password than get your coins stolen. Eventually they put it in because of pressure and lo and behold? People lose more money permanently from losing their passphrase than they ever would if stolen.ESPECIALLY don't do the shit the litcoin client says you should do for a password (something like 7-8 unrelated words or 15-20 random characters). THIS IS AWFUL PASSWORD DESIGN! The best passwords are short, simple, unique and easy to remember. If you do what the litecoin client says, you will forget your password or at the very least have to look it up every time. It's actually easier to crack a totally nonsense random password (yet impossible for people to remember) than just doing a simple password consisting of word association and is at least 8-12 characters long that is impossible to forget. Just don't make your password obvious to other humans and you'll never lose it. Actually screw all that. Best way to protect your wallet is to name it into some bullshit file and file type and put it on several different obvious locations (root drive, USB, etc). When you need to use it just move it back to the normal litecoin folder and rename to wallet.dat . No password to forget, and you are unlikely to seriously have it deleted or stolen or lost forever.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a39wwLKXUnYIf you know approximately what your passphrase is (how many characters, starts with, what type of characters), you can bruteforce it with a Python script. Let me know if you need help with that.Like this guy I have a passphrase problem. I created a 12 character random one using letters, numbers and special characters, and carefully wrote it down. When I came to transfer some coin I realised I wrote down only 11 rather than 12 characters and can't work out what is missing.  What an idiot!

I am guessing that to quote plopingo ""I'm fucked"".

2013-10-13 15:22:23;How profitable is mining litecoin?;"The way I am looking at it now is the same way I looked at btc when I mined it in 2011. In 2011 I mined 6 BTC over the course of a few months just for fun I found it interesting that running my computer while I slept meant I could make $0.50 a day! lmfao. Anyways I gave up the mining operation when btc crashed from $40. Gambled away some of my BTC because at this time it is now basically useless after gox was hacked. left 8btc sitting on a old hardrive after I upgraded to a SSD. Well a few years later I read the headlines BTC 100$ well I raced home and booted up that old HDD sure enough my coins were still there.

This is what I personally believe will happen with LTC. Yea it might be a waste of time making $0.50 a day now. But who knows what 2 years from now will bring!. At least now we have something to base it off of and not just the unknown :DThese days, not really. I'm roughly breaking even and I have cheap power. If you have faith in the future of LTC, could be a good deal. Or, it could be a waste of money. Its Not profitable for most people, in fact alot of miners have been closing up shop lately especially with the price drop, which would explain the difficulty stabilizing somewhat.Currently, not very unless you have free power and already own one or more decent GPUs. However the difficulty seems to have dropped a bit lately but I suppose it will rise again soon..Depends.

Do you need to buy and/or pay for any high end GPUs to mine with?

Do you get free electricity?

If you answered yes to either question then no, LTC mining isn't profitable.  In theory if you have free electricity you *could* make ROI on the GPUs eventually, maybe within 1.5 years or so?  (assuming no changes in difficulty!)

Doesn't mean you can't mine, just don't expect some kind of ROI ;)I tried mining litecoin, but in the long run is definitely more convenient to invest some BTC and actually buy LTC. At least that's what I didAs others have pointed out, buying the LTC directly might be a better option. IMO you should mine scrypt if you have GPUs kicking around or can get em (and the power to run them) cheap. Also, you have to enjoy keeping your machine(s) running. What is your time worth? You're better off buying the coins with your fiat in the long run."

Then implement some Web GL to get some of the animations running on my GPU, or remove those animations entirely as they really aren't necessary.

The developer has committed one of the great sins of gaming: creating a game so focused on its graphics that they get in the way.Wow, 26,565 ltc wagered on dicenow ltc 1% yesterday, $62,700 on that edge alone, site has just been translated in to Chinese, seems to be taking off!"

Also, as to your question about adoption, nobody really knows. It could either rise greatly, stay around the same or go down in price. Your guess is as good as mine. Only time will tell, I guess. But the general consensus is that the price is going to rise along with adoption.You need to say something a little more substantial than XPM is more attractive, is there any reasoning there or is this all off the cuff.  

Also why is there burden on us to convince you to go long?  Overall you left a bad taste in my mouth with this post.LTC on Gox is less meaningful than it would have been 3-6 months ago. Would rather see LTC come to BTC-China, BitStamp or Coinbase. Don't get me wrong, LTC on Gox would be great but they've become less relevant over time.Can anyone guess why Gox has said many times that Litecoin was coming specific dates (and, obviously, failed to deliver)? Have they just been trying to stay relevant? Did bigger issues/problems (legal, trade engine, etc.) take precedence over Litecoin?

Don't forget that CoinMKT.com trades many altcoinsâ¦ If only they had some volume.Litecoin is superior to XPM in many ways. Scrypt mining, second biggest network already and it's used as a testing ground for bitcoin development. Our new developer warren is doing great things just now. "

Otherwise, just use your debit card at an ATM to withdraw cash, then buy from someone on Localbitcoins or bitquick.co.

re: LTC, I like Cryptsy for buying LTC but there's a few other exchanges for that as well.i accept postal money order by mail and they usually accept debit cards. also, i believe moneygram allows you to use debit cards also.It occurred to me, you could *maybe* check out https://www.coinmama.com/, if your debit card/bank account is already linked to Google Wallet that might be an option.

2013-11-10 20:18:34;looking to setup an accessible LTC exchange.;"Im lurking too.... Love the safe and easy was coinbase does things@ Zipzo 

Safety is always good and should always remain a priority.. But ease of use, also has to be a priority. An average person is not going to jump through 10 hoops in order to acquire something unless they are extremely motivated to do so. 

I'm trying to bring a simple solution to the table, that will offer the average joe that simple transfer Cash into LTC.. The most important aspect is simplicity. 

Eobot will withdraw the currency you already have into a transaction. Can't purchase it directly. 

Like I've said in the OP.. This has a huge amount of potential, in order to achieve it, it has to be accessible. (Accessible meaning, easy way to get it -- We don't have to write guides about how to get lite coins or buy this one then transfer then do this and do that.. Most regular people won't do that unless they have a high motivation to do so.) There is nothing motivating right now, because the biggest question is.. What Can I do with Lite coins?! 

Unless we can first make it easy for people to get them, then diversify different ways of use. This is my opinion. [deleted]BTC-e.com

you can buy litecoins, bitcoins, peercoins, namecoins and the like on there
Like everyone else here.. I just want Litecoin to be worth its true value. There is lots of exchanges.. and there is also lots of Crypto coins. I think that in its all my personal opinion. That their should be an alternative to BTC and LTC is the front runner for that.. I see a problem maybe exchange is not the right approach.. There is got to be a way to make the currency easier to acquire. I'm looking to invigorate minds in this community so we can say come together and toss ideas. It will be beneficial for everyone to see its value rise and in order to do that we need certain edges to come up with ways to make it safe -- easy to get.. 

So the biggest problem in terms of using a service is that most CC transactions afraid of either someone using a stolen CC to purchase this coins with, and money laundering. Maybe someone knows a system like Skrill (using them as example) that can be used a form of payment processing that can be incorporated into an easier cash of not just USD, but other national currency that can be used to help with the exchange. That is safe at least on their end. 

I believe that if the exchange is easy and effortless then an average person will have more incentive to get LTC's.  

Doesn't Eobot solve this?"

2013-12-01 23:20:33;To anyone considering buying GPUs for mining / building a rig;"[deleted]I recently purchased a new mining rig (3 7950's, etc). When I did my calculations, I did it based on a difficulty of 4000 and an LTC price of $18, which seemed reasonable for where we were then. It's quite possible difficulty will spike much higher though.

That said, this is a long term experiment for me. Loosing the money I put into mining will have no real effect on my life and family, so I have no need to get the money back any time soon. Rather, I prefer to take a long view and have fun building the hardware, and perhaps it will turn out extremely profitable one day. Had I held on to the bitcoins I mined when they were $1 each (I didn't bother to keep the wallet), it would have been extremely profitable. And while I'm not expecting that of litecoin, there's something about watching a machine spit the things out that's quite appealing to me. 

Anyway, I guess my point is don't get into it for some kind of get rich quick scheme; those never work out. Rather, treat it as a highly risky investment that IF you happen to enjoy, pays for itself regardless of the profit. 

when I started mining LTC 8 months ago I was told the exact same concerns.  Same thing started when I started mining BTC 3 years ago. 

Decide today that LTC will be worth $1000 a piece and no matter how much your mining gear costs today, it will be worth it.As a complete noob to this, I wanna throw my two cents in.

In my mind, mining is for the long haul, period. It is also not something that I fund with money needed for life as we know it. It is a nerdy hobby that just might one day become insanely profitable. It also could end up being worth naught.

Because of that last sentence, no one should go ""all in"" on any of these cryptocurrencys as they are all at any point subject to a possible crash.

For me, I did a ton of research. I was first tipped off about Bitcoins, Before I bought or did anything with my machine, I read and read. I quickly realized that Bitcoin was not even remotely possible and I of course found out about it at the wrong time.

Enter the Litecoin (just wanted to say that). Now here was something I might be able to do. Again though, I read and read. Hardware, (which appeals to the nerd in me), configurations, hashrates, power consumption, all that nerdy shit.

However, I also spent some time finding out about Litecoins, When doing the research on Litecoins, of course you find out about all the other altcoins out there and then it seems less appealing. But in doing that research you realize that Litecoin is the clear choice for the next type of accepted crypto currency.

That in itself has enough of an intrinsic value to go ahead and gamble. But its not a straight up game of chance, it is more of an educated guess. If you look at the charts, and notice all of the similarities between Bitcoin and Litecoin at their respective stages of development, it is if I am getting in on Litecoin at the time I should of got into Bitcoin

I'm a gamer, and a little bit of a hardware nerd, so I already had everything but a card. I started with CPU mining just to get the hang of it, setup minerd and just get it working. 

Once I saw it was fairly easy to do, I went ahead and started looking for a cheap card used that had a decent hashrate. I settled on a 5850. (Mind you, this is at the time that Litecoin was worth 3 bucks) I saw one listed on Ebay, and when it was listed new, the owner wanted 50 bucks for it, I put a test bid of 59.99 just to see how high it would go, and wouldn't ya know I friggen won the card.

So now CPU mining is done, and I am cruzing along at 400kh/s. I've ""pocketed"" 4 Litecoins so far, and at current value, I have already doubled my investment.

But I wouldn't care if it was still worth 3 bucks. I have already decided that I just wanna pack some of these things away so that if I am truly getting in on Litecoin when I should of gotten in on Bitcoin, I'll be able to cash in.

I also just had a Dell poweredge 2900 donated to me, so I slapped a copy of Windows7 on it, and now am hunting for a higher output card. 

If you are mining, go ahead and forget about the trollbox and all this crazyness of the recent price fluctuation, keep calm, and hold your Litecoin. 

Also, happy mining.Also don't forget that the added demand for GPUs has driven up the price as well.

AMD 7950s were going for ~$200 less than a month ago (check ebay's sold listings). There is now a premium on them and some are going for $350+
I am really curious to see where difficulty ends after this. During the last LTC boom you could still find 7950s if you looked hard enough or were willing to pay more. Now they are completely sold out which makes me think by the end of this week we are going to see a huge jump once everyone comes online. I would not be surprised if we see difficutly hit 2400 this week and 3000 by end of year. If that were the case you would be making roughly 1/3 the LTC you were making prior to a few weeks ago. 

 If that happens we are going to need to see ~$10 LTC to stay profitable and make ROIYes, you should always do your due diligence.

For starters, if you want to mine you should look at a litecoin mining calculator such as this: http://www.litecoinminingcalculator.com/

Then you should look at the type of hardware out there, what it is capable of hashing at: https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparisonâ

When looking at potential hardware you need to factor in electricity costs, pool uptime, pool fees (up to 5% at some such as Coinotron) and of course difficulty rating.

So yes, optimistically if you bought a new 2-4 GPU 7950 rig this moment and it was all set up to go within the next 24 hours, you could conceivably pay it off at current prices (~$32) in a month or so.  But once you add in other costs/fees/delays (sometimes stratum gets knocked offline), it could take a few more months.I know we are in the LTC subreddit, but what do you guys think about Worldcoin mining atm?Very good mention of the hash rate increase, your maths work out and those considering full returns in a month might be caught out. It's a long haul thing, so be prepared for running costs.

Edit: This is the curve you'd get based on mining with a projected 8% difficulty increase every 3 days, close to a plateau at the end of 3 months. http://i.imgur.com/PWcAmnw.png (days at the bottom, LTC on the side, based on a hash rate of 2,800KH/s)Yeah people don't get into mining.  Seriously don't, it's a huge gamble.

It also helps keep the block difficulty lower.

;-) Mining is less risky IMHO than outright purchases of coins. You can either return the equipment or sell it off if the prices crash or difficulty is too high. You can also mine brand new coins which can be sold at a profit upon their initial listings on exchanges. This is a special case where mining is the only way to get coins and prices are artificially high.

If the price crashes and you purchased LTC on a peak you will just have to wait for price to recover.

On the flip side I think if you want to really make money speculating you need to buy coins. Mining will not get you the qty of coins you need to make big gains. For whatever it's worth, everyone I knew told me investing so much in BTC mining last year was a bad idea. After mining with a few GPU boxes, I eventually got a few friends to jump in and we all had rigs running. 

Earlier this year we switched over to LTC and needless to say we've made well over what we put in at this point :)Why would you assume miners will sell at loss? You don't respect the supply side of the market or you don't know how to set an limit order in exchange to only sell while you gain?Don't forget that if things start to get bad, you can sell your gear.  Anything bought within the past 2 years will fetch at least 50% of what you paid for it.  Anything bought within the past few months will sell for at least 80% of what you paid for it.

This, compared to ASICs for Bitcoin, is a relatively safe investment when you look at it this way.  Things get shitty?  Sell your stuff.  You might lose a few hundred dollars max.I've been on the fence the past few days, and heres my logic for why I am getting 3 R9 270X's:

I have almost everything I need for this rig.  I have an old C2D rig waiting for a purpose, and a PSU that can sustain the 3 270Xs.  The cost I would put in is ~$600, and I have no reoccurring costs to add to that (yay free power, thanks overpriced apartment) and I've done the math on numbers.

When I add in my current card that hashes at 470khash/s, I should be getting at worst 1600khash/s.  With it at 1600, at a difficulty of 2400 (trying to guess worst case for the next month or two) I'l be making just under 20 coins/month.  If the price is around $20 a coin (again, going conservative), It'll take me a month and a half.  I am planning on looking at this over the long haul though, if it takes 6 - 9 months to break even, so be it.

Should my calculations be wrong, I can just sell the cards and minimize my losses.  Having hard assets is an easier risk for me to stomach.  If I didn't have a rig to dedicate to mining or free electricity, I would feel more hesitant about investing in mining.For me, I leave my machine on 24/7. so its worth it to mine when I'm not playing games. Though I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my coins yet. I am interested in using them at a local store. but there is only one coffee shop in my city that accepts them. and Its a bit of a drive.

Honestly I'll probably hold my coins and see where we end up. But I like to think of them more than a item I can convert to USD... i want to spend the litecoins themselves.So youre saying go all out to try and reach the goals in the first monthWhat the OP said is true but only in regard to LTC. But you can always find other coins that are still profitable to mine even if LTC diff is going up and price is getting down. Using mining pools that are mining the most profitable coin  (hascow.ws, middlecoin.com or multipool.in) can still help you getting your ROI close to your initial calculations. And also take in consideration another fact. By the time you make your ROI you also have a profit. The GPUs themselves have market value and you can sell them anytime (that's the main difference between GPU mining and ASIC mining)."

The best you could do is get a credit card or debit card that instantly checks the market rate and converts it into USD for usage with a regular gateway like VISA, Mastercard, etc.

This wouldn't work with typical litecoin wallets as it'd require a service that could hold your currency, know the rate on the market, and withdraw the correct amount of LTC against USD when you make a transaction, plus what I assume would be a minor fee for exchange. Think like using your credit card for FOREX to get euros, poiunds, etc.

It actually is not hard at all, but requires legal things and perhaps backing with a credit union to provide the protection a bank using this card would wantOKPAY offers this.I like it, could be very convenient for all stores and consumers.

2013-12-22 16:57:58;You've been duped. OKcoin, the Chinese exchange that helped take LTC from $2 to $48, has more than likely been faking its trading data.;"Can it do it again, please?Chinese involved in smoke and mirrors nonsense? You don't say.OP, I'm not really sure what you are getting at.  When volumes are high for any stock, fiat currency, or digital currency, it does not mean a thing about where the price is going. 

Of course we all like to see prices up on high volume, but I am pretty skeptical that people started throwing huge amounts of money at LTC because they saw high volume somewhere. 

 
Sensationalist title much?

Many things took Litecoin up to $48.Before anyone makes any rash decisions realize that there *could* be a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.

If it turns out that this exchange really was manipulating the market, I find it encouraging that they were found out so easily.I can see how they might inflate the volume data to make themselves look bigger and attract more liquidity but that is not the same thing as manipulating price...  Real buyers took LTC to $48.OKCoin, once the second largest mainland China-based bitcoin exchange (after BTC China) according to volume, has been accused of faking its trading volume data.

The website stopped taking new deposits in the aftermath of the Chinese central bank implementing a ban disallowing banks and third-party payment services from working with bitcoin exchanges, leaving traders temporarily unable to charge their fiat currency accounts or cash out on some exchanges.

**In the days following rumours of the ban, while traders panic-sold their bitcoin holdings and would-be buyers were barred from making deposits into their accounts, many were surprised to find that the trading volume on OKCoin remained unrealistically high.**

The exchange rates, despite plunging, maintained levels on a par with other exchanges such as Huobi.com, which circumvented the ban by allowing traders to charge their accounts by transferring money to its CEOâs personal bank account.

The concern was first raised by someone under the pseudonym Shi Diaomao, a self-proclaimed bitcoin arbitrageur who makes profit by buying and selling BTC on different platforms to exploit the exchange rate gap.

**âShi concluded that the real transaction volume could be as low as one tenth of what the company purported to exchange.â**

In his article posted on 20th December on Xueqiu, one of Chinaâs most popular investorsâ social media platforms, Shi claims that in a two-hour period on 19th December, OKCoinâs data indicates that over 30,000 BTC changed hands.

However, by comparing the number with the tally of selling and buying orders that were displayed separately, Shi concluded that the real transaction volume could be as low as one tenth of what the company purported to exchange.

Shi said after noticing the discrepancy, he immediately contacted the websiteâs customer service rep, who failed to provide a plausible explanation and later became unresponsive on Xueqiu.

During the process of communication, Shi saw that **the displayed volume suddenly plunged, which reinforced his suspicion that the website had previously faked its trading volume and was correcting it now that it was in danger of being caught red-handed.**

In an online audio interview, Shi said that he would not call OKCoin out and accuse it of manipulating the exchange rate, but he cautioned traders against the exchange, claiming that it âplays both the player as well as the refereeâ.

In response, Xu Mingxing, CEO of OKCoin who is also believed to be one of the largest bitcoin holders in China, issued a very brief explanation, in which he attributed the discrepancy to the company allowing large traders to trade through its API rather than the webpage interface â an explanation, if true, that may be somewhat hypocritical given that only a couple days ago Xu wrote a statement criticizing the use of âhigh-frequency trading softwareâ.

Many perceive Xuâs explanation as a cover-up, among them, some Chinese bitcoin celebrities such as Li Xiaolai and Zhao Letian who posted on Sina Weibo agreeing that OKCoinâs data was problematic.

Zhao Letianâs posting states:

**âThe two graphs show the market depth of BTC China and OKCoin. Despite the great difference of market depths, their trading volumes are very close, which can only mean that one is cheating. **The reason that I stopped going to OKCoin is that it is very hard for me to buy more than 1000 BTC [at one time].â

Users also question OKCoinâs claim that it is the worldâs largest litecoin exchange.

One posting published on 19th December on Sina Weibo says:

**âThe daily transaction of litecoin [on OKCoin] yesterday has reached an unprecedented nine million, but there are only a total of 20 million in existence.** How can I ever believe it?â

Xu Mingxing was previously scheduled to host a Q&A session on Xueqiu on 20th December, but it has since been cancelled.

As of 2:52 PM CST, 21st December, the daily trading volume displayed on OKCoin is 4,215.52 BTC, which has shrunk dramatically from its previous level of tens of thousands per day.There are already 3 other big chinese exchanges with litecoin and same volumes that last weeks
www.fxbtc.com
www.btctrade.com
www.chbtc.com 

When the prices beguns to go up. fxbtc.com was the exchange with more volume in litecoin during the first weeks

Otherwise this accusation is not verified

2013-12-22 16:07:02;Should I sell my 7950 or try my hand at mining?;"A lot of people are recommending mining more profitable altcoins. You can let an exchange like middlecoin take care of that for you. Just point your miner at it and it will mine the most profitable coin, trade it and pay you out in BTC. You should only do this if you are interested in the process as a hobby, you'll definitely learn a lot. It may be most profitable to sell the card and buy LTC or BTC and hold for 8 months. It may be most profitable to just sell the card walk away. If you can afford to lose the money, go for it!With a single 7950, I'd advise mining FTC or Doge.  May be more of a gamble (maybe not) than LTC, but the difficulty is really working against you with a 7950 (even 2 for that matter).Ask this question on /r/litecoinmining please.  Since mining at this point still seems practical (as in, it's possible without ASICs), you might as well try out mining to see what it's like. It'll probably become a hobby, it's pretty fun imho :) 

Worst-case scenario, you decide you don't like it but you end up with a bit of litecoin. Best-case? You like it and continue to earn litecoin until ASICs take over. 

Up to you dude, either way works.1 GB or 2GB cardI was faced with this problem as well. In the end I ended up mining litecoin with it. I also purchased some as well. However I live in a apartment with all bills paid so I'm pretty much paying nothing to mine. I don't recommend a 7950 all by itself if you have to pay extra for the electricity however. Not with litecoin at least.Mine altcoins other than Litecoin to get more coins, then exchange them. Fun fun fun. At the moment I'm mining FlorinCoins and DogeCoins.Mining isn't profitable at the moment due to price drops. You can either gamble and mine it out or you can sell it for an instant return for those who are willing to take the risk.Definitely try mining! "

2013-12-29 20:17:34;Noob here. How can I convert my Litecoins to real money?;"It can be done but may take a little while. At the moment, in the United States there aren't any particularly great ways to directly convert your LTC into USD. So what you have to do is exchange your LTC for BTC and then sell your BTC for USD.

There are plenty of exchanges that can handle the LTC-BTC exchange, they're over on the sidebar. Then set up a Coinbase account, if you haven't already, and once you have your BTC, transfer them to your Coinbase wallet and sell them there.

The actual process of receiving your money will still take a few days (and possibly a week).Convert to BTC on an exchange and sell using Coinbase (or localbitcoins if you'd rather do it in person.)

Or send them to me and I'll paypal you 20 bucks per coin ;]Ltc and btc are real money. I have a PayPal account I'm trying to empty/convert to crypto with ~$50 in it. If you are interested PM me and I can provide credentials. Cheers!

2013-12-29 17:13:04;Can someone smarter than me explain this graph please?;"So ill try;

* Green - Network difficulty, or current mining difficulty number to keep the block rate at 2.5 mins
* Blue - How much work was done (Shares) to get a block
* Red - How difficult mining a block is actually (based on difficulty and how many blocks are being discovered in a time period.) and what its difficulty is perceived as.

even though all the numbers are conveniently in the thousands, the y axis label is only valid for the blue graph.

Edit, totally missed the chart text: 
>The graph above illustrates N shares to find a block vs. N Shares expected to find a block based on difficulty assuming a zero variance scenario. Additionally our average number of shares per block is displayed (effective difficulty/pool luck).

so that means;

* Blue (Pool Luck) - How many shares were contributed to find a block.
* Green (Actual difficulty) - Expected shares / block
* Red (Effective difficulty) -  Average of shares found to expected shares.

It's basically saying that this pool (or the network, whichever applies) is having good luck and solving blocks in fewer shares than expected (red line below the green line) in the recent past.Because finding blocks is entirely based on luck & statistical probability, sometimes people (or pools) will get very lucky & find blocks in a short amount of time. It's possible to get a block solved on your first hash attempt, but obviously that's so unlikely it probably never will happen. Other times it will take rather long, but in the end, it averages out to the total hashrate that we have all seen in the overall graphs.Like I have an IQ of 99 or so... cuz I do. ;)* **SELL**"

They used my email address to reset and change my password. Luckely I had 2FA auth setup so they had to request an unlink before they could do anything, because of that BTC-e had locked down my account for 2 weeks.

I recommend everyone having the 2FA authentication. It is definitely a more secure way of protecting your account. Hackers or people who have just your email can reset and change your password without you knowing.There have been plenty of posts of people's BTC-E accounts being hacked, however every single one of them did *not* have 2FA enabled.  So I'm willing to bet the chance of being hacked with 2FA enabled is pretty miniscule.  But you know, never say never ;)

I'm assuming you're referring to 2FA using Google Authenticator, correct?  If you're relying on 2FA emails that would just be another attack vector (in which case, you should be asking how likely is it for your email to be hacked..).Make sure you have a good strong password on your email as well."

If you run Litecoin-qt from the command line and use the argument -dbcache=1000  it will sync a little faster as it gives it more RAM.  But still its not needed.  Just let the client sync by iteself if your having problems.

2014-01-19 18:27:42;Best way to buy ltc with visa gift cards?;"You aren't going to like this answer: You can't easily use CCs (or gift cards) to buy litecoins or bitcoins or any other crypto. This is because CC transactions are reversible but crypto transactions are not. So you could buy the coins and then contest the charge with your bank and make off with someones coins. The seller would have no recourse, so nobody really takes CC for litecoins. I think there's an exchange for Second Life currency, I forget the name.  
Basically, CC>SecondLife>BTC/LTCI will sell u ltc for visa gift cards. Let me know if you are interested.
Or u could sell the gift cards on eBay and just use the cash to buy ltc[Try Coin.mx](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1vkbt5/buying_litecoin_with_a_credit_card_using_coinmx/). You're going to spend more for the coins, but it might be your only choice."

2014-01-26 22:09:20;Tigerdirect to begin experimenting with litecoin (scroll down);"That news is better than nothing, I'm glad they are open to the possibility.

The [LTC give-away](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1w2vja/8_ltc_24hr_giveaway_0_making_another_super_easy/) I held had over 30 great entries requesting that TigerDirect (Newegg, Coinbase and Bitpay) open their doors to Litecoin. Hopefully that was a well timed push that helps sway their decision in our favor.I would also buy some pc stuff from them using litecoin.





If they do, we need to support this. They want to make profits and it costs a bit of money to implement Litecoin. I don't use tigerdirect (I prefer newegg ...and amazon on the rare occasion something is cheaper there), but I would if they started accepting LTC. I need a new case, GPU, and SSD for my desktop PC that doubles as a Litecoin miner when I'm not gaming.Yes!!!If they begin accepting it, this is certainly our time to shine. It's be great to see an article here on reddit that says ""tiger direct gains $400,000 in ltc sales in the first day""Well it's not bitcoiners buying their GPUs I wanted a new computer anywayTiger Direct fucked around with me on a purchase years ago, and I'll probably never buy from them again as a result of it, but that said, my experience is not everyone else's experience, and I support the adoption of crypto-currency for any major electronics retailer. They might as well. A lot of us are looking to buy equipment, and if they start accepting things like LiteCoin without gouging prices for video cards, they'll support the community, and support themselves.

 LTC is not going to be added to any major merchants (unless they keep the LTC and don't convert it to USD) for a while.  More exchanges need to adopt LTC before this is possible.  I would expect that after the next run up in price (for both LTC and BTC), there will be enough attention on LTC that this will start to happen. Great news, but don't expect the price relative to USD to increase. Deflation is partly the result of a large money supply without many goods, so the more goods the more stable the price, less deflation. I'm not an economic expert by any means, but that's my rudimentary understanding."

2) No clue on precompiled binaries, I mine on linux, and usually just compile anyways.  There is no advantage to mining in 64bit compared to 32 (at least based on what I know).upvoted you as I would like an answer too for the 1.

As for the 2, if you plan to mining using your GPU, then no difference since the computing would be carried out on the GPU itselfFor two there is a 64bit version of minerd, and it normally come packages with the 32bit version. It will make a hella difference with CPU mining, but no with GPU.

Edit: For one don't use iOS wallets, Apple is very anti-Bitcoin, they don't approve many wallets.

2014-02-09 23:54:18;Paypal assisted theft from my business -- I wish cryptos would become more widely adopted;"this story doesn't make any sense. Why would paypal need you to provide the guys credit card numbers? if its a transaction that went through their system, they definitely have them. I've had my fair share of chargebacks and not once was I asked to provide the OTHER parties credit card details. I simply don't have access to that info.

disputes show up on the transaction being disputed, you could easily see the person's name if you truly got hit with a dispute. 

I call bullshit on this. sympathy party denied.Hmm, I'm sorry to hear that you were another person on the ""bitter end of the stick"" as it were, however a few things don't make sense.

1. Paypal would be in violation of PCI-DSS regulations if they were to ask you to store this information, unless you were yourself fully PCI-DSS compliant. 

2. By taking orders over the phone you are opening yourself up to all kinds of risks, simply because there is no additional security that can be added in this way. The vast majority of chargeback IMO are from MOTO (mail order/telephone order) transactions - and if you intend to run your business this way, be prepared to have your account shutdown sooner or later by paypal because of the high dispute rates.

Usually paypal ask for proof of delivery, or maybe for services an invoice and some proof of work, but never would they ask for details that you shouldn't be storing. I am so angry hearing about this. I am working on a solution at the moment for businesses. Once it is up you won't even have to deal with paypal or credit cards when it comes to cryptos. 

Just knowing that I could've prevented this for you just makes me angry. I am sorry to hear. If you have the name and adress you can still get your money?Making up a story to shame traditional currency exchanging and to promote cryptos. Classy. 

Even if the story were true, what did you hope to accomplish by posting it? ""Proving"" that cryptos are better than any other currency?

If you have anything of value, be it digital or physical, someone can and will find a way to take it from you. There isn't any ""bulletproof-ness"" to anything, even bulletproof vests. So what actually happened - how and why did they file a chargeback?for online crypto stops charge backs and makes it safer for the consumer. But when for brick and mortar places you are stating to see things like the Bee card and CoinKite its hard to think that its in anyway safer for the consumer if someone gets your card and that charge backs could happen from centralized services like these.This reeks of BS or you just don't know what you are doing.

As someone who works in ecommerce with a website that has done millions in sales. I see chargebacks on a faily common basis via actual merchant accounts as well as paypal and paypal merchant.

A - Paypal doesn't give the CSV to you.

B - Without logging in, I am fairly certain the transaction shows the cardholders name in Paypal.

C- You mentioned you couldn't find the transaction. The paypal dispute would be located within your Paypal account, and that would state the transaction.


I am under the belief that you are high.

One - why Litecoin?  It's way too obscure for the average person, who doesn't even own bitcoin.

Two - The most common way to get LTC is through BTC.  It takes like 4-5 business days to buy via Coinbase for a first time user.  You're going to have to go through litecoinlocal or localbitcoins, due to the time constraints.

Three - I agree to not put the litecoins on the infected computer.  Your best bet is an android phone wallet, since you'll have to meet up with someone locally anyway.

This way if your computer's hard drive breaks down or you get affected by something like this again, you won't have to pay and the files can be recovered from the backup.Often the easiest way to get Litecoin is to buy them with bitcoin. What country are you in? "

2014-03-02 20:05:42;Free Market of Transparency, this has huge impact on the world;"I saw a video of Bill Gates talking about the CO2 emissions on TED and I think this is one of the things that could really help push people to make better choices in their shopping and perhaps raise the general awareness of polluting and what it does.

[Link for anyone interested](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaF-fq2Zn7I)

Edit: The video about Free Market of Transparency is about Bitcoin, but this applies to all cryptocurrencys. Also it was already posted on /r/bitcoin with no discussion on it.His videos on Transparency are really great. Transparency is way ahead of it's time, but in 1-3 years it will be used by everyone, if we stay a free market. It is the solution to ""Failure is an option"". If we can catch and monitor .bit businesses we can catch the cancer early.

No matter who starts a .bit business, it should be controlled by us and managed by the founders. You cant control something unless you have good data to do analysis."
2014-03-09 23:27:56;I've been away for a long time, but it's sure good to be back!;"Hang in there buddy! I followed the story but never purchased any thank goodness!

I expect to hear a lot of stuff like this over the coming weeks as Litecoin development further ramps up and people see how legit it really was/is. Thanks for sharing, from the stories I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been for yaI own both Litecoin and Dogecoin and I have quickly learned that the best way of protecting both coins is to ensure neither of the communities engage in *bickering wars* - it is possibly more counter-productive than one might realise.

Peace to all coins.

That said, I really don't see how Dogecoin can survive the January 2015 problem, but alas, whatever will be will be.I like Doge, and I like the some of the ideas behind it, but I don't think the coin or community is sustainable without adapting the coin to changing trends. Like fashion and music and anything else based on current tastes. The ""so wow"" stuff won't be cool in six months.

The Doge community should ask themselves this hypothetical question: Had cryptocurrencies been invented in the 60's, would anyone today still be trading FlowerPowerCoin, or LSDCoin, or MakeLoveNotWarCoin? Had crypto been invented in the 80's, would anyone still be trading DefLeppardCoin, or MimiViceCoin? Would anyone still be trading the 90201Coin or NirvanaCoin created in the 90's?

Trends come and go, and Doge is fully rooted in the current trends. People jumped on the Doge bandwagon the way people jump on any new trend, and they will jump off the wagon the moment ""so wow"" is no longer cool.

Doge needs to reinvent itself every six months, or else it's going to die. OP is a good example of this. He jumped on the Doge bandwagon when it was fresh and new, and now he's coming back to Litecoin because the Doge meme is getting old and boring.I really felt like if dogecoin worked hard with the Indie games they could have done alright.  I know there was a minecraft server that put them in random blocks.  I really thought that was awesome.  But yeah i dont see much left for the doge.  Looking at the comments it seems like you guys are reacting the same way bitcoin's community reacted to litecoin. Their community is slowly staring to turn toxic (I've seen some shit that really turned me off lately).  I think Doge at the moment is a good buy (the moment it hits 200 or so.. im out).  But, long term I wouldn't keep my any large portion of my holdings in that coin.

I hope they do well.  But, I'm not holding my breath.  I will however continue to hold my Litecoin's (and spend some).  I'm very excited overall about the future of cryptocurrencies if even every current coin is gone is 5 or less years and replaced with something even better.lol , welcome back Welcome back!

The best thing we have right now is our amazing developer team. So good in fact that they helped fix some of Bitcoins problems.Woooo rise chikun http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=oHUIU3HG1rkDogecoin began as a joke and it will end as a joke!

As the LTC developers work together to help improve and fix bitcoin, do the BTC community contribute to a similar fund? 

Charlie and Warren are an asset to Litecoin and the LTC community should realise how lucky we are to have them and all the other developers. 

It would be great if some goals were set though, mentally I think more people would donate:

eg/

200 LTC =  Commencement of X
500 LTC =  Completion and Release of Xdonated 1.04929851 ltc in 2 seperate lots :)Thanks everyone. Your donations are really appreciated. We are 1/3 of the way there!i dont understand why people are being so cheap about donating to the people doing this for the community, ive been mining doge for a while and have switched over to LTC in the past few days, im donating everything im donating everything ive mined so far to the Devs, 

keep up the good work guys! Come on guys we can make it. Will buy some LTC tomorrow at the current price and send it.I don't have much coin 16. But I believe in the cause so I have donated 2 towards the devs. Thankyou for all your hardwork.I donated 1.984 a few days ago,  will be donating 2 more next week, let's keep it going!Don't have much but i sent 0.49 their way. Hoping this goes to a thousand!i really dont understand the community, doge puts together money for charities, nascar visibility etc, and we cant put together 1000 coins? ..... wtf
Donated!  Keep going guys, this is a huge match and can go a long ways!Personally, I love this sort of community crowd sourcing. There's just something about complete strangers coming together and focusing on a common goal

The best way to prepare for LTC's future is to invest in the infrastructure now. Donations have slowed down a bit but next week, when we're feeling the positive effects of Huobi, consider taking a fraction of your gains and donating to the cause.Just sent 2 Litecoin as promised! It takes nothing for all of us to buy some Litecoin and send it to the developers. Come on guys we can do it!

Transition id : d07332cfcf38648698aa0ec778951fbfd81a0ed097a90accb8c1003eef914823A big thank you to everyone who has donated so far! We have less thank 400 LTC to go and BTC-China will DOUBLE the 1,000 LTC amount to 2,000 for the developers!

From BTC to doge to other alts, you should consider donating. All Scrypt alts will gain value from our developers work and BTC gets help from our devs as well!1.01 LTC donated. Too arrive shortly.. 
Best of luck :)the glass is over one third full....donated.  feels like i really made a difference!Should we not post  this in the bitcoin subreddit as well considering the fact that the litecoin developers help to fix many problems that bitcoin has?im sure were nearly 1k people here, i cant believe that people cant even donate 1 litecoin, how cheap can you guys be lol..... seriously

the devs give you the ability to literally print money and you cant contribute? whats wrong with people.....Well today being payday, I bought my final 10 litecoins to meet my goal  :) but I also bought 1 extra for the great devs of the litecoin community.

Is a further fund raise actually required? If so targets and expenditure breakdowns would be good.Is that because there will be 84 million litecoins produced? 
A nice round 100 :)Awesome, thank you Bobby for supporting the Devs! the donation is on its way!Donaters, please post your donations here so we can up vote you !Why doesnt BTC-China have a nice English Mode?

2014-03-09 18:44:45;Litecoin Wiki NEEDS your help! A call to arms;"There is your problem. Making people pay for being able to contribute for free. Make a better system, I wont pay to donate my own free time to the wiki. It's a principle, 0.1 LTC is nothing for those who would contribute. Can we have fee's to modify the wiki waved if we can get our account's verified using general stats from Reddit or Litecointalk?

The Wiki had been requesting 1LTC till recently for users to have editor access, 

Does it require more funding?Does the wiki need translators?When the litecoin.info wiki was first created, there was no spam prevention in place.

Within hours of going live, automated bots started creating accounts and spammed up the wiki. 100+ account were created in just hours, and the wiki wasn't even publicly announced. Those accounts created a huge number of spam pages/edits.

It was so bad that we had to delete the wiki completely, and start over.

We learned our lesson. We *had* to implement an anit-spam method. One of the best ways we though up were to disable public/anon editing and then have a small fee to create a ""full"" account.

After that, spam is all but non-existent. There have been a few spam accounts, but they were banned and they never returned because the price of spamming was not worth paying the fee over and over again.

The fees collected go to the Litecoin Association and help pay for hosting.

I agree that collecting a fee to have people sign up is not the best way to go about preventing spam, but it has been an extremely effective one.

If there are any other effective techniques available to prevent spam, I am open to hear them. But remember, we don't have enough volunteers to just ""deal with spam"" if we decided to open the floodgates.

For now, asking TheMage, Bossman, ThomasFX, or a member of the Litecoin Association to waive the fee is the best method we have for the community to get a wiki account for free. If you want a wiki account, please be an active and helpful member of the community. We need volunteers to collaborate together to create a vital resource for new Litecoin community members."

 1. Create and mount encrypted disk image
 2. Store encrypted wallet.dat on the disk image
 3. Unmount the disk image when not in use and keep it on an online cloud storage service

When I need to use my coins I decrypt and mount the cloud-based disk image, open wallet.dat with litecoin-qt, decrypt wallet.dat and transfer my coins. I don't have to go through this for deposits of course, just for withdrawals.Just using qt here. Keep good anti virus and don't be stupid. Backup and encrypt I do COLD storage for large amount of LTC. Which is about 35+ LTC for me. I keep several wallets. For the rest, I keep a hot wallet for fast transactions.a virtual machine on my server. I don't do anything on the VM other than  have it auto windows updates or when i make a transaction. The wallet is encrypted and all my machines run as standard user not Administrator. I only access the VM from my MAME arcade cabinet which never uses the internet. Every night it backs up the wallet.dat to a different datastore. Every week I copy the wallet.dat to my job's servers just in case. Not the most secure setup, but decently secure. You pretty much would have to hack my PC, then hack the VM, then hack the wallet encryption.Generate several private / public key pairs. Print off the QR codes, and evenly distribute your LTC to these new wallets in dominations you're ok working with (10 / 50 / 100 depending on your number of coins).

When you need to access your LTC using the Litecoin Android app, import the private key and it will sync and give you access to those coins. If you're afraid of your phone having malware etc, don't scan more then you need, and never re-use a given key.Get a wooden wallet : http://woodwallets.io coinkite"

2014-03-30 21:14:44;Australians?? Western Australians?;"Victorian here, where can I find out more about this Crypto-town? Do you have many local organisations offering their goods and services in exchange for cryptocurrency?**Australia: Cryptocurrencies Booming; Big Banks Stonewalling**

'[We] have no public position on Bitcoin.'
                                              Major Australian Bank

The crypto-terrain in Australia is changing by the week. Much is unclear; information-gathering takes time; let's publish now, and amend later:
a survey of Australian Bitcoin-accepting businesses revealed that the proprietors are coping very well with the uncertain regulatory environment. Indeed, one has constructed an accounting model that provides for both sales tax and capital-gains taxes. A distinction is evident between those who are themselves crypto-currrency enthusiasts, and those who recognised crypto-currencies as a payment-mode to implement alongside others.

The Australian Tax Office has a very reasonable system that provides formal rulings on questions submitted. '3667' on the ATO Website asks whether Bitcoin will be deemed to be a foreign currency for taxation purposes. Both an answer to this question and a workable set of regulations have been promised by the end of this tax year.

'Aus Trac' is the government body that deals with money laundering. It is directed by the Attorney-General's Department. Unfortunately, it simply seems not to understand what Bitcoin is -- thinks it's issued by a commercial enterprise -- and looks set to remain well and truly behind the curve.

The foremost problem, though, is the banks. Spokespeople from three of the 'Big Four' banks have offered disappointing 'positions.' One bank simply denied that anyone could be using its accounts to facilitate crypto-currency trades. Another claimed that it can't offer trading-services for Bitcoin because Bitcoin isn't a foreign currency (and an employee assured me that Bitcoin is illegal in Australia anyway . . . ). Yet another of the 'Big Four' directs me to the voicemail of media spokespeople who don't return the call.

What is also clear is that the left hand knows not what the right hand is doing. There are reports in the cryptosphere that at least one section of one Australian bank has been actively assisting Bitcoin traders.

Meanwhile, one bank not only didn't give me the run around when I sought information, they put me through to a Director. We talked for a half an hour, during which time I had him Google com-http.us, which showed him an index of perhaps twenty or thirty times more crypto-currencies than he had thought existed. This bank may shortly take an 'interim neutral' stance (and Coindesk and Australian coiners will be informed).

Sadly, several credit unions admitted off the record that the regulatory requirements for financial institutions in Australia were already so complex that they wouldn't even consider providing support for businesses that want to accept crypto-currencies.

One legal firm in Australia, LegalVision, now accepts Bitcoin (and I recommend Ursula Hogben's Sydney Morning Herald article 'The Legalities of Bitcoin'). One accountant -- who now has a wallet containing crypto-coins that we gave him -- is gearing up to take business from crypto-accepting businesses. Sadly, though, a survey of a range of accountants and accountants' official bodies revealed an almost hostile ignorance of the phenomenon.

In the crypto-sphere itself, more businesses are accepting cryptocurrencies, including those other than Bitcoin. Small exchanges have sprung up. An entire 'Crypto-Town Project' has been launched in Denmark, Western Australia; and a computer shop nearby already accepts four different cryptos 'over the counter.' Australian Dogecoiners began meet-ups wonderfully soon after their coin was launched. Overall, it is clear that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are not fazed by the lopsided mainstream-press focus on the problems, but clearly see the long-term viability of the technology.

Is there a forum post that I've missed? A mission statement? Etcetera? Do-It-Yourself 'Crypto-Town'

Hi!! Got enthusiasm!!

Now, there's a subtlety that we'll return to, but:

IndiaMikeZulu -- overworked family guy and disability-pensioner guy -- have begun developing Denmark, Western Australia, as Australia's first crypto-town.

One: why Denmark? It is small. It was looking for an 'alternative currency.' It has both locals with a countercultural backgrounds, and tech-savvy people who have bought homes in the district.

Two: 'suite-of-coins principle': we have chosen Dogecoin as the 'training-coin'; Litecoin as the 'local currency'; and Bitcoin as the Big Gun that will draw 'outside' money into the district -- that's 'zero sum' at first, which means we frankly hope to strengthen Denmark's economy by attracting 'Bitcoin Holiday Denmark' money from everywhere in the world.

Later, when/if local people -- certainly some young people -- realise the overall potential of cryptos, they will be exporting ideas and technology to the world.

Three: IndiaMikeZulu raised a budget of $1500 fiat to begin with.

Four: we created 'Red Dogs': a Red Dog is a tablet with both a Dogecoin and a Litecoin wallet, each containing a little coin.
No committee. No paperwork. We put three in circulation with influential local people -- for example, the manager of the local Resource Centre. We asked them to frankly play with the Red Dogs; show them to people; give them to any business interested in accepting crypto-currencies.

Five: we have started a 'micro coin-exchange.' This means that The Big Problem -- tangling with the difficulties of buying Bitcoin then converting it into other cryptos -- has been completely eliminated. You can put a hundred bucks into IndiaMikeZulu's account in the bank in this town; email us; and get some coin within the hour. We have undertaken to work on a '4% in; 4% out' basis -- or even less -- for some time. 

That is, IMZ has undertaken to provide a no-profit access to coin for anyone in this town and its district.

Six: we have begun 'B2B-telecanvassing' every accommodation provider, winery, and mainstreet business in the district. **B2B telecanvassing is the missing ingredient in The Whole Crypto Thing** -- it's time for us all to lift our eyes from the screen, and start explaining cryptos to the people around us.

Seven: we have also started running ads in the local paper, having flyers put in the local P.O. boxes, and having face-to-face meetings with pivotal local people.

Eight: there is a really cool series of markets in this town each year. The last one this year will be the first time that we 'trestle-table.' Trestle-tabling is taking a stall at a market (or similar -- you can set up shop in a booth in a cafe, for instance). Then you undertake to download and synch wallets on the spot. Explain cryptos. Sell people a pinch of coin -- and then perhaps sell them a cheese-and-tomato sandwich with the Litecoin they just bought, which provides a 'complete experience.'

Finally, here's the subtlety: we are working at this second to make Litecoin the 'main street' coin of Denmark (and there's a faucet for 300 000 Dogecoin). For just a little while, we hope to use Litecoin to draw money into Denmark's community. We aren't being sneaky about this. We aren't witholding information from anyone. But we do hope that the first experience Denmark people have with cryptos is that of a strong 'internal' network of Litecoin users, both individuals and merchants.

For this reason, we implore readers to help us develop something of an 'island' of crypto-usage for a couple of months. The Channel Islands has a big Bitcoin project, and Beaufort County, Washington is doing something similar with the Franko; but otherwise, Crypto-Town Denmark is a world first.

**An onslaught of on-line poker sites, pink-condom boutiques, and SilkRoadOz influences would be an utter disaster**. We hope to learn how crypto-currencies would function in a normal social and commercial environment. We have theorised our approach. We are learning by the day. (Ask what 'pre-exchange of coin' is.).

You notice that we haven't appealed for funds. What I ask Australian Litecoiners and Dogecoiners to do is call Raven's Cafe, and tell them that choosing cryptos was a choice that they won't regret:

08 9848 1163

There will be a 'semi-meetup' on Easter Saturday, the day of the Market. IndiaMikeZulu will be 'trestle-tabling' in the town. I will post updates here henceforth. 

Mark Blair, Unicup, W.A. m.j.blair.60@gmail.com

Ian and I are 'Litecoin-centric.' We think Dogecoin's vibrant community, and low cost, makes it ideal for 'first contact.' We feel that we must use Bitcoin as the Big Gun -- at least until Litecoin knocks it from its perch.
I shall post here every few days, as I want to maintain momentum.

The Easter Market is the next big event.

And I shall give the Litecoin market just a few days to clearly pick up before I start contacting 'main-street merchants.' Every day we learn something new about not-entirely-Internet-centric commercial development of crytos. **It's a new world.**

Gotta chuck in a thank you to Litecoin Australia. The moderator has been endlessly patient and helpful. 

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western Australia.Morning! I shall post regular snippets, to keep this thread alive:

of course, this is a very very difficult time to have launched such a project -- but IndiaMikeZulu expected it, and we respond to circumstances as they change.

Today's snippet: for your first 'prototype Litecoin-accepting business,' look for a business that posts items (means we can bring them business from all over Oz), that is not flat-out busy, that sells things that aren't **too** expensive, **whose proprietor has her smartphone on the front counter.**

Please feel free to ask us **any questions at all**. **We really really need all the help we can get**, as we are a hobby business. We are staunch of heart, and we really know what we are doing; but The China Thing is cruelly hammering both crypto credibility (for new-comers!) and our finances. (We have put up around 300,000 Doge as a 'training-coin.' Feel free to ask Why Doge?)

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western Australia
A Snippet Every Day ('til the Easter Market):

think about this: you're standing at a busy cafe counter. Wanna pay with Litecoin. Now, I shall test this; but I do see that it sometimes takes minutes for transactions to go through.

So, hmmmm . . . you enter in the wallet the Australian Dollar figure of your purchase. You swing the wallet around to the employee. She sees the correct amount entered. She sees the name of the cafe in the address slot. She hits the send button. Then you get that 'light grey' text that tells you the transaction is underway.

Something like this??

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western AustraliaToday's Snippet:

we're looking for potential commercial adopters who will 'tie into' the network we are creating. 

For example, people in the towns down here in the South West do a good deal of travelling to Perth. So, if Litecoin (et al.) are the Denmark coins, we will look for a couple of sandwich shops and a couple of service stations on the highway to Perth that might start accepting cryptos.

The owners of those businesses might holiday or buy wine or other products in the Denmark district -- **cryptos gotta go around and around!!** That's how currency works.

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western AustraliaAnother Snippet:

the value of face-to-face canvassing -- explaining the project -- is becoming very clear. Western Australians with landline phones have been hammered in recent years by Indian and other scamcallers. Businesspeople are inundated by 'social media' messages, which are becoming less and less effective.

So, we are trying to do some shop-to-shop canvassing every time we go to Denmark.

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western AustraliaSnippet: perhaps the purchase of fig jam for LTC next week will be a world-first. Wa ha ha

Our 'main-street strategy' has boiled down to 'bread and milk.' That is, if a merchant in a small town can spend the LTC she has taken on basics like bread and milk, you have a 'loop' -- the currency is a currency.

So, we are striving to nail one 'bread and milk' business. Could be the local paper, or a bakery. A service station's products-except-petrol would do the job.

MarkSnippet:

we are learning the need to patiently 'tie' cryptos to Ordinary Stuff. It is a Giant Leap, for example, for a business person who has never even heard of Bitcoin to just decide to start accepting cryptos as payment -- especially considering the regulatory situation.

So, we are gonna pay -- in fiat -- for a night's accommodation for two at a local B and B. Then we will 'raffle' it for one Litecoin, via an ad in the local paper.

If any Litecoiners are gonna be down the South West at Easter, you are welcome at my place (between Manji and Barker) and there will be a half a dozen crypto-coiners at Denmark on the Saturday.

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western AustraliaSnippet:

We have two 'Australian' coins in development. One is Australia Coin. The other is the Noble. It is our policy to foster relations rather than squabble: a rising tide lifts all boats.

Just yesterday, in Little Town Nearby, I found a merchant who had been approached by a company to sell a crypto-fiat gift card. Karmacoin.

And Some Old Guy at a market was talking about cryptos. 

And finally got a link to Deepest Inner Workings of a Major Australian Bank: What's the go with cryptos, Mr Bank? Details to follow

Mark Blair, Unicup, W.A.Last snippet:

without a doubt, the citizens of the western world are in a state of hyper-affluence/debt/regulation overload.

So any success at all with on-da-street development at this point is a triumph. 
People are, quite literally, running about like headless chickens.

It is the global financial crisis, which so few people seem to really comprehend, that will be the eventual primary driver of cryptos.

Today, though, we learned some stuff: 

(a) mention early in your spiel that governments don't issue cryptos; that Governments hate them; that they can't control them; that they represent real competition for the banks.

(b) mention early that the coins are volatile and still under development. Offer to help people with understanding the technicalities. Whip out your smart phone, and send a pinch of coin -- let them push the 'Send' button!!

(c) Less is More: three or four businesses in a small town is a solid base for development if the users of those businesses can spend the cryptos taken at the other businesses. 

Compare this to months of 'giveaways.' A few easy-to-get coins are helpful to show a newcomer how a wallet works (or at least, if you are giving coin to newcomers, offer them fulsome assitance in learning the ropes). The faucet and 'Newcomer-Assistance Volunteer' can be based on the Home Forum. 

Beyond that, though, it's just parking lots of tiny amounts of coins in dead-end alleys -- but it's popular 'cause it's an alternative to the hard yards of real development, whether on the Net or the Street.

It looks as though the average cost of getting a merchant up and rolling will be hundreds of dollars and hours of planning and telephoning and travel and running community coin-exchanges. 

But that's not the point. The point is that a network of just three or four such merchants (provided with a facility to convert their crypto back to fiat fast and easily if necessary)  is a sufficient base for developing cryptos in a city of a million people 
-- a couple of thousand bucks spent doin' the hard yards, a whole city of crypto-folk as the prize.

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western Australia
Still at it. Got Litecoin accepted at the local Resource Centre. Feel free to pile in.

Mark Blair, Unicup, Western AustraliaHi, everyone. A month seems like a month ago. Crypto Town Denmark is goin' gangbusters. The Denmark Community Centre is accepting cryptos. The 'bottom' IGA supermarket will be accepting Litecoin and Bitcoin within days. Two businesses nearby are accepting Litecoin (and CGB soon).
The Business Facilitation Officer of the Chamber of Commerce has a positive attitude.

We are dropping of jam-and-chutney gift packs -- purchased with Litecoin -- to a number of people and businesses in the town. We have purchased a $100 Mitre 10 Gift Card, which we will donate to charity.

Now, Litecoiners . . . the tourism portion of the Project has just started. It will use Bitcoin -- but that's not the point. The point is: will Litecoiners in W.A. and Australia give us support? We don't want money or donations. We want emails sent, and phone calls to Influential People made. We want to know if Perth Litecoiners can stop into Denmark to spend some Litecoin.

We contacted the CGB community here in Australia; and I gotta say: their reaction has so far been very very good.

I look forward to renewed interest!

Mark Blair, Unicup, W.A.  04 399 58791

P.s: we have had to pull Dogecoin from the Project because the transaction times were so slow, including a number of 'hung' transactions. Litecoin has been fine, but I think some of us should do some transaction-time tests. It would be a real boost for Litecoin if it turns out that Bitcoin is actually really slow down here near Albany and Denmark!!**WORLD FIRST: 'NATION-BASED' CRYPTOMALL**

opening this month, a cryptomall -- essentially a directory of (verified) Australian Bitcoin-**and-altcoin-**accepting businesses, with a Big Agenda:

full-time developer (who answers the phone)

non-profit (we hope to source low-cost coin down the track)

chat room

bullion sales

etc etc

**We're aiming at Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Darkcoin, Nxt, and CGB** That is, we call on **Australian altcoiners** to help us set up an array of **clumsy, unprofitable, time-consuming interim models** that will provide **transactional** volume to your coin.

It's a clunky cutting-edge rush into the crypto future.

Disconnect from internet
reboot with live cd in ubuntu
plug in USB and install litecoin client, install truecrypt.
Open Truecrypt, create a small container ( 1MB is fine ) and choose a UNIQUE password that you can remember but will never use anywhere else.
Open Litecoin, genareate a few addresses.
Encrypt your Litecoin wallet with the litecoin client and choose a 2ND UNIQUE PASSWORD that you will remember but do not use anywhere else.
Create a document in the usb file and paste your generated addresses.
Backup Wallet through litecoin app Into truecrypt ( for paranoids like me, also backup the actual wallet itself in truecrypt )
Close all programs and un-mount the truecrypt image.
Open truecrypt image to make sure your password is good:)
Transfer truecrypt image to USB Key
Plug usb key to a computer WITH internet, and send it to at least 5 of your friends and to all your e-mail addresses.

Personally, I run all my cgminer sessions via ssh on each computer using tmux. This way I can access every computer from a centralized source.CGRemote is currently only available for Windows, but it will connect to miners on any os. So you only need one Windows computer to run CGRemote itself. We're in the process of porting it to a web application (along with mobile apps). I know that may not mean much right now to someone without a Windows pc... but we are working on it. I can't go into details yet, but some of the things our software will do are just awesome. ;)I've found that TeamViewer is the best, it works on relatively slow internet and I have all of my rigs listed w/o issue and I can periodically check in on each of them.

Such as [this](http://i.imgur.com/8VOnAlJ.jpg)

What I do is, i run all my miner.sh's in ssh from a homesever that i connect to with teamviwer. alternately you can run ssh a computer outside the network but the port forwarding could be a pain.

2014-05-04 20:17:45;Question to owners of Businesses accepting Litecoin, how much do you earn through Litecoin?;"My business started accepting Bitcoin about a week ago, and we let people walk away with a zero confirmation receipt, which basically takes about 15 seconds.  Out of 8000 or so customer transactions, 3 were in Bitcoin.  For some reference, this is a gas station, not an internet business.

Consumer adoption of cryptocurrency is going to take years, not months, so be sure to set your expectations appropriately.Hey, Username!!

Indiamikezulu has a strong commitment to 'on-da-street' crypto development. As part of this -- here in Australia -- I did a survey of about 25% of all businesses that accept cryptos, which was, three months ago, BTC and just two LTC-ers.

Here's the low down:

it's early early days yet. The adopters are either crypto folk themselves, or have picked up Bitcoin as a payment option. There are some surprisingly sophisticated accounting models in place -- that is, these merchants have dug in deep.

Indiamikezulu is working on on-da-street crypto development, which is an **amazing** experience. Indeed, prices will be low until The China Thing blows over -- which it will -- so (a) keep working at 'bread-and-milk loops,' which is helping to use Litecoin **any** two people who regularly exchange money, and (b) keep patiently buying coin.

The Big Picture is clearly clearly clearly indicated by the inflow of capital, advancemnt of technology, adoption of cryptos by institutions, and more public knowledge. We have only been in the game a year. 

It seems like a million. You could hardly buy a thing with a crypto in Oz in April, 2013. Now you can buy a good deal of stuff.

There's a difference between prices and potential. **Prices are down. Potential is way way up!!**

Straight out of the woods, cleaned and into the dehydrator they go. From there we process the ramps into a unique âramp dustâ that makes a superb seasoning. This stuff is potent and powerful, one small sniff could knock a frail man to his knees.

The only thing is this mini shaker bottle is ramps. One half ounce of them to be exact. There are no additives.

Keep the springy seasonal flavor of your favorite dishes extended all year long with this great ramp seasoning.

Add this seasoning to red meats for a great new taste. Try some on your fish or chicken for a different kind of flavor. Or my personal favorite, sprinkle a little bit on a sunny side up egg every morning to give you a little pep in your step for the rest of day. It doesn't take much, this stuff is strong.

NOW ACCEPTING LITECOIN!Please x-post to /r/AcceptingLTC.This is brilliant. Proves I'm not the only ramp-digging crypto miner! We've got one hell of a ramp season here in WNC too. And it also means morels...

Dried morels for LTC perhaps? Hmmm...I had some ramps for the first time during an Easter brunch. I've never tasted anything like them and I enjoyed them very much! This is something my wife might like.Being a cook myself, I love spices. What exactly do you put in your seasoning? I couldnt find an ingredient list. Is ""ramp seasoning"" slang for something?"

That one company sending 2 refund checks that aren't cashable, just wow.  Is there an upside?  I'm curious of stories from those that make it in the first batch shipped on new products, are they making a ROI these days?Buying ASICS is definitely a sucker's game. You pay for them to get the hardware then they mine with it until it isn't profitable anymore and then send it to you. 

Better to just by LTC outright. This is why preorders are bad. This is why sending a company with no reputation $10k is badGridseeds!This is why ASICS are shitty, not for what they do to the network, but for how the people in the company's treat the miners and the coins...
Title is misleading. It seems the issue is companies spawning up from no where and having no regulation. In the business world, there is time stamps and requirements on delivery to protect a delay impacting business which these companies don't have. If they say we will deliver in March and don't to July after other companies have shipped then you should be able to dissolve your order. Typically these companies rely on similar stock and manufacturing which is affected by higher bidders overseas. Litecoin's entire purpose for existing is gone. It's a dead duck. Bail out while you can. Preorders and 'expected ship dates' are bullshit. 
Scrypt Rigs only sells the hardware they have in hand. 26MH/s Scrypt ASIC's shipping as soon as payment is received. www.scryptrigs.comSo basically don't buy now? All these companies are rather new compared to the guys you buy all your other computer hardware from anyways. I doubt AMD was doing so great after 2-3 years when compared to now. None of these companies have really established them selves yet and many of them have sprung up out of nowhere. In time some of them will get things together. Scrypt ASICs are new products. There are some rough edges right now and it will take some time to settle. Bitcoin network runs with ASICs and soon Litecoin network runs with ASICs. BTC would not be where it is today without ASICs. ASICs are good for Litecoin and proof of it's success."

2014-05-18 12:39:49;Idea for Litecoin Pool;"I like this idea.  It would be good for Bitcoin as well.  Obviously there are challenges, and I am no expert computer coder, but I think it should be doable some how.

Several obvious problems to this. First off, there is little incentive for a pool operator to do this. Of course, not being a threat to the network should be enough of an incentive, but I would think that some pools under the same boat as Coinotron would feel like that the situation would be blown out of proportion. They wouldn't dare threaten their beloved coin? Except when they get hacked and it's game over.

Secondly, especially with the GPU->ASIC transition, there are a lot of big miners right now. A pool with <40% of the hashrate could become >50% of the network with just a few of them. How would the pool know how big the miners are until it's too late, leading back to the same problem?Stop trying to solve a problem that shouldn't exist. Everyone should be using [p2pool](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/P2Pool).

> and then piggybacking off bitcoin devs for new resources

over the past year or so the litecoin devs have contributed no nearly half of all improvements to the bitcoin protocol.  To say that they are piggybacking off of bitcoin is wrong and deeply insulting to Warren and Coblee.Just hodlSo why r companies investing in so much money to build scrypt asics again???

Is it because they see that litecoin (which has the highest scrypt-coin hashrate and second largest marketcap) is worth investing that much money, time and effort into mining it?

If coinotron attacked it, they would lose their most profitable mining coin, why shoot the goose that lays the golden egg?

Whats the difference between bitcoin and litecoin? Whats the difference between mastercard and visa? Both 2 huge global companies which survive against another ..... Because people like choice.

I dont believe that 'there only has to be one coin for everybody to use and the rest is just crap'.. But why not more than one or even a bunch to eliminate the singlepoint of failure of just having only one network? Litecoin has been around for ages the fact that asics were developed for it means that the mining companies see thats its worth investing in and people can sling as much mud as they like but... It still has the second biggest marketcap.

Just my opinionhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/26fu7n/ghashio_over_40_hungry_again_stay_away_from_this/Now is the time to have our say: 

IndiaMikeZulu has been working in Australia on a non-profit commercial crypto-development Project for months. Several times we have asked for help. Not a single Australian Litecoiner has volunteered even one hour of assistance.

The price was ""stagnating"" according to you pessimists before the run up to $49 as well. 

If you think that a few months of quiet means the end of the world, this market really isn't for you. 

If the last bubble was any indication, i wouldn't be surprised to see BTC rise to 3000-4000 before we really start to see LTC move. There was no 51% attack.  Quit spreading FUD.

51% attack? Please study a bit the subject before jumping to conclusions I'll say this again and again. Ltc has the strongest development team which works with btc team and being apart of the community and reading on other crypto nothing compares to our community.

2014-05-24 14:12:04;What happened;"This is very simple and I am very surprised no one has mentioned this:

1. A2 Terminators point all their hash to coinontron to mine while they complete their customers' orders.

2. A2 Terminators start to ship to customers.

3. Customers point their A2 Terminators to other pools after they receive them and turn them on.

4. Hash is reduced on coinotron.


How do I know this? Its very simple. All A2 Terminators ship with a preconfigured config to mine to Innosilicon's account on coinotron.

They created a new pool that they niw control and has the other 20% nothing changedunder the pressure from the community, the miners were forced to ""spread"" their rigs over several pools.
also, another factor is that the big chinese miners that were testing their asics actually completed their trials.Seems like their hashing power decreased.The community decided to revolt the tell the pool their hash rate of the network was too much, and I have never been more proud of this community for standing up and telling them they need to cut back!"

2014-06-01 16:57:23;Mining advice;"I asked GAW for a refund, it has been a month and they haven't done it yet.   I would recommend a different supplier.My advice: Don't start mining. Things are about to get really, really hairy in Scrypt mining this summer and it's not going to sort itself out for quite a while. The little guy is going to get caught in the undertow. Take the money you would have spent on a miner, and buy Litecoin with it.In general that is a great way to start. But personally I would wait for about two weeks before buying one. The reason for this is that in about 2 weeks a new brand of miners will hit the market, which in turn will reduce the prices (and value) of the older miners. If you do not have much experience with mining I also recommend having a look at [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com/). They have a good product and an easy mining interface. You will find a review [here](https://cloudmining.guru/wp/category/reviews/). I think they won the contest.

I don't even know any time in btc or ltc where it has been better to buy miners. I mean if i bought coin i would have 5x what I have now without electricity costs 


oh something else that you don't often think about, as for accounting costs 

the amount of time you spend worriing/checking/fixing/pool switching/et cetria is a huge amount of work, would not do it again.[deleted]Firstly, you'd get batch 2 @ $7K / 400MH/s. They're targetting a month after your first Titan, or worse case 31 October.  

Secondly, The issue KCN calculators are based off a 3% nominal rise in difficulty; it's risen 6% nominal since the A2's and Zeus' hit the market. Once the KNC's hit, I think would you'll see double that over the saturation period, a small dip repesenting latency for the batch two's or the +500MHs devices (or 20nm technology) which will be shortlived if LTC goes >.3 BTC/LTC, rinse and repeat...

In closing, I'd hold or halve the BTC good sir. This is coming from a guy that spent 477 LTC for 1/2 a Titan and I don't expect to get that back without some HW fenagling Buy a LTC/BTC ASIC wouldn't that be more cost effective?Wouldn't use BTC to buy the asics, there's a good chance we will see a big surge in BTC when asics are fully functioning (people will trade their script coin into btc to recover their investment)  you might end up with less then you started.. I know demand of btc is not the only thing influencing the price, but still... In my opinion i enjoy mining. I find it exciting and i always search for new altcoins. Remember that you always will have the miners and you can whenever leave LiteCoin for a new exciting coin. It may not be the most profitable way but the most fun way :)
It depends on how trustworthy you think KNCminer are as a company.  Do some research then decide whether you think they will all arrive on time and in good shape.Yes, buy them...that'll be five more miners that won't add to the network hashrate until fall. :)

Protip: KNC just finished tape-out. Alpha Technology did it in mid-April and plan to ship in July. So if that gives you any ideas about the timeframe...you will know that there's no way KNC ships before September (the end of their Q2/Q3 target). Network difficulty will have been driven through the roof in those intervening months.http://youtu.be/i0CW39q0TrYFrom experience, i bought a Btc machine, Jupiter, from them. It took a month from the time. I ordered it. However, at the time shipping dates were announced. 

This situation is a little trickier since no specific dates have been announced. I always say assume the worst with the shipping dates and think about the difficulty change. 

Bitcoin doubled in the time i got my rig,but because litecoin has a smaller time for adjusting to difficulty you should assume far greater. In the time you will receive the rigs other asic rigs will be out. And not to mention you would be in the second batch. 

So assume the difficulty will go up between five to ten times which i say just say ten. Would it be worth it. Possibly it all depends. On your power situation. 

Im strongly for buying new rigs when theyre top tier ones. For some reason people are very against buying these rigs because ""you will lose money"" i dont agree with this entirely if youre smart about it. 

TL;DR Take into account that more asic rigs will be out, difficulty will strongly increase,  dont forget the electricity costs. If you dont have electricity costs however, its much more favorable.

You could probably use that money to invest in stocks. Look into Vanguard 500 (return rate of 10%) in seven years you can double your money,  much safer and smarter. I do this im doing fineMining is nice because your balance keeps increasing day in, day out.  

My recommendation is to not spend all of your BTCs on mining equipment as there has been some terrible incidents in the past involving mining equipment companies.  Buy one and you will have 100x+ more mining power than myself.  I love my gridseeds.  I love mining.  You will too, but don't overdo it.  -just my thoughts :)KnC is the new BFL, they are selling and shipping loads of miners to retailers who can purchase large amounts at much lower prices. they're making a lot of money and they don't care about individual buyers. If you purchase less than 10-20 units, they will probably ship them to you after shipping all requests from wholesale partners like bitdeals. You should watch their partners websites for when they start selling the miners, [bitdeals](http://bitdeals.ca) began shipping knc miners a couple of days ago at very good prices.
Don't preorder from KNC!
I hope you didn't buy any.  November and I'm still waiting....still waiting.....did u get your pre ordered one yet?If you buy 5, you should donate one to me cause you're awesome and cool ;).

2014-06-28 13:28:18;Litecoin slogan;"pretty sure there should be some bounty managed for a legit branding agency on this.

oh now is a great time to buy.""Commerce, at the speed of Lite.""

My wife liked it so that's my submission :)Litecoin: Winklevoss FreeTo me, the main message should be around the following idea: ""Litecoin the light, fast, liquid, digital currency.""Since it seems like we're doing this publicly, something to think about:    for ideas on longer slogans, puns on the word ""lite"" alluding to weight or light are definitely rib tickling, but they lack a deeper substance. (If one is to ponder the slogan, it would go, ""why litespeed/liteweight>the word sounds like light>end."" This is why forming a private email marketing group would be great to really come up with the image of the coin.    If the concept we want the public to understand is that all of us can use Litecoin to help build a new financial infrastructure, a slogan like ""Litecoin, do something"" would be much more profound because it foreshadows the technology's non-immediate benefit. Not the immediate benefit (this is money with an ambiguous word in the name). In this case the consumer pondering would go ""why do something>why does this change finances>informative conclusion."" I know that sounds like a small chance difference, but tying a big picture into the creative copy, especially the slogan, is very important. The pores of the coin's image should just seethe the image we decide on.  [deleted]Step into Light, Litecoins bright.I keep thinking of those lite brite commercials whenever I try to think up a slogan.yes we coinImagine a marketed landscape where we create a theme based on : 1.Revolution but without the abandon of revolution. (to keep the tone calm)2. A sort of copy tone that is a rabbit hole teacher and exhibits characteristics in the written words of ""just a second, look at that"" ""hold your breath, listen to that noise.""    Written copy would be akin to these principles and the most technical paragraphs would only be found in the technical pages or in a soft mission statement:    ""A coin is something everyone understands; an idea that can be tossed, bounced, tucked in your pocket - a coin is a shared dream. Litecoin represents an idea of a world changing currency without a central authority. It's based on the architecture of Bitcoin and strives for a truly practical money. Some might miss the gamble of heads or tails, but we were never ones to laugh all the way to the bank.""    So if that's our least branded copy, and we have a nice little theme going, which is basically what we're all sounding off one way or another, we could get away with something short and sweet like, for the above example of change and leaving: ""Litecoin. Escape.""The future's bright, the future's lite.  (similar to cobordism)Not in the face![deleted]Take a byte out of lite.the slogan must be:    1. clever and 2. descriptive of what it is.

or at least   1: appealing to the mind and ears  -  2:  descriptive of what it is.

none of that ""the lite of the new digital era "".... people need to know why they want it

""Commerce, at the speed of Lite.""... this one is good.. closer.. but not still not descriptive enough

how about: 

""Litecoin:   Real digital money...  fast, cheap to transfer, and accepted worldwide.. Its commerce, at the speed of Lite!""Speed of Light? Speed of Lite!The Other Bitcoin.

2014-06-28 02:03:49;The Official Litecoin Video;"The second one, by Noah, is better of the two for several reasons. The primary reason is it's much more upbeat and done in a more positive tone over all in both it's look and the sound track, The major negative about it though are the color schemes and some of the fonts. The worst is the drab gray background and some of the really bad font towards the end. By tweaking those elements, I think that video would be a true winner. Noah's video is better but it could shave 15 secs off it so it doesn't feel so long.   
Jesse's has too much stuff on the screen and has a darker tone to it which I do not think helps for the general public. It needs to be simple to the point. voted. Awesome job from both guys!
Hello,
Videos are quite nice, but I got the feeling that Litecoin was presented too much as yet another new crypto that was just created very recently, with no distinguishing features and uniqueness put forward.

In the video 2, if you replace

 ""created in 2011"" by ""created in 2013"",

""more than 80m"" by ""more than 200m"",

it becomes an official promotional video for the digitalcoin (DGC) (http://digitalcoin.co/) 

The only moment where some Litecoin character is put forward is when the video tells vaguely that there are some numerous exchange through which you can exchange litecoin for fiat.

I believe that it will not be sufficient to attract users, I am afraid.

But let's get back to the facts: Litecoin is almost 4 years old; it has achieved achievements! for God's sake,  to the difference of the rest of the 500 coins and that is a huge differentiating factor!

Why should we stay in the crowd when we have the credentials to get out?

For your reference, I mention below some promotional videos of some direct Litecoin competitors that are going to knock at the door of your customer, before or after Litecoin:

- Blackcoin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGjjoD6PP-8

- Nxtcoin : http://vimeo.com/97822417
Voted!I have put here the comment that I put in litecointalk.
--
Both videos are nice trys but I do no think they reflect well the core values of  [ltc].
Why should we be focus on ""the future of commerce""?
I can use  [ltc] for just investing for the future or just gambling or speculating.
I think it would be limiting the possibilities of litecoin to just focus on commerce.
It is true though that ltc is more appropriate than btc for commerce.

Litecoin is the little sister of Bitcoin.
Whether you like it or not.
But it is an improvement. It is a more advanced crypto-currency.
I understand that we should not insist on bitcoin in the video and in the marketing of litecoin in general because it would put litecoin in the shadow of bitcoin for ever but you cannot change the truth: litecoin is a fork of bitcoin but an improved fork.
In other words, litecoin is a better crypto-currency than bitcoin.
By the way, Andreas of the bitcoin community recently alluded to the fact that bitcoin may not be the currency of the Internet, but certainly a good digital asset.

Mentioning that litecoin is derived from bitcoin would be fair and transparent, imho.

So my suggestion would be to get inspired from the bitcoin's presentation video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2en3nHxA4] with the following additional statement
- ultra fast (comparatively)
- ultra liquid (comparatively)

The main message: Litecoin the light, fast, liquid, digital currency.

We must have in mind the fact that most people that will get interested in litecoin know already about bitcoin.

Therefore, I am not satisfied with the videos suggested, although i think they are nice trys and I really thank the creators for their hard work.
They certainly deserve a lot of gratitude.
--Noahs video.  Lets enhance the grey colors a bit.  It looks serious which is great, but it also looks drab.I have voted for Jesse''s.  They both should be used IMO as they speak to different demographics."

2014-07-06 23:50:54;What can I buy with litecoin?;"I think right now one of the best places to find where to spend your LTC might be: http://www.litecoinlearner.com/

Soon there will be some other resources like litecoin.com and others that can direct you to merchants that will accept litecoin. 

In addition many places that accept bitcoin also accept litecoin.

Do you have any specific questions about the wallet? Litecoin.com and some other sites in the works should have some resources as well (like video guides on how to use your wallet) soon. Came to mention:  http://www.shinybars.com/
and others - but see that litecoinlearner was mentioned (and it is much more exhaustive.) 

But I honestly don't know why this is getting down voted.  I really think that we have a strong community, great dev team (really really great), and heart - but we really haven't got the merchant/vendor adoption that we ought to have, which is odd to me.  

I think that a lot is riding on Coinbase picking up litecoin - with all those folks that can pay/sell/buy through them being brought online in that moment they decide to flip that switch to ltc.  However, I don't think that this is the correct way to think about it (it's basically the all eggs in one basket approach.) 

What to do?  I think anyone posting here or in any of the other cryptocurrency sub's are probably true believers and talk up this great and awesome technology to everyone we know (I do.)  But we need to get more sellers/vendors to accept - maybe we ought to encourage everyone to ask if a store/vendor takes litecoin at checkout.  Get more and more people thinking about litecoin.

IF you buy litecoin, BTCe is the best place to do it. They have the most liquidity and offer the best price. If you want to buy various other alts, mintpal has taken over as being the main exchange for everything but dogecoin. 

I personally have not lost coin from Cryptsy and they have been very supportive of the support tickets I have opened which is great, but their site is laggy and their trading engine is awful, and you should not have to message support on a withdrawal that didn't do anything for 36 hours, and then gets send within 30 minutes of me messaging them.

2014-07-06 15:19:56;How can Litecoin devalue, when the difficulty is rising so much?;"The majority hashrate is held by relatively few miners right now and they have been dumping everything they mine, ostensibly in a race against time, as they know the next generation of systems is hitting in a few weeks.Because (people believe) it is not very useful, same as Bitcoin, only it doesn't even benefit from being the first one around.I tend to think that lots of miners dump litecoin as soon as they get it. Then they either cash out or buy and hold bitcoin. 

More people are entering the bitcoin ecosystem. Only a small percentage of those people will purchase another type of coin. So bitcoin ""bounces back"" faster than litecoin.

Speculators flee when prices fall. ""The trend is your friend"".

There have been lots of other coins gaining mind-share and news stories lately, like darkcoin, etherium, etc...I'm not positing the benefits, just that there have not been a lot of litecoin articles lately. News does tend to move prices.

Lots of other coins are creating unique features, solving problems or tackling new markets. Colored coins, virtual organizations, crowdfunding, proof of stake/work, etc...There does not appear to be any innovation in litecoin. I'm almost certainly wrong, but that's my perception.

There are more coins to invest in than before. Marketplaces have gotten really fast about adding new coins to trade. There's just more places to put your money today.

A lot of people are really underwater on litecoin as I am. This makes me (personally) hesitant to get back in until I see something compelling or new that will make me change my mind. 



more people trying to mine litecoin at the same time more selling is going on... many say its the miners themselves recouping there money.same thing happening with Bitcoin. BTC diff has increased 25-30 times compared with November/December but the price was halved.

Price is controlled by supply and demand, not by difficulty.I just want to point out that the past few weeks this sub has been the quietest I have seen it in a year. If people aren't interested people aren't going to buy. I really don't think ASICs play a huge role in the price falling. We need to get more people interested and generate more demand. Perhaps a conspiracy theory but word on the street is that more effective scrypt ASICs are out and a lot of immediate coin dumping taking place. That said I haven't checked the numbers so I don't know if this is just another urban legend. Easy. Supply is larger than demand. Price is going down."

And people are getting fearful around holding their litecoin so I will buy soon when its seemingly the worst thing to do.[deleted]It's really a toss up in my mind. Litecoin may in fact be relegated to the history bin. But I want to be a part of that history. I don't think there will just be one electronic currency as represented by bitcoin. Whether or not it's litecoin remains to be seen. Litecoin has to develop an commercial infrastructure where it is accepted for something to jump start it. time to buy more before the big rally. instantaneous rally.No need for doom and gloom guy, most long-termers know their risks and see difficulty more in deciding how low until making a buy. I hope no one gets hurt too much though, it is a rough patch so ride it out. Alright then we will buy at the bottom. What matters the most is that Litecoin is here to stay and the value with time will for sure go up.

Let's don't foget that a lot of people bought at 40 or more.Absolutely time to buy ... and I am! :)Riding it out I like litecoin... im buyingThe OP is a witch! Burn him!none of those for sale are my litecoins. Really nobody can say what's going to happen, but I consider my LTC ""sunk mining time"", and I mined them and bought them because I believed in LTC. 

Yeah I could sell out at the bottom for some BTC, but with the future being as ? as it is, that has an equal chance of being a really bad idea; whereas selling now, my 'recovery' would be laughable.

In short: the risk of holding isn't really outweighed by the ""benefit"" of cashing out this low.

If it goes much lower, i'll buy more.Go buy 1,000 litecoins, pretend you got robbed, and wait a few years.We have to go down before we can go up since the best thing anyone can do now is ride this wave, or [bubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anGXld-4hCA), out until bigger ones come later.Good, that means i can buy even more litecoins!whats the current cost to mine a ltc for large miners?Warren buffet...

2014-07-13 22:35:08;Branding by engineers...;"i agree that we should separate development from marketing.
we need a strong marketing team that works independently from the development team.
i don t feel that togami and coblee impose anything on the marketing, it is just that their influence remains strong, how strong depends on the passivity of the community.
so i support a strong litecoin association that works in the best interests of Litecoin.
if that association does not fulfill its mission, it should be discarded.So a couple weeks ago, saigoned PM'd me and asked me what logo I wanted to use for the video. I think I responded that although I preferred the current logo, the community can go with whatever logo they want. Then last week, when I saw the new proposed simple flat blue logo, I didn't really like it but was kind of OK with it. I didn't like the color. Thought it was too blue and would have preferred to keep silver in the logo. But it was under my impression that just like previous community logo decisions, the devs would choose their own logo and I planned to keep the current one or something similar. Then I saw a few threads about how this new logo will be the official Litecoin logo. That did not sit well with me. I realized that people actually thought this blue logo will be used everywhere including litecoin.org, litecoin.com, and the client. That's when I stepped in and put a pause to the logo decision.

I had to really think hard about whether or not we wanted to keep our association with silver. And I also wanted to know where people stood with respect to the old and the blue logo. So I made 2 polls about silver (people were split 50/50) and the logo design (people were 60% in favor of the new design). Unfortunately, voting on the forum is very flawed. I asked people to vote on the design and not the color and pretty much no one listened to that. The poll was not going to decide on the new logo. It was just giving me a good idea about where the community stands on the logo designs so that I can make a decision.

After talking to Warren and a bunch of people with the Litecoin Association, Warren and I decided that we had to quickly decide on the new logo for the client and litecoin.org. We also decided that we wanted to stick with something close to the original logo. We spent the last year building up this current brand and see no reason why we should throw it away.

In the end, I don't think the blue logo represents the Litecoin I created. It's not ""lite"" and it's not silver. Say what you want about me being an engineer and that I don't have a background in marketing and branding. I know that the original branding that I created is a huge reason why Litecoin is where it is today. Litecoin **did not** succeed because of my engineering efforts. Litecoin succeeded because of my branding and marketing efforts. I created a brand that resonated with people. The ""lite"" and silver analogy worked psychologically on various different levels. Silver being the 2nd medal to a gold medal convinced people that Litecoin should be #2 behind Bitcoin. The fact that silver and gold were the main 2 metals that were used as coinage in history convinced people that they should hold and support both Bitcoin and Litecoin because these are the 2 main crypto-currencies. The ""lite"" name reinforced the speed of Litecoin transactions. **These were not by accident!** I spent more time with branding than I did with coding before I launched Litecoin. So it is unfair to say that I know nothing about branding and should leave branding to experts.

The LA can decide to use the blue logo (or a different one) for LA projects. I have absolutely zero objections to that. Some people think that we need to have one logo period. I still am not convinced as we are not a company like Coke. We are a decentralized currency. Bitcoin has a lot of different logos. It's true that we are fighting a harder battle and having one branding can only help, but I don't think it's the end of the world if we have multiple Litecoin logos. In the end, you really can't control what people do. And we don't want to.I was very upset to hear this at the meeting today. This is permanently damaging to the Litecoin community. We may never be able to come together as a community again, after knowing our joint projects and hard work can be shut down in the blink of an eye.

It's very clear that The Litecoin Associate needs a restructuring in terms of what their role and goals are in the community, what they can and cannot change, what they are fully in control of.
This is insane. Some of us have been working part time - full time the past month brainstorming and developing strategies to organize and tap into this communities potential. 

The engineers are obviously not reading these posts on reddit because I have no idea how they couldn't empathize with the basic logic of it. They want a veto right? Arguable, but so it goes. But as far as choosing talent and developing a branded marketing strategy it's ridiculous. They spend their days working for the code of the coin which I have no idea how to begin to understand. We spend our days in creative and marketing based ventures into the stability of the coins profile. 

Could Charlie come and comment on this? Him and his team seem like decent guys and maybe there's been a misunderstanding or underestimation of how seriously the new creative marketing team is working on this. Would he like to speak to a representative for our team, or be given more direct updates? Does he see the recent awakening of the subreddit and the optimistic outlook being promoted and worked towards? I feel like we need to reach out to the engineers as soon as possible because if the creative team is completely ignored to the point of insult and stop contributing, I don't think it'll be anywhere near as easy (and it's been hard) to bring them back together again. Then coin marketing will be handled by hired talent who don't have the same intimate relationship with the community and the coin.  Link to litecointalk thread: https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=21100.0I don't understand.

1. Where is the post by Carnth that you're responding to?
2. Is Carnth a Litecoin dev?
3. What logo is Carnth trying to veto?[this gon be good](http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/227169i6165B99218F75ACB/image-size/original?v=mpbl-1&px=-1)[Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.](http://i.imgur.com/3pdaJaQ.png)

/u/FreeJack2k2. Please calm down.

I want you to realize 3 things:

* /u/coblee and the Dev team picked a logo.
* The logo they picked will be used in the next version of the Litecoin Software and on the litecoin.org official download website.
* The community **does not need to use the logo provided** and can create and use whatever they want. It will just be different than the software and official download website and our cross-branding unity will be non-existent.

Another thing that happened. The community has spent over a month trying to find a logo. Poll after confusing poll and a consensus has not be reached. We have said that the best thing to happen is someone in authority step in and just choose so we can move on. So, Charlie did. It's our choice if move on or continue to gripe about it. 

The Litecoin Association will be moving forward. The Video(s) will be re-done with the new logo and posted. The Litecoin.com website will use it. Merchant flyers will use it.
We are accomplishing great things. FreeJack, we still need your help as well.
I asked you to get behind making the next video, are you still going to work on that?
Marketing is one arm of the Litecoin Association's duties for Litecoin. ""Marketing Lead"" is a position that has yet to be filled. Who would you recommend for this volunteer position?This post is 100% on and I was happy to give you gold.  The community is a joke, the leadership is a joke, and the lack of value is reflected in the market.  There is low hanging fruit to be picked off by simply having competent marketing, but it seems the powers that be have other agendas.  Why would anyone in their right mind, with capital, invest in marketing Litecoin when they could control their own coin?  How many different ways can you put a circle around an L?Dear engineers, devs, LA,  FreeJack2k2, you really don't know how much respect I have for all of you (FreeJack2k2, I've pm out once about your posts).  I've been an early adopter of LTC, and lately a fan/ follower of FreeJack2k2 posts.
The funny thing here is that I can fully understand both ""points of view"", and believe it or not I agree with both. 
Maybe, somehow, we could all step back. Maybe we could even forget the logo for awhile and come back to it after e.g. a year.
I'd love to see FreeJack2k2 on board of the marketing campaign and why not a member of LA.
Still, devs devotion and consistency makes sure for the future of LTC.

I can tell, that both sides want to help in the ""moon"" direction for our little ""chickun"".

Here is another idea every coin has two sides. Why not have both logos on the official site and the campaigns? Or, can't we combine the bloody blue with the bloody silver?
Color might be important but, what is the most important part of the logo  -IMHO- is the ""L""

If LTC has managed to get to 50$ then I am sure we can sort things out for a strong LTC & Community

p.s. coblee & Freejack2k2 if you need help for translation in Greek PM me (just do not know where to apply)+/u/litetip 0.025 LTC Im a happy to see such passion in the litecoin community and the willingness to let your concerns be voiced and heard and also the willingness for working openly with everyone on the litecoin team.So you don't like the new logo?[deleted]All this angst over a new logo? Wow, this is pretty silly. Leave the logo alone and do something that will provide more impact. People aren't going to migrate to LTC because it's now blue. Just so silly."

* **Windows Key + Right Key**  
^(Same as above, except to the right)  

* **Windows Key + Up**

* **Cascade windows**  
^(Layers active windows one of top each other, like a pancake stack)

* **Show windows stacked**  
^(Stretches active windows fully horizontally then resizes vertically to fit a percentage of the screen)

* **Show windows side by side**  
^(Stretches active windows fully vertically then resizes horizontally to fit a percentage of the screen)  


**3. Restoring window positions, after multiple monitor reconfiguration**  

* Right click Desktop

* Click Screen Resolution

* Click Detect.

^(Desktop Window Manager should move all offscreen windows onto an available screen.)

You probably had multiple monitors plugged in and used it last on the monitor that's now unplugged. Google ""window off screen""Right click on your desktop --> Screen resolution --> See what settings it uses. If you see Multiple displays, change the dropdown to ""Show desktop on only x"" where x is the monitor you currently are on.  
If you're unsure which monitor you're on, click on the ""Identify"" button next to the monitor icon. Good luck!In addition to some others posted, the way I sometimes get back hidden windows is this:

* Use Alt-tab to make sure the window is active.
* Press Alt-space to open up the standard menu (restore, move, etc). You won't be able to see it open, but just have faith.
* Press M (for move).
* Use the arrow keys to try to get it back onto where you can see it. (After you've pressed at least 1 arrow key, try moving the mouse cursor and see if the window jumps to its location).
* Press enter to finish the move

2014-07-20 20:00:45;A new way to 'merge mine' dogecoin and litecoin but no fork needed (from r/dogecoin) - your thoughts?;"I really would be happier if we just kept Litecoin and Dogecoin separate. I do think the coin was funny, has a laid back community and was a cool experiment. However, coming from someone who is passionate about economics and crypto-currencies, I really would be happier if litecoin was not associated with it. It has an atrocious reward schedule, the hashing algorithm does not bring anything new, and as Charles Lee has stated, it fame relies heavily on an internet meme. 

I wish the best of luck to other shibes, but really think that dogecoin has run its course and no longer should be something that the litecoin community should be giving attention to. Unless I am extremely confused by what he's trying to do, I think it cannot work.

In brief: merge mining is accomplished by the ""child coin"" accepting solutions that ""look like solutions for the parent coin"".

***

Let's say you have:

* Litecoin (parent) -> Somecoin (child)  
i.e. Somecoin can accept Litecoin block headers as solutions

And also:

* Dogecoin (parent) -> Somecoin (child)  
i.e. Somecoin can also accept Dogecoin block headers as solutions

***

That means you can choose to mine:

1. Litecoin alone
2. Litecoin with Somecoin
3. Dogecoin alone
4. Dogecoin with Somecoin

***
But you cannot mine Litecoin and Dogecoin together by virtue of mining Somecoin[deleted]I left my comment on that thread, I'm personally confused on the proposal

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2b86sz/let_me_explain_merged_mining_how_i_would_do_it/cj2v9y6It's an interesting idea, but doesn't sound right... if it is possible, why hasn't someone done it before?  You'd be increasing your mining payout dramatically, and effectively kill all the new altcoins because everyone would be mining them without giving up on their coin of choice.

I don't think that you can have 2 parent coins to one child coin without sacrificing something.Litecoin is in a comanding position, why dose this make sense. Also doge coin is currently worthless and its whole goal is to be worthless. Ltc is not why would we switch.
"
2014-07-20 19:14:56;Am i the only one who doesn't understand why the merged mining is being pushed so hard?;"Charlie is a Shibe, too. I don't think LTC is his only concern.Dogecoin has a hold on the public eye as a cryptocurrency. If Dogecoin dies, the public will view cryptocurrencies as an incredibly dangerous asset to have. They'll have less trust of cryptos and would be even more unlikely to get/hold cryptos in the near future. This impacts Litecoin.

Also, Litecoin could use some association with Dogecoin in branding.I am writing a paper on this that I plan to share with both communities. But what most people here have said is correct, the death of Dogecoin would have a more significant impact in the entire crypto ecosystem than people realize. A coin as popular as doge dieing doesn't look good for Cryptos in general. They have a better colour scheme on their sub though to be fair.Aslong as someone is keeping atleast one cleint open it cannot die, but a 51% attack on doge coin will be bad pressI understand why people fear it dying but it was designed as a joke. Letting it die might be bad but... saving by taking others down at the same time would be worse.I think it's also a case of two plus two being five. Not only does dogecoin gain the hash-power of current litecoin miners, but litecoin gains power from existing dogecoin-only miners.

2014-07-27 05:06:03;ASICs impact on Litecoin;"""The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost"" -SatoshiIt isn't going to be instant. There isn't a 1:1 correlation with ASICs being released and the price rising.

ASICs cost money, miners want return on investment. When there is nowhere else for the hashrate to profitably go, it will stay with Litecoin. When the price of the coin makes it unprofitable, miners start to hoard what they mine. This stems the flow of new coin onto the markets. A result of the network strengthening to this degree is that more people take it seriously and will become interested in supporting it...whether products and services, merchant adoption or otherwise. Increased interest drives new demand. New demand without new supply means the price of the coin in circulation rises, until mining is profitable again.

It's not, ""ASICS are here, let's have that price increase!"" It is part of a bigger picture and it's just getting started. Look toward the end of this year...not the near term. Right now it's in transition...and there is an abnormal concentration of hashrate into the hands of a few miners, who have been dumping as fast as they mine...most likely scrambling to pay off their hardware before the next generation ships.The creation of ASICs for Litecoin eliminated any differences it has over Bitcoin. As of now Litecoin is nothing more than a clonecoin because the devs refuse to do anything about ASICs. Planning on dumping my coins soon.The selling presure is huge but from an investor point of view it provide liquidity and a great price entry point. What other coin is protected by its own dedicated hardware and how did it play out ? Although we are seeing very low prices, the future looks bright for LTC. Give it few more month for some spectacular price action.Hash rate doesn't drive price.  Take the last 6 months of hash rate gains, and overlay it on a chart of LTC; they're going in the opposite direction.  This immediately should make you question the logic that ASICs by themselves can rescue Litecoin.

The integrity of the network lies in the cost to attack the network, not the hash rate by itself in a vacuum.  If the hash rate and difficulty went up, but the cost per hash went down because of declining cost per hash from ASICs, then it's hard to argue that the network is inherently more secure.  It may or may not be even less secure, because ASICs tend to centralize hashing power and increase the possibility of collusion.

The best way to think about hash rate and ASICs I think is just as a prerequisite or a risk hurdle.  Basically the hash rate needs to reach a minimum point where a few persons acting irrationally cannot compromise the network, and after that we see diminishing returns.  In my opinion, we passed this point a long time ago; the next big boost to confidence would be if it became difficult for the network to be attacked even by a ultra-rich actor like a sovereign government, but let's face it even Bitcoin isn't at that point yet and Litecoin may never reach it.  Also remember that 51% attacks are not very lucrative, so we're also probably past the point of one being financially motivated by a rational actor.  Finally just ask yourself the basic question, how many people are on the sidelines saying to themselves how they would love to invest in Litecoin if only the network were more secure?  It seems to me not that many.

I personally feel BTC is a better investment right now, I don't see a lot of new money floating around in LTC, so the only way it'll get massively pumped from here is if there's a lot of profit taking after a big run up in BTC, and those profits get thrown into LTC from seasoned traders - basically what happened last November.i believe that LTC will easily pass the last all time high price $49 when the next rally begins. it will go beyond $100... it is inevitable. it just needs time.We think some people manipulating value Litecoin in ( Forex ), big seller and buy in the word this actions affect others in the value of Litecoin. They do some people and can be seen in the transaction log that (Forex). We think that is why it is our opinion and can enter LitecoinPR in Twitter to find some information there. It's free and not have to lose. Just read and you can see the value manipulation. Since orders placed in small fractions purchase Litecoin followed accordingly to achieve different values ââhold a value of Litecoin very low and do not allow the market to determine the value for their own impact. 

But it is a value determined by those people causing a negative domino effect in the form of the other markets. And we think they do with every intention and no stop that practice those affecting the value of Litecoin market negatively. 

We think that the value for the cost of producing the Litecoin should be increased to 
$60.00USD per Litecoin amount. It is estimated between what it costs to create a Litecoin currency, the cost of equipment, the cost of the light required to pay to produce the currency and the profit which must be sold. 

But to manipulate the value in (Forex), the miner thinks Litecoin may not sell the currency at actual value, which is the cost of producing it, the cost of equipment to produce and gain you should get the person for their production Litecoin and the fee charged by the (Forex) by buying and selling the currency and transfer the money to your account. 

Then the miner sells the value manipulated by some people and that causes a cascading effect on the value of the sale of Litecoin as it has no real market value. 

This differs from the Bitcoin. Importantly, our review is only about the current value and the consequences Litecoin why right now is very low in the market. It might be wrong but we think it is right what explain here. 

Thank you for your attention.Unlike BTC, these ASICs are early in LTC's life. Is there a larger centralization issue here due to us being still early in the mining process? This might not be bad financially though, as big money might be able to get more of a position here.
Thoughts?It is a logical consequence that the price has fallen because the production cost decreased a lot verses GPU's. ASIC's are way more efficient. If you have modern machinery you have an edge over the concurrence and can go to market at a better price. Difficulty must rise a lot. Litecoin is an intangible good and 3/4 of all cost combined is for generating (making) the commodity.  it will come in due time.The price will be affected for another couple of months until more manufacturers start to ship their ASICS and there isn't a small number of miners dumping huge numbers of Litecoin onto the markets. 

We aren't there yet but it will come.  If the price doesn't move by Christmas, then you should worry.ACICS can only raise the price!"
2014-07-27 03:27:29;Litecoin should take advantage of it's market share, and implement as much as possible.;"This ""feature fever"" that has gripped the crypto-currency community is ludicrous, in my view. The average consumer wants four main things with money: Security, reliability, speed and ease of use. We've got the first three handled, the fourth one is the ""iTunes/iPod moment"" that still needs to emerge.

Building anonymity into the protocol only ensures it'll never achieve mainstream adoption anywhere...it'll be vilified. I personally dislike proof of stake, it has major problems - just look at what happened with Vericoin.

Litecoin has no trouble keeping the smaller coins ""at bay."" Nothing is even within  spitting distance of it.Litecoin is not changing our PoW and hard forking. PoS is very bad right now because of its own issues (look at minipal's hack forcing vericoin to fork to a previous time).


As freejack said, this ""feature fever"" needs to stop. There is nothing wrong with Litecoin, the sky isn't falling, and just because the price is down now doesnt mean the developers need to rush and get something untested implemented that could shatter the entire Litecoin economy. 

We are in a transitional period, something only one other PoW has ever seen and only really 1 coin dominating the market has ever been through (Bitcoin). We are the dominant Scrypt coin right now, and the most successful ""alt"" coin out there (right now I firmly believe we are no longer considered an alt honestly). So things are going well for us and we do not need some wizz bang feature.I agree. It needs a way to separate itself. Bitcoin has flaws. Let's not have the same flaws.

This is a win for scypt base algos.According to /u/langer_hans they are not merge mining with litecoin, they are merge mining with the Scrypt coin which has the highest hashrate which just happens to be litecoin at this present time.maybe now it get some value back, they age good guys they deserve itCould someone please explain what this means for Litecoin? Is a hard fork for Litecoin required if merged mining is implemented?

 Any pools known to be on board or announcing they will support this?it will be interesting to see which group has the most sell pressure....selling litecoin to get more doge, or selling doge to get more litecoin.I'm glad that Dogecoin is getting a better protection, anything but a 51% disaster is good at this point. But not giving back credits is so uncool. They use the same algo, they will benefit the same massive hashrate and, sorry to say but, without 2 big public kicks in the butt to provoke a debate...
Calling it it AuxPOW instead of merge mining ? ok. Doing everything to never mention Litecoin or the less possible ? nice. Saying ""Dogecoin will ACCEPT other POW blocks""...your magnificient holiness is too good for us simple random ""lucky to have the strongest network"" litecoiners. Let me do that for you :""I am glad that the Dogecoin network will help securing the Litecoin network, Litecoin was in deep troubles without the help of Dogecoin pools and AuxPOW"". Thank you Dogecoin devs for all the good vibrations and help you bring to the scrypt familly.I love how they still dont want to give in and say that is merged with litecoin LOL. I mean really, are they blind call it what you want there is no difference from straight merge. When a handful of developers can choose to make such a drastic change your decentralised currency is worthless - this is centralisation of the worst kind. No legal oversight, no community oversight, no accountability of any kind.

If the Bitcoin dev's tried this it would invalidate all the ASIC investments people had already made, as a result the dev's would be playing on a fork all on their own because no one would join them.

If Dogecoin's dev's have this much control over the currency the writing is on the wall for it.....ouch. Goodby DogecoinDon't merge, just kill it with a 51% attack and put doge out of its misery.By letting me spend mined doge for electricity,   and not having to touch my ltcAnd Scrypt multipools will now become even more profitable, by the way! If AuxPoW works as advertised, they can mine basically anything profitable plus Doge at the same time.decent infoLitecoiners made this masterplan back in february when doge gained value and attention. The name of the masterplan was:

""How to use dogecoin for our success.""

The night of 28. february, Charlie Lee, Jackson Palmer and Patrick Bateman agreed, that dogecoin will be used as a tool for achieving total supremacy of litecoin.

The ASIC manufactuers supported this masterplan, because they knew a lot of newcommers will be manipualtoed into buyning useless ASIC miners. Now we are in final stage of the masterplan. AuxPow. They told masses it measn merged mining with any script coin, but in reality it means only fussion with litecoin and loss of a brand known as... dogecoin. Yes, thsi si teh truth ladeis and gentlemen, the ugly, the only truth.

So here it is, I cant be silent about it anymore! I knwo that the Charlie Lee's assassins will come for me, but I ready. I'm ready, you hear me! I was a straw man, I signed receivables so peopkle behind master plan remained clean. But today its the day, the truth will be known!

BTC Chinaâs official mobile wallet Picasso that merchants are using in their daily business accepting bitcoin/litecoin payments. Picasso aims to provide a worldwide service, as it supports eight major currencies and offers ten languages.


The real reason why bitpay is only bitcoin is simple. The owners of the Corp are all big bagholders of BTC and they think they will weaken BTC price if they support alts like LTC. 

But don't let such anti-competitive mentality ruin your day. In all (mature) markets there are always ""two giants"". Crypto currency is by far ""mature"" yet. The second giant is yet to show his presence. 

LTC does have a great chance of being this second giant sometime in the future. Just gotta let the market mature naturally. These big macro sized wheels move slow. But they are moving. Just takes skill and (lots of) patience to notice it. Litecoin is still first and foremost speculation, much more so than bitcoin, whether the community likes it or not. It's going to take some major break through for merchants and payment processors to see value in accepting and start taking seriously Litecoin as well as Bitcoin. Litecoin is just not there yet.Yes, Litecoin is still in speculation fase, but the payment processors which is accepting litecoin is growing.

If LTC had BTC's market cap it would be accepted in close to as many places. In most consumer retail transactions, zero-confirmation is the standard; 2.5 minutes might as well be 10 minutes, because anything over 5 seconds is simply too long. In larger transactions like buying a car, or B2B supply chain purchases, or online purchases where shipping an item is involved, well then you'll be waiting 20-30 minutes for enough confirmations regardless of which coin is used. 

It's also worth pointing out that Bitpay and major merchant processors typically setup listening nodes that increase their confidence in zero-conf transactions.  There are also multi-sig wallets, greenaddresses, trusted off-chain transactions, all of which can facilitate instant verification in Bitcoin.

The hard truth is that in the majority of practical applications, Litecoin is no faster than Bitcoin; they are essentially the same thing.Entire article is a straw man yeah

Where are you getting those graphs from?

2014-08-17 22:31:18;Is it possible to fix this error with my wallet?;"salvagewallet command is your safest bet.

You will need to run the command alongside litecoin-qt.exe, one possible way is to right click on the litecoin software shortcut/icon and click on ""properties"".

Append ""--salvagewallet"" to the value of ""target"".

For example, if the ""target"" value is 

>""C:\Program Files (x86)\Litecoin\litecoin-qt.exe""

make it

> ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Litecoin\litecoin-qt.exe"" --salvagewallet

Then click ""apply"" and the start the litecoin software.

Now you will have 2 wallets in your ""\AppData\Roaming\Litecoin"" folder, 

One ending in .bak and one ending in .dat. .bat is your corrupted wallet file and .dat is your new one preloaded with your old private keys/litecoins.

Now you wait for your wallet to synchronize with the network.

Also remember to remove the ""--salvagewallet"" before restarting litecoin.And my wallet does work perfectly fine using a clean wallet.dat file.Try importing your old wallet.dat file into the Qt wallet but perhaps on another machine. Although from your description, it seems as thought the .dat file is corrupted.

Are you kidding?  

We have an incoming reward half next august, and we have the hash power to 51% ALL scrypt alts.  

We'll be fine.No, I have not. Although I bought in heavily at 34.5 and have daytraded my average cost to 30.8 -- LTC is currently between 25 and 27 so needless to say I am down around 10% in a short time. Nothing will make me sell permanently, I may trade in and out of LTC and CNY when I think the charts are favorable but I invested knowing this is a high risk, high reward asset.

Ask yourself this -- how much better known are cryptocurrencies and how much more secure is the LTC network compared to 2013? A lot more, in my opinion. In 2013 the ""stable"" pre-bubble range was $1.50 each and that was with a lot less acceptance and knowledge. This tells me, at worst, the downside from $4.50 is to $1.50 (there's no way you'll convince me LTC is worth less than it was pre-bubble 2013). The upside, as we all know, is $30+ each. That's a chance I'm willing to take to longterm hold.I held litecoin throughout most of 2013 but sold all my LTC around $25 in January as Charlie hinted towards it being in a bubble:

http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1ub48z/charlie_lee_thinks_ltc_is_in_a_bubble/

Of course I was downvoted to hell, but look who was right after all. 

Next time take heed of such subtle cues. stilll hodlin , never sold crypto for fiat and never will..I sold some at $0.70 / $40  / $32  / $20  / $12  / Holding the rest.I've mined and bought litecoin 2 years ago when the price was $1+ and held it ever since. Im going long on litecoin and will never sell it before 2016Hodling since 10cents. Sold a few around 25$. Bought a few more now. I'm a strong believer/ supporter of LTC (&BTC). Also, I agree with FreeJack2k2's posts about mining etc etcI won't be selling. I bought with a three year outlook and resolved not to sell (unless I had no alternative) in that entire three years, until the landscape had some time to sort out.

There is a long way to go before the history of the world's adoption of digital currencies can be written. I have a ton of faith in Litecoin.Every coin goes through this cycle. For bitcoin it was back in June 2011, where the price dropped from 32 to 2. Litecoin is going through this phase right now. If it were to follow exactly, the price would bottom out at $3 from $48. We're not very far from this, at $4. My analysis indicates it could go a heck of a lot higher than that. So imo with litecoin there is huge upside potential with very little downside risk. Litecoin is perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last eight months.Sold at 43 and 19 then reboughht at 7.50, 6.90 and recently $5.... Not really happy with my decision because I hate bagholding... Luckily it was only ~1btc worthive sold aroudn 200 at 6USD but thats not even 50% of my stuff.. i regret now a bitBuying all the way down :)Still holding and going to hold till 2018 what ever happens.

I've bought GPU for gaming, found out about BTC/LTC before people went crazy last year, mined for few months. Got successfully scammed for a half of what I had, don't have that much now, so I am not even bothered by trading to maximize.

2014-08-31 21:33:05;Why is bitcoin more popular and worth more per coin than litecoin?;"First-Mover AdvantageSimply put, they are the first.

The crypto movement is still very young, and it is no where near main adoption or even early adoption. The one who is normally the first in any large movement will be the most well known, but doesnt always mean that they will be the best (myspace, napster, etc).

In addition, there are market forces at work. The more of a coin there are out there, naturally more people will have it therefore the price will be lower. So unless there is such a significant mass adoption for Litecoin and near zero for Bitcoin, Litecoin should expect at best 1/4 worth of Bitcoin (standard adoption on both coins).Bitcoin came first, and it has the most support. There are tons of new coins out there, many of them with better ""features"" than Litecoin. So far, none of those features have mattered enough to gain more support than Litecoin, let alone Bitcoin. The only reason Litecoin is #2 instead of something else is because it's been established as #2 for a long time. This is the same reason that Bitcoin sits as #1. Because just like in UFC you're gonna want to ""be first""Mainly because it had a two year head start.  Bitcoin isn't superior in any way but those extra two years really gave it the network effect that it has today.

I strongly believe that had Charlie Lee created Litecoin 6 months after the creation of bitcoin (instead of 2 years)  then Litecoin would be the number one crypto in the world right now.  There is little doubt about that.>Why is bitcoin worth more per coin than litecoin?

Because there are fewer bitcoinsBecause bitcoin actually has development going on, and companies like bitpay coinbase and blockchain are helping bring it to the masses. 

What has litecoin done other than price speculate?Because they created a religion out of it.CocaCola to Pepsi & also what Cab000se says, unfortunately. It's first and has less coins. All development and services are also happening for Bitcoin. Bitcoin started it all and is true innovation.Because.[deleted]"
2014-08-31 15:00:02;With Hashlets selling so well, why has the network hash rate not increased at all?;"It's simple...that hashrate was added to the network back in late May and early June. They have been dumping Litecoin since they started, building up a stockpile of Bitcoin in the process.Maybe they haven't actually turned anything on yet. Maybe the payouts are just a fraction of the $16 or whatever people paid for Hashlets.The thing is they already had the hashing power up. They just decided to sell it using the hashlet as a way to distribute the hashes. Think cex.io. Just because someone buys one gh/s doesn't mean the network goes up that much. They just start receiving the payout vs. the pool keeping the payout for themselves. I think these GAWminer hashlets are nothing but a scam.because theses ""machines"" have been online for quite some time already !Hashlets are based on ZeusMiner systems. ZeusMiner began delivering capacity months ago, which resulted in the astronomic increase in difficulty. They bought & dumped coins on the market until the ROI of a cloud-based service surpassed that of simply buying & dumping. Now that the time has come, they've released these ""Hashlets"". The capacity has been there. They are just taking fiat for it now instead of cashing in the LTC at the various exchanges.The Hashlets all point to their own pool, which is a multipool. There are currently other scrypt coins with better profitability than Litecoin, so they are all mining another coin. It's either that or the Ponzi theory.You certain their mining LTC? There are plenty of alt's with better Revenue /
Profit (per day). http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrencyThey aren't miners.

P.S. Hashlets have to be a ponzi scheme...they were cheap day one..now they jump in price...then they jump in price again...just saying...I read on Hashtalk that GAWs CEO is actually concerned about it, and thats the main reason why he put up hashlets more expensive.      

They are aware of this, but in this business you got do what you gotta do to survive!             

I personally have a few Hashlets, bought them when they came out, i am big DOGE supporter, but i also support GAWminers and making a post about telling people not to buy from them will not solve things!           

What happens if GAW stops selling their hashlets, will the alt Coins prices go up? MAYBE, but if they dont dump the coins then the miners will, most people mining dont really care about Scrypt, they are in it for the profits!                


I am fairly new to Cryptos but i believe its not the hashlets killing the coins, its ASICs overall, but thats just my 2 satoshis

So very much.Yes and thats why it should trade at it's naturally (ie scarcity) implied exchange rate to btc, 4 litecoins to 1 bitcoin.[removed]> Litecoin's 30 day trading volume globally, as measured in USD, is 83.5% of Bitcoin's.

> [...]

> Litecoin's codebase is essentially the same thing as Bitcoin's, and it has near equivalent liquidity.

Uhm, I never studied economics, but aren't these two different concepts?

Having a roughly equivalent amount of dollars traded does not necessarily imply having a roughly equivalent liquidity.

For example, if the volume of BTC traded were 1% of the volume of BTC available for trading while the volume of LTC traded were 10% of the volume of LTC available for trading, wouldn't their liquidity be very different even if their traded volume were identical?  
(Because then it would be much ""easier"" to sell/buy BTC quickly without reducing/increasing the price)

So maybe you need more data to compare their ""liquidity"".96.5% of that volume comes from China, and the majority of that from OKCoin, which is a flawed source because of their [VIP rewards program](http://imgur.com/QBRCgfN) that encourages traders to create meaningless net neutral, zero-fee trades with themselves in order to gain access to lower withdrawal fees and higher borrowing limits.  Thus at least a good portion of this volume has no actual functional utility because it appears and disappears instantly from the orderbooks... how much exactly is hard to say.

When looking only at USD exchanges, Litecoin is about 15% of Bitcoin's volume over 30-days.  Of course, Bitcoinwisdom is excluding some important exchanges here like itbit and lakebtc, also the volume for Coinbase appears to be not known and therefore not included, they are only using it for the average price.

Is Litecoin the 2nd most liquid crypto asset today?  Of course, I don't think anybody is questioning that.  The question is, do we need a Bitcoin clone / backup?  It's becoming increasingly clear that we probably don't, and that selling the mainstream market on Bitcoin is already proving to be quite hard... That's what the 1% market valuation is based on, I think.  There is a very large discount for the risk that mainstream society will ignore it, even if daytraders like it.

P.S. Some important Chinese alt exchanges like btc38 are missing from bitcoinwisdom.  Also, I think it's a bit unfair to compare fee-based exchanges to zero-fee exchanges especially with how war bots work.well damn.  Then soon it will be time to dump."

The ltc wiki has definitely stood out to me as something that, even just in the text, isn't representing itself as a stand alone coin that exists in its own right. ""Inspired by and nearly identical to Bitcoin"" is cringeworthy, at least for me, coming from the branding cave. "
2014-09-21 03:38:40;One important aspect of Litecoin is definitively to be the digital silver.;"I'm glad we've got the silver analogy. It's a really genius branding technique that has done enormously well for us.I don't think silver is beneficial in the long run, though, as it reinforces the runner up idea in people's minds, especially newcomers to the crypto scene. I prefer silver to gold personally, but gold is the ideal for many. Maybe Litecoin should adopt the idea of being the platinum to Bitcoin's gold. :)nice roundThat thing is round and shiny. I want some!Guys, I know even glimpses of the marketing effort have not been shown yet, but there really are things in the works. 

One aspect that we're really solid on is our identity, and, because I feel like you're trying to start an argument by not even considering some of the points the marketing team has listed here in response to the silver argument several times before, I'm not going to bring it up again. 

With that said, I think you should realize that we're on to something and despite your adamant stance on silver, we feel it's not in the best efforts of litecoin as an individual entity. Litecoin needs to stand alone, not in relation to another brand. 

The silver analogy really is a good idea and was a good idea, seriously. The thing is though is you're lumping today's interest in the coin with tomorrow's public interest in the coin. Today, silver means ""chance of surviving."" Tomorrow, silver means ""rating of quality."" The important thing to note is that today's public is a spec compared to tomorrow's public. 

Even if you take that away, you're still comparing litecoin to silver. Even if you were comparing it to gold, it wouldn't be strong enough. It should stand on it's own in terms of its identity. Even shiny metals have a finite lifeline of when they became a symbol of value. As crazy as it sounds, we have to give litecoin that ability to grow to be stronger than anything. Whether you compare it to gold, or garbage, you're still comparing it to too direct of an object. We're trying to put it on a level that other, weaker campaigns will compare their items to and make analogies of. "

If anyone thinks this company is actually legitimate and has a product to sell then I have a nice beach front property in Arizona I would like to sell them.  Warning flags:

1. Their 'office' has been empty and unused since the beginning.
2. Fake pictures or fabricated pictures of their products.
3. Most likely ran by one person with multiple personalities.  'Liroy'  really?
4. June delivery, moved to September, moved to October, ad infinitum.
5. Whatever product they are trying to put out into the market is not profitable anymore as there are cheaper products out there.  

It's a scam or the money is probably being used to fund ISIS or female circumcision.  
>Damages can often be claimed above and beyond the original purchase price due to lost income, accrued interest and perhaps even impact on health due to stress.

Yea , that last line in your post is correct. This isnt legal advice. 

Where the hell do you live that you think you can sue someone and recover ""lost profit"" ?? Thats just fucking insane. 

Charge back on card. MoneyClaim Online otherwise. With proof u requested refund and that they said no or didn't respond with a valid reason.Its a shame that my initial worries about Alpha Tech (http://thedailywallet.com/100/the-first-litecoin-asic-alpha-technology - 24th Dec 2013) - seem to be true.

It seemed very risky to me at the time that the company had no experience, nor financial backing - so the entire creation/through development of a new type of ASIC (one that is far more complicated) was going to be entirely funded by customer orders - as well as presumably their own wages/rent/office costs, bills and so forth.If you paid via Paypal you can call (Don't E-mail) and tell Paypal they have not delivered on the product.  Even with it being past 45 days you can still lodge a complaint.  Alpha has stated they paypal was withholding funds.  If this is true then there is still a chance down the line you may get your money back.  Slim I know but if they get enough people calling about fraud they may not pay Alpha out.
I don't think this comes under false advertising unless they knew they couldn't meet the deadline.  You would have to prove they had no intention to deliver the goods and not just that they are running late, as happens to projects and builds like they offer.  I think people are clutching at straws to get their money back now they've realised they will never make ROI and have made a bad purchasing decision.Bring it up with the FTC. With the bfl case they may be open to investigating similar prepaid-no-delivery schemes especially if the prepaid amounts are used for salary and personal expenses and not r&d and manufacturing
  
The intent behind this is stir up criminal liability if they had no ability to produce (bfl to their credit at least produced a low quality item)[deleted]You mean their [loyalty scheme](https://alpha-t.net/loyalty-scheme-rules/) doesn't seem fair?!  

It's a slow motion train wreck.....There will be no real vipers delivered. They are the biggest scam merchants I've ever come across.  Feel very sorry for those that have lost money with them. Yeah I got some thoughts, why are you posting about this scam company in this sub? This is not news to anyone who did ten minutes of research. You will either never receive your product or it will come so late that it's obsolete. I don't feel bad for anyone who purchased from them, they are literally following step by step what BFL did. The only sliver lining is that BFL is being investigated and those people will spend long jail terms. Hopefully the assholes at Alpha Tech will have a similar ending. 


They took your money, built enough rigs to mine for them selves. Fed you bullshit. You gladly are it. Used more preorder money to live it up. Fed you more bullshit. Used the next wave to help produce the first wave of ""product"" because they blew all that cash. Eventually they will send you the rigs when ROI's impossible. You will notice dush and other issues. It will break in 2 months. The end."

In any case, in this discussion thread, the CEO of OKcoin wrote in vehemently denying that it is in collusion with other Chinese exchanges to manipulate prices. Dunno about Huobi or BTC-china. True that it would put him out of business to do this crap and get caught, but then again if these exchanges don't charge trading fees, then how exactly do they make money except by entering into shady practices like this?

What does coblee have to say about this? /u/coblee please ask your brother what's going onThis sounds like a fractional reserve bitcoin and litecoin scheme..  So in theory there is less litecoins and if enough people withdrawal from the exchanges, prices should skyrocket
Moving towards completely open source and transparent exchanges would be keeping in the spirit of bitcoin and other open source currencies. The exchanges should be just like bitcoin in that their code is available to view and their back-end operations totally public. It's as if currency needs a large governing body to be stable...Reposted over in litecointalk.org, thanks for the read :)."

As far as I'm concerned LTC is at a fuckin steal of a price and I believe it won't last much longer. The economic news the US gov has is puttin out is all fake and its about to go bust(and they know it too).

That will change as both BTC and LTC go mainstream, but until your grandma uses it to buy her six-pack and Hustler, there will only be whales. The good news is a pump must be coming before year end. I 100% believe that there will be a reversal. But this is just a hunch... No actual data. What is your onion based on? Yes, but what will happen to the price of pogs?my guess is that we would be seeing a baton change between btc an ltc.
btc network will get weaker (miners leaving) and ltc network will get stronger (new miners joining)

2014-10-19 19:28:01;Litecoin's 1w chart looks awesome! October 2013 rerun by next week?;"This is what I've been telling everyone. Hold on to your hats (and your LTC) as the MACD turns green. Now that shorting is allowed it may go even higher due to 1) we are starting 4x higher than last year and 2) short squeezing will cause intense buying pressure as the shorts are forced to cover.

Edit: I don't think the candlestick will turn green until Friday because the entire week needs to be averaged first. Don't know when the buy signal is generated for the bots to do their thang.I dont think we are going anywhere in the short term. That said, if you havent bought already, now is the perfect time to get in because once we leave these levels we will probably never seen them again. Hope so, its been getting boring :DI understand it as the long term TA suggests that LTC's price is not mostly going down as it may have hit the floor (supply and demand are at equilibrium at this price-- $4). But how it will progress next- abruptly like last bubble ($3-$48 in two weeks) then settle down to a higher level. Or, we will see a gradual progress (say, 6-8-12----25).

If I am correct last bubble was initiated by Chinese Investors rush-in and ""willy bot"" by MtGox and since then it is declining. I guess that BTC has hit bottom, as new coins may not be profitable to be sold below $350-370 due to [mining cost](http://imgur.com/cph9ZPk). Same may be true for Litecoin.

Since the last bubble BTC and LTC's infrastructure have been improved tremendously. Now my question is what will trigger next bubble or, gradual progress-- Will not it be next willy bot? Will not Indian investors rush in? Will not a butterfly effect that changes mind of Crypto investors from bear to bull suddenly? Will not be a big economic turmoil (like Cyprus)? Then what else fundamental?You mean the October run that was fuelled entirely by Bitcoin? Litecoin isn't going to detatch itself until there's a reason, and at the moment - there just isn't."
2014-10-19 17:41:16;Litecoin.com Update?;"yep we need somebody to just call the shootsI know that there has to be some marketing work finalized before putting the final Litecoin.com in place, but I am surprised there hasn't been any marketing material come out. Tick tock... tick tock... :)Seriously there have been lots of people submitting stuff (like artwork for new splash page) and website ideas.  The guys on the forums set dates then just ignore the people trying to contribute. 

Its frustrating as hell, the website looks like shit and there have been offers from multiple people to update it.   Problem is these guys dont know good design when they see it.  The new artwork for the splash screen looks like a 14yr old script kiddie has had a go.

There are better teams out there now that are working on other coins.  These guys need to stop being so relaxed about litecoins 'set' future and push forward.  Complacency is going to be the end of this coin.The problem is in organization, segregation, and structure.   

Back when we had the logo re-design competition in May, no one could come to an agreement on anything. Everyone had a different vision. No one liked any of the logos people designed. And it was a giant mess. Even as far as the Devs saying that they are under no obligation to use the community chosen logo in the new core splash screen and websites. Which really took a lot of power away from the Litecoin Association and community.. From there, a group of people split off and re-organized on Trello to design the litecoin.com website and come up with a new logo. Which, if I'm correct, would ONLY be considered for use and implemented if the Litecoin Association liked it and approved it... I vaguely keep up on the Trello projects and as for as a am aware, there is still a group very actively working there. My opinion of the Trello group is that they are taking on more than they can chew. Not only do they want to update litecoin.com and the litecoin logo, but they want to launch a giant marketing campaign and have their designs and vision standardized across all of Litecoin. In between doing all of this, they also discussed redesigning and updating the litecoin electrum site. I don't want to put them down, because they are really great guys, have amazing opinions and perspective, and are dedicated to their project. But bottom line is that they are trying to do too much.

The next segregation problem comes from litecoin.org, litecoin.com, litecoin.info, and litecoinassociation.org. I'm not sure who works on which sites, but they aren't overseen by anyone... At least the design process isn't. What is happening is that every developer/designer is working on the sites with little to no oversight. Because these groups don't work together, they want their site to be the 'one stop shop' for everything Litecoin. It should not be this way. Every site should have a specific purpose. And every person helping out should have a specific duty.

In my opinion, everything needs to be structured and everyone helping out should only have say in a small section.  

For example, Core devs should have say in coding the client and be able to update/re-design litecoin.org as they please, but they should not have the power to turn down a logo that the community chose. They need to use the chosen logo in the core client and on litecoin.org. :itecoin.org should be devoted to dev stuff ONLY. Basically just links to new client releases and links to Github, IRC channels, litecointalk.org link etc. But every other design choice between the client and .org site can be free for them to do as they please.

Speaking briefly about the other sites, Litecoin.com needs to be focused on consumer and merchant support/adoption. Litecoinassociation.org needs to be focused on detailing what the Litecoin Association does and provide news on what we are working on. And litecoin.info needs to be focused on guides of how to compile the client, console commands for the client, how to back up wallets, and other nerdy documentation.

Like I said, right now no one is really following this structure when they design a website for us. Not one really does anyone would specific thing. Everyone has an opinion about everything. And it all just is destined to fail..There are no updates at this time unfortunately. There are a lot of things in flux right now behind the scenes. Hopefully I/someone will be able to provide an update on this within the next few weeks."

2014-11-08 19:30:31;Litecoin vs. Bitcoin trend timing;"One more thing that I'd like to share with you guys. Yes, I was calling the bottom here some time ago around 24-25 yuan mark but obviously wrong. So make your own mind about my ""analysis"". Personally waiting for one better opportunity to change some bitcoins into litecoin.Yes, I think the right time is coming soon, it will  be below .01. I am looking to get in around .0085-.0095 but I will prob only buy a little around there and buy more if we get a new bottom. Regardless, I think the 11 month downtrend for btc may be finally over, and we should see a rally in the ratio soon enough. I've been noticing this for a while. Blue and red have kissed, now it's time for them to do the nasty. I say it's imminent.sooo time to buy maybe???I wonder if LTC/USD BTC/USD have decoupled from one another..? What makes you think LTC will go up with BTC in the same manner as before if Bitcoin enters another hyperbole towards the moon? The crypto landscape has changed quite a bit since the last bubbles, now alternatives to Bitcoin exist that offer real additional value, while Litecoin remains quite dull a DoppelgÃ¤nger of Bitcoin (dont wanna insult anybody, but if there is much more competition on now, then before)."
2014-11-08 17:43:50;Why does anyone have any interest in litecoin?;"I would like to add another points on the top of points that others have given- Bitcoin is costly, slow and rare, so not good for everyday transactions but good for storage (like Gold coins of earlier days, people like to hoard it, even Kings had executed people for hoarding). LTC is more of supply, fast and cheaper; more suitable for everyday transactions like Silver (Silver was later time the most prevalent currency before fiat system). Now why not other cheaper, faster coins are considered to be better-- JUST think of IRON as currency which never happened.Tons of reasons. If Bitcoin's network were compromised, there is Litecoin...equally strong, running on a completely separate network of hardware and algorithm. Satoshi has a million Bitcoin he mined during the first year...that's 5% of the lifetime supply. Another good reason to have an option.

Why have more than one credit card type? More than one of any kind of thing? Choice.I was recently trading PM's with someone on Bitcointalk about Litecoin itself, I think one of my PM's is very appropriate here (this is unedited, so it may be missing some context).

***

You need to think of it this way, Litecoin is really in a league of its own. It's not the sexiest coin, and it doesnt blow the lid off of other alts, but Litecoin has something that only Bitcoin has, which is trust and age.


When I say league of it's own its like this, Litecoin is now 3 years old. Back 3 years ago (I think you were around, I was not), there wasn't all this innovation happening. Release it today, even with no pre-mine, no IPO/ICO, weeks ahead of time preparation for people to know it will be released, and it will A. go no where and B. most likely be called a scam anyways.

There is only really 1 other coin in the same boat as Litecoin with the above mentioned, Bitcoin. This is why Litecoin is not just another alt, its the Bitcoin of alts. Smiley

***

You can also say the above is applicable to Bitcoin as well. Release it today in the most fair way and people will call it worthless and a scam.

EDIT: The above release info is what Litecoin did do just as an FYI, no premine, no IPO/ICO, etc.I love litecoin because I know who the developer is Coblee.
I also hold bitcoins but to me Litecoin is the 1st coin. two reasons, developers are known faces and very active in the community and the fact that Satoshi has a huge amount of the total bitcoins.

If Bitcoin ever becomes super successful (and reaches what some people believe 100k or 1million usd per coin), we would be talking about someone with 10^6 x 10^6 USDLet's say you want to day trade, without exposure to government money... you going to be satisfied with playing BTC/DOGE ?
If crypto is going to become an everyday item, it's unlikely there isn't going to be a choice between about 3/4 other cryptosA lot of the time I think that Litecoin is just dying a slow death. But then I look at it and it's metrics stand on it's own. A non-inflationary currency that can be transacted digitally is a huge advantage over just normal dollars. Bitcoin has a future and so does litecoin. I think both are actually products of the intelligence community and represent a new wave of future banking. The only real issue is when they do get big there is nothing to stop someone just make a new unmined copy coin that people will buy for much cheaper. Litecoin is just a secondary coin. It is not meant to replace bit coin. Heres how i think about alt coins. There like stocks all the random ass coins are penny stocks but the main ones like bit coin lite coin and doge coin are worth something :)"

 Once you have mined enough total to reach 10euros they ask you to put in credit card info to unlock you account or you can buy a 10day contract with btc to also unlock you account.

 Unlocking it will ensure you can withdraw past your 10 euro limit. But you can withdraw your money before then.

 I've bought 2 of their contracts and I made ROI in about 8 days on both of them (10 day contract) Their active mining payouts are insane, the most profitable thing you will find out there,probably like 3-4 times than a multipool but if you dont want to actively mine their contracts will net you a profit.

You can only buy the 10 day contract once per account so if you dont want to buy the bigger ones you can just make a new account.

Hope this helps, reply if you have any questions.

2014-11-23 00:54:37;I'm new to LTC, how do I start and why is it better than BTC?;"Personally, I like the [Electrum Litecoin wallet](https://electrum-ltc.org/) because it's a Lightweight wallet (no need to download multiple gigs of blockchain data), and it's a Deterministic wallet (you only need to back up the initial ""seed"" which is just 12 words - no need to refresh backups in future).

The most important difference between LTC and BTC - in my opinion - is the speed of block-mining; LTC tries to have a new block mined every 2.5 minutes, whereas Bitcoin is targeting 10 minutes. This is why LTC transactions can complete more quickly.Install Litecoin wallet app on your phone etc. https://litecoin.org/ Get some LTC from an exchange such as https://btc-e.com/ Check out the links on the right column in this subreddit and ask more questions.

For me the transaction times matter as I move coins from/to an exchange. Litecoin is quick and I can react to market swings without having to wait so long. Also when paying for virtual servers or other online services, I don't have to wait so long as they always require a certain amount of confirmations to mark the item as paid.Forget about it, LTC is dead already. that is like asking why dollars are better than the Euro, they are just different and if you have money in one you may as well have money in another[deleted]They are hardly different TBH, so let me give you a rundown on why the majority of my hodlings in LTC over BTC.

It's faster, very very fast, but in reality at a cash register in person both take to long, coinbase fixes that for BTC though. But LTC is just a breeze online, coins in and out of wherever in 15 minutes not two hours.


LTC in theory should be more evenly spread amongst users, BUT who's to say early bitcoiners didn't lose all those coins, and people arent hoarding stacks of LTC since it's cheap.

LTC has a know creator(insert debate on anon/known)

LTC is pretty damn cheap at 1/100 IMO.

LTC has better devs IMO, I hear from them more at least. 

Bitcoin has a ton of infrastructure and look at litecoins(payment processors, ease of purchase n whatnot) it's nothing, but it's at $4 and just needs to be spread, it'll take Bitcoin acceptance to help drive ltc, but at 1/100 ltc has multiple opportunities for double growth. Could die, but some could Bitcoin, Maybe 10% more likely for ltc.

They're both gambles, go big or go home.

Does LTC have sidechains yet?


it's just a little bit faster than bitcoin, and other than that is not better in any way. stick to bitcoin."

2014-11-30 15:09:04;The top 100 largest transaction make up 60% of all blockchain transaction volume.;"Litecoin is arguably one of the most traded coins in existence. The majority of those top 100 LTC addresses belong to exchanges for litecoin. Bitcoin has a lot of early adopters whose wealth is spread out between multiple addresses. The first ~million BTC mined by satoshi weren't mined to a single address, but to multiple addresses in 50 BTC increments. There is another few million that is considered either ""lost"" or from early adopters who don't plan to sell.

Dogecoin just flat out doesn't have the exchange adoption that litecoin has. Arguably, dogecoin probably has even less adoption considering half the coins in existence today were mined in just 3 months, whereas litecoin is just over 3 years old and still hasn't had half of its coin mined. 

To give a short answer your question, litecoin is traded heavily on exchanges which is why a good portion of the volume comes from those addresses. Litecoin needs to get promoted more. Litecoin hasn't been promoted as much as Bitcoin due to the media. Since less people know about Litecoin,the people that do know about it hold more of it. I believe that Litecoin will be a great altcoin.I think a large point to be made about answers you'll get is that many answers are largely speculation: ""probably less"", maybe exchanges's address, etc, but we dont definitively know. And more importantly when looking at data, does what we know match what we think we know? Especially if you're a business, you need to know, not have faith. Faith is wrong the majority of the time.

Newbies dont have a sunken cost perspective, so if you want to attract them, your arguments and presented data better be strong. What litecoin's data says I'll leave up to you to decide, its outside the scope of my comment. This is why you won't be getting my money. "

1. LTC will hit $4 in the next 48 hours
2. Difficulty will soon be going parabolic
3. BTC will start a breakout soon
4. By christmas LTC will have hit at least $6-10

I personally have noticed a big whale buying up futures contracts in such numbers while the price was low. I can see the weak ask side, so probably in the next 48 hours we'll see at least 2 maybe even 3 more breakout green candles....

This looks like a pretty good setup...hot aisle/cold aisle is the way to go, most warehouse-style places are super inefficient when it comes to cooling. The power cost details are a little confusing to me, though. It'd be better if you gave people the prices in KWH instead.
2014-12-06 13:55:08;Be careful when dealing with cloud mining, many of these contracts are a scam.;"Can we get together some information for this?

I was thinking about this before. Are there any LTCgear or GAWminer customers here (happy ones mostly no doubt if they have their ROI etc) - if so, would you mind posting the txid's of your *first* or *second* payouts or such.. so that people could take the time to see where the coins originally came from, follow the route back.

They should presumably either come from: 1) Coinbase if LTCgear/GAWminers run their own pool (GAWminers say they have ZenPool, LTCgear do not seem to specify)

2) A known pool address if they were mined on another pool.

It would be interesting anyway to see.Wait, you're saying offers of ""pay me $15 today and I'll send you $.03 a day"" could be a scam?TLDR Duhare you talking about any specifically?> OK a person (the operator in this case) can simply take your Bitcoins/Litecoins counting on the difficulty to continue going up which means that you will get far less than what you paid depending on the difficulty jump and the time frame you are invested in, add on top of that a cost for an ""imaginary electric bill and imaginary technical support fee""

That is a very solid reasoning. How can Zenpool by Gawminer can have double reward than [Multipool](https://www.multipool.us/stats.php?curr=ltc) if both are supposed to mine the most profitable Scrypt coin. Looks like they put high imaginary rewards to sell virtual miners such as PrimeHashlet  ($49)  and ZenHashlet ($15) to attract gullible buyers. **It is no-way possible for 1MHs of ASICs Scrypt to generate 2-2.5 times the reward current LTC difficulty permits.** Its very likely they are playing with Math and giving reward from the money from the sale. Also, they can abruptly downgrade their reward to keep their profit.

Also, 1MHs from LTCgear costs $3.2 and can make ROI in 46 days (http://ltcgear.com/product/asic-share-40k0-black-friday-mega-pack/) ($3.2/(0.02284215714x3.6- (0.12x1.35/300x0.77x24)=46 days) if current difficulty stays the same. But one of the Market leaders- Antminer is pre-ordering [Antminer L1](https://www.bitmaintech.com/productDetail.htm?pid=00020140830074550960Um75pnzg06E3) at $5/MHs that will make ROI in 88 days , **it rises questions about the R&D edge of LTCGear over Antminer or, KNCminer!** 

TL,DR It looks like a ponzi scheme and makes no sense out of proper calculation of mining difficulty.Yeah, I'm really not thrilled about this transition to cloud mining, it provides such a perfect opportunity for scamming. If you can't see it and don't control it, you have no assurance that it even exists and isn't a ponzi. I also dislike the centralizing effect of it, if they ARE legit.TLDR bitcoin is a scam"

I wonder how hard it would be to convince CoinStar and add Litecoin to one of these.This could help us get rid of physical money (or at least, coins) a bit faster, too. Instead of being given money that you then spend, and get change off of again, you're given a currency that remains in its digital form, unless you go through the trouble of exchanging it for government-issued money again.

Could have some benefits, but I wouldn't treat this as a goal personally, I think it's easy enough to just cash in the coins, and then buy litecoins in whichever way I preffer with said moneyUsing Litecoin at red-box would be cool as well it would be saving them money on all those micro transactions that they incurI wrote them an e-mail about crypto payouts a while back.

Adding gimmicks or flavor of the month features is usually a sign of an altcoin that can't survive on its own merits  All this would be much more interesting with LTC at 20 bucks.I think he's correct in the sense that Litecoin's core development is up to a very good standard, and there's certainly no glaring holes, bugs, lockups, or any such problems with the source itself.

However, it needs adoption outside of chikuns and day traders. It seems almost everyone I speak to is clutching their LTC tight to their chest - even small amounts like 100/200LTC is being held in the hopes that it'll suddenly become worth over $100k after a sudden BTC-Style boom.

The problem is that a lot of people assumed that with ASIC's requiring investment, and the market relying on these ASIC's being able to provide ROI, and thus the ASIC's boosting the network difficulty, the price of Litecoin/Scrypt Coins SHOULD inevitably rise. Instead, as the network control shifted towards investors and large ASIC farms, the price continued to drop.

Bitcoin's price rise came from a perfect combination of speculators, decent ASIC manufacturers (ASIC manufacturers always ran a racket where they're making the real profit, and scraps trickle down to the miners - but Zeus almost deliberately tried to ensure that miners would never make a profit from their devices), alongside large interest in spending, app development, and just pure tech enthusiasts.

If Litecoin wants to see the same sort of traction, it will need to see the type of development and enthusiasm that BTC saw. As far as its actual core development goes, there's really nothing to be done.Ahh cool, I got a shout out at the end. Although it looks like im being labeled incorrectly as ""the"" director of the LA. I'm only 1 of 4 at the moment :).

As far as the article, I can't agree with it enough. These fancy features are not going to get mainstream adoption because they are becoming overly complicated. 

Other alts out there are fighting for the same users, Litecoin along with Bitcoin and maybe 2-3 others are beyond that and are looking outside to get more people invested in crypto.

Correct me if I'm wrong , but didn't coinbase say that were not going to add litecoin because they didn't want to confuse people ? If so , why are people still hanging on to that false hope ?That's because ethereum and dark coin pose zero competition against Bitcoin seen from a network security point of view. Tony G is a monopolistic anti-competition supporter and he is scared of litecoin due to the fact it's the only coin that actually pose a competitive threat to Bitcoin. 

Don't believe me? Check litecoin hash rate and network difficulty. It's dwarfing all other coins on security. As the matter of fact litecoin's hash rate/difficulty is higher than all other shitcoins combined. 

But forget Tony. He is only one of a large crowd of anti-competitive morons who thinks competition must be killed at all cost. And they all badmouth litecoin to try kill it while cheering for premined shitcoins because they know those shitcoins will never pose a threat to their anti-competitive Bitcoin plans anyways. 

Monopoly is dangerous. Just do research. All other ""products"" and companies through history who achieved totalitarian monopoly in a marked suffered premature death and/or committed ""innovative suicide"" (unless they gained governmental special protections). Healthy competition makes sure there is a balance and makes sure premature market-deaths/suicides does not occur. 

If Bitcoin ends up as a totalitarian monopolist, I will lose faith completely in crypto currencies. Historically 100% of all tech who gained monopoly died a quick premature death in markets. I do not think Bitcoin will be any different if it gains monopoly.I just made a purchase with Litecoin yesterday, and let me say that my faith in Litecoin was reinforced, again.  Easiest online payment I've ever made.Cobele said Ltc doesnt need anything them no wonder Ltc will dieWon't be using bitpay in the future. Anyone up for creating bitpay competition? :)Yeah because unlike people who can't think for themselves (Litecoin supporters) those coins actually do something new and innovative if you look beyond the ""unminable"" and ""instamined"" aspects of them, both of which are actually improvements upon the flawed nature of Bitcoin and, by extension, Litecoin."

The âMilitaryâ Secret to Getting Rich
BY BILL BONNER / ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2014 AT 2:32 PM	

We got back from Argentina on Saturdayâ¦

The Argentines have seen it all. They know that politics, like markets, follow cycles. Good follows badâ¦followed by good again.

âWeâve had a rough time,â said one Argentine analyst we talked to.

âBecause the government has been so stupid. But people now know it has been stupid. Thereâll be a change in a year, and it will almost surely be for the better.

""The trouble with the US,âcontinued our friend, âis stocks are already priced for good things. The Fed has to manage its withdrawal from money printing flawlessly. Profits have to go higher. Inflation and interest rates have to stay at record lows.

âThe economy doesnât have to get a lot better, but it canât give us any big surprises on the downside. And none of the geopolitical or other threats â like the Ebola virus â can get much worse.

âIâd rather invest in a market that is already priced for disaster and be pleasantly surprised when it works out better than expected. Going into a market that is priced for perfection is always a mistake.â

How to get rich
Meanwhile, the Dow was up to a new record on Friday, albeit on a small gain. Gold was unchanged.

So, let us begin a short series on âHow to Get Richâ.

First, you have to learn to love being poor.

You may think Iâm joking. Iâm not. Iâm just exaggerating a little. The point is you canât be afraid of poverty. Because **if you are going to get rich, youâre going to have to take chances**.

**You may start a business, for example. Or make an investment. Typically, you make money by going âall inâ on an investment or business.**

**Itâs similar to a military campaign. When you go on the attack, you concentrate your forces â your time and your assets â on a narrow front, where you have an advantage over your opponent.**

**Making money is competitive, too. You give yourself an edge by concentrating your forces on a limited front where you might make a breakthrough.**

**Later on â to protect what you have earned â youâll take the opposite approach. Youâll disperse and diversify your assets.**

The risk in concentrating your attack on a limited front is that it may not work out. You may lose the battle.

Then, youâre in a helluva mess.

Financially, if your concentrated efforts donât work out, you could find yourself very, very poor. You may work for years on a startup, for example, only to have it go bust.

Or you may put all your money into an investment that you are sure will pay off â eventually. And then it never does!

**If that is a risk you canât stomach, youâre not likely to get rich.** 

Youâre better off sticking with the tried and true: a good job, a good career, a decent income.  Get a good education. Say the right things. Try not to stand out in any way. Be a good parent, a good citizen, a good person.

Live a good lifeâ¦and enjoy it.

Taking tour chances
**Getting rich requires a more original approach. You have to take chances. And you canât be afraid of how it might turn out.**

I was fortunate. I didnât have any money when I was young. And I found that I enjoyed poverty. In fact, when I finally came into some money later in life, I almost regretted it. Some of my biggest pleasures and greatest sources of satisfaction were lost to meâ¦as Iâll explain.

But first, letâs talk about povertyâ¦

Whatâs really so bad about it?

It is certainly true that the âbest things in life are freeâ â to a point.

There are three things in life that really matter: what you doâ¦where you do itâ¦and whom you do it with. Money is involved in these things, but not necessarily in the way you think.

When you are rich you can do a lot of things that look like fun. But from my experienceâ¦and the experience of the other rich people I knowâ¦these things are often not so much fun after all.

One friend made a fortune in automobiles. He figured out how to sell them. Then when he had perfected his business model, he took it on the road. He created mega dealerships all over the country. Then â still in his 50s â he sold out. He had a fortune.

But what to do?

âI took up big game hunting,â he told me. âI went on trips all over the world. Mongolia. Africa. South America. I went places where tourists never go. And I killed so many animals I had to buy a warehouse to store the trophies.

âBut you know what? It was all BS. Trying to fill the time. Trying to pretend that it is important whether you kill the animal or not. It was exciting and fun for a while, but I got sick of it. I wanted to get back into the auto business. Thatâs what I really liked doing. Thatâs where the real adventure is.â

Building a fortune is more fun than having one.

More to comeâ¦

Regards,

Bill Bonner Jason growing the man beard , I enjoy your videos keep it up!!"

hahaha ive got a decent amount of litecoin....im not worried at all...actually im loving this...this is what attracted me to crypto was the volatility.but looking at r/bitcoin its fucking hilarious....bitcoiners are pretty scared right now hahahaha,i actually rekon its gonna plunge down again just to really shake out those weak fools.shillers gonna shill"
2015-01-04 09:17:52;Fellow litecoiners...;"Being honest, I have been trading in and out on these moves, setting stop losses and then getting back in. I got stopped out at $2.58 and back in at $1.98 this morning. That's good stuff.

However, it's going to be really, really hard to get people interested in Litecoin or any other crypto if it continues like this. We need the bulls to return...soon. A turnaround into a bull market could help spur adoption and create a long term positive trend. After all, we have had over a year of the bears, now.Well we had a pretty bad fall , it's normal to talk about the price in times like this, Litecoin has always been used for btc/ltc arbitrage.1. No one wants to spend their $10 litecoin that's now worth $1.99.
2. No one is interested in developing litecoin because that's just ""adding gimmicks.""

So what's left? Waiting for the price to go up.the People's Republic of China is our only hopeI'm sure you're here to make money OP, we all are. However im one of those guys that will settle with my stake going to $0 because I actually believe in this. R/Litecoin is way more active than last year. I think litecoins growth is fine, were at the same price we were a year and a half ago but with a lot more coins floating around!"

2015-01-03 20:47:39;If you are bullish, why?;"Growing difficulty in mining, there is a lot more volume in movement in the Chinese market. I personally feel, the lower it goes, the higher it will rebound. From a speculative point of view, the next wave could be the highest it's peaked in history. 

Check out bitcoinwisdom.com
You'll see the charts and volume that being moved. Not to mention the Halving later in the year. It's an exciting time to be in digital currency.I'm not really bullish, but i hold some litecoin because when cryptocurrency gets adopted I think it is unlikely that everything will be on the bitcoin network and the current network effects are the best thing I have to go on to guess what the other networks might be.There is no more new demand atm. You can tell by asic companies not building or offering anything new , they are just trying to sell off what they have left . ""Home miners"" are no longer relevant in litecoin . IMO that was or is the fun of crypto currencies. When the little guy gets pushed out it no longer brings interest to the coin , all that's left are bag holders , asic farms, and the people who bought the asics hopping for the same bitcoin boom . Bullish people are just the ones who stuck around .If, as you say, you don't see infrastructure improvements in Litecoin, you haven't been following it very closely. Both GoCoin and Snapcard support it as payment processors, over 80 merchants in San Francisco now take it and the list is growing, the network has transitioned to dedicated ASIC hardware and is now basically impervious to botnets. This time last year difficulty was around 3,000 and now it's about 54,000. It's a far more secure network now. So much so that Dogecoin merged with it and all other relevant scrypt coins changed algorithms to avoid attack.

We have seen many services arise supporting it. Celery lets you buy via ACH transfer from your bank account. Pretty much every legitimate exchange trades in it. It continues to be one of the most liquid and heavily traded coins in all of crypto. It is also reliable, the developers don't take needless risks and they test rigorously. Electrum has been ported to support it, Hive wallet supports it, and 2015 will see far more.

The amount of adoption Litecoin currently enjoys far eclipses Bitcoin, this time last year...and considering its youth relative to Bitcoin, that's a big positive. It also doesn't have any of the bad press that Bitcoin endures...questions about the Bitcoin Foundation, associations with darknet markets, indictments, etc...

It's faster, cheaper, has none of the baggage and no reclusive creator hoarding 5% of the lifetime supply of the coin. So yeah...Plenty of cause to be bullish. The only thing it really needs is to be packaged and sold better.We have infrastructure. There are more than enough merchant services such as GoCoin, and there are plenty of exchanges.

We even have our own version of Localbitcoins: https://www.litecoinlocal.net

A blockchain.info clone is also in the works (http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/2r6dbf/its_finally_here_litevault_a_trustless_wallet/)

We have the Electrum Lite Client for those preferring a local light wallet, and we also have the official android wallet, and Hive-Wallet for iOS

We have a great block explorer with live transactions provided by Coinbase @ https://blockr.io

What infrastructure would you like to see?I see history repeating to some degree. I also believe in the technology that is LTC and BTC. There will always be multiple cryptocurrencies and there is absolutely no reason why LTC can't be one of those. 

It is hard for me to panic because I went through this same thing with BTC. People said this or that, and look where it went. 

Bull Horns ON!Because people are either bagholding or buying on the way down. They hope to at least break even thinking it'll pump because it can't go down forever. 

People don't realized LTC, PPC, NMC were the first shitcoins to get pumped. They still think they must pump because they pumped once.

Just noobs getting their first taste of trading. LTC just need adoption. Need more exchange. Litecoin will take few year to get adopted. In Korea not many people know LTC. Maybe soon we change that. only reason to be bullish at all is that you might believe in 10 years Litecoin is still around. Then it will probably be worth more than $2 at that point in time. 50% of all coin is made after halving this is good step for litecoin !

bitcoin made same step 2$ =>32$=> 2$ just before the first halving

But if you really wish to use the core client, then I shall teach you how to add a node manually so you can get block right from that.NoYeah only use exchanges to hold the coin you plan to actively trade. Anything else, you need to control.Meh, best practice is to always keep the coins in your control. I keep the bulk of mine in cold storage, but I also keep a decent amount of LTC on btc-e and sleep well. I wouldn't be worried in the slightest that you have them on btc-e. Just be patient and withdrawal to your address once it has updated. we need ledger wallet hard wallet this proof again where is dev litecoin ?[deleted]it is a bad habit to use exchanges as a wallet but they are safe enough while you wait. I personally have several thousand coins on the exchange."
2015-01-11 22:27:34;Hash rate is starting to dip;"This all has to do with the coin not being profitable to mine in most areas as the price is less than 2 dollars a coin.  GPUs still and won't be able to mine effectively ever again on LTC unless the difficulty drops about 40K which I don't see happening.There is a lot of earlier generation hardware out there that doesn't produce enough now to justify running it at these prices. I expect that is hardware that is being shut off at the moment. It's definitely good for people who bought and received the Titans and other 100mh+ hardware.It's expected, nothing to see here.

Most people who don't mine Bitcoin mine on pulls that mine that most profitable coin. With new pump n dump alts coming out everyday and Litecoin at a low price those pools have moved to other coins. 

They'll come back to litecoin though once that coin dumps.and the halving comming in 7 month 
nowSlight dip, nothing to see here. same thing said of bitcoin before the hash rate exploded.... just variance More for hoarders :)If the hash rate is starting to dip, then how will you knuckle heads get a steady supply of THC into your brains to believe that litecoin is going to succeed?Good for us long-term. Litecoin's original appeal was that hobbists can mine it at home with GPUs - a drop in hash rate is a return to our non-ASIC roots."
2015-01-11 20:46:13;I am new and was wondering if there were any wallets that can hold more than one type of crypto currency?;"I've not used it but you might want to look at http://coinomi.com/I heard of one in development months ago, never heard anything else. I know hive wallet supports LTC and BTC but I wouldn't recommend it as you can not see your private keys.CoinCorner has a pretty decent mobile app that handles BTC, LTC & DOGE. You're storing your coins on a centralised server though with that.

Hive is another one for BTC and LTC, not sure about the security credentials of that one as I've never used it.

As for other altcoins, don't expect them to appear in multi-wallets any time soon.. it's BTC & LTC all the way, DOGE is only still alive because it has a huge cultish following.theres been quite a few attempts at this but i don't know of one that really succeeded.  if you dont have a bunch of crypto to hold on to just getting the big three btc ltc doge android wallets is pretty easy.HiveWallet can but it's pin verification process is sloooooooooooow."

2015-01-25 22:34:48;so... regarding coinbase tomorrow's announcement in case you're curious;"First U.S. Bitcoin Exchange Set to Open Coinbase Has Backing From the NYSE, Banks and Venture Capitalists
By GREG BENSINGER
Jan. 25, 2015 4:34 p.m. ET
The virtual currency bitcoin is getting a very real boost on Monday, with the opening of the first licensed U.S. exchange.

Coinbase Inc., a startup backed by $106 million from the New York Stock Exchange, banks and venture-capital firms, said its exchange will offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency.

The exchange could bring needed legitimacy to the currency, which isnât backed by a central government and is traded over virtual exchanges, primarily overseas. Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money wonât disappear.

Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buffeted by the collapse of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox last yearâtaking with it around half a billion dollars of investorsâ moneyâand a security breach earlier this month at Slovenia-based exchange Bitstamp. The value of a bitcoin itself, determined by trading on existing exchanges, has fallen to about $240, from a peak in late 2013 of more than $1,200.

âTo have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,â said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies. âBitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this.â

Coinbaseâs founders say they have been working for five months to win licenses from state financial regulators. They have regulatory approval in half of U.S. states, including large population centers like New York and California. For now, Coinbase can do business with account holders only in states where it has approval.
Coinbase will take a small percentageâlikely less than 1%âof most transactions, said Fred Ehrsam, 26 years old, a co-founder. The exchange will initially be limited to users in the U.S., but Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, 32, said he plans to expand overseas.

Mr. Armstrong said he expected to attract both individuals and businesses looking to trade bitcoin. âOur goal is to become the worldâs largest exchange,â he said.
Others are looking to open U.S.-based bitcoin exchanges, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their early feuds with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg .

Financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been scrutinizing bitcoin recently. Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, is working on a so-called BitLicense for firms looking to offer digital-currency services in the state; Coinbase is operating under earlier regulations. Mr. Lawskyâs plan is seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions, and it may give outsiders more confidence in the currency.
Bitcoins are created using high-powered computers that âmineâ for the currency by solving complex mathematical equations. They are exchanged digitally either for currency, or goods and services. Ownership and transactions are recorded, anonymously, in a so-called blockchain, which backers say reduces the risk of fraud.

Bitcoin grew to prominence in recent years in part because of the ease with which it can be transferred.

Coindesk, which tracks the price of bitcoins, says 82,000 businesses accept the currency, double that of a year earlier, including e-commerce site Overstock.com Inc. and Expedia Inc., as well as many small retailers. The value of all bitcoin is $3.2 billion, according to Coindeskâs price index.

The NYSE invested in Coinbase during a $75 million round of fundraising that closed this month. Other investors include USAA Bank, the venture arm of Spainâs Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Tom Glocer. Venture backers include Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.

The NYSEâs investment was intended in part to âkeep an eye on bitcoin as it matures as a legitimate currency,â President Tom Farley said. âAny currency relies on its acceptance.â The Coinbase exchange âis an important step for the currency to become socially acceptable.â

Coinbase counts about 2.2 million consumer wallets and nearly 40,000 merchants that use its services. The company has about 75 employees and plans to operate in 30 countries by year-end, up from 19 today.paywall argh , anyone have the full txt?If Coinbase are launching as an exchange, isn't it likely that they could also involve other currency pairs? ? whats your point, already announced on r/bitcoin.

if you want win money only.Litecoin : Benefits least from the pumps,  suffers the most from the dumps. This isn't just compared with bitcoin, but nearly all notable altcoins below it.New people in the crypto currency world always think bad news/good news is what drives the BTC and LTC price. 

In reality news does nothing to the price. It is the actions of the whales and bots that control the market. Do you think the whales and bots care about Btcer.com getting hacked for a measly 7,170 BTC? No. Do they think they can get others that don't know better to care? Yes. They sell a little, cause you to panic, you dump coins, they buy theirs and YOURS back at a lower price. The currencies in the industry are generally connected for those who are selling on swings or don't have the confidence/means/lack of common sense/common sense to hold long-term. More narrowly, none of the coins, including litecoin and bitcoin, have much of an individualizing image, save btc's stance as largest and first. 

Most of the trends going on are on par with a group of insecure guys assuming that everyone likes the same kind of ass they do. When one person mentions that they like that skinny ass in just the right way, a mad scramble ensues of trying to not be the last to yell ""I like that skinny ass too!"" Moreover, in times that solid stances are presented, they have to be presented in order to incite a skinny ass scramble. Further, Nostrodomus-like predictions come afloat like in all markets. 

I think the best any currency (that regardless of how they're being treated, are unique in coming up in a situation like a product) can do is to continue their protocol development to maintain integrity at the core. Eventually, something will spark with the right group of people and something will give various contenders (currencies) an added spark that allows consumers/traders to develop trust. Its all relative really mate, you gotta look at the big picture, if LTC was as big as BTC(and this goes for any other crypto currency), there would probably be just as many 'hacking' incidents.   Its probably actually a good thing that LTC is connected to the value of BTC.  The recent drop comes after a huge rally though, so it was to be expected and may not have anything to do with the recent hack at all.  > We have *too* much connection to BTC value! 

FTFY.It's still basically a clone coin that relatively few merchants accept. Most people don't see the need and view LTC fans as early miners on a dying coin looking for a chump bagholder.

So, if you really want it to separate, get more large merchants to accept it and get more reputable exchanges to do direct fiat-LTC pair trading. "

2015-03-08 10:10:20;Alpha Technology may be facing Possible Fraud Investigation;"good for them.  My heart goes out to the author of this article and to all the scrypt miners who got screwed.   Its terrible the way we are treated and I really feel like we as miners should organize somehow and agree to boycott all pre orders.  The system is too ripe for abuse.  Of course now with crypto price as low as it is we may see all asic technology stall.

 I followed alpha tech closely and was even in #litecoin on irc when they first showed up claiming they were going to produce the first scrypt asics.  At that time they seemed legit, or at the very least dedicated and reachable.  When pre orders opened up the only thing that stopped me from ordering was because of personal finances i was trying to get myself out of debt by liquidating most of my ltc to pay for it.  

I'm amazed that my nightmarish experience with MAT actually makes me one of the lucky ones who got the product i paid for even tho they were 5 months late and only works half as promised. As they should be.He writes that this:

âAs we will not be spending more time on non-essential components, and as a result also require less final manufacturing and testing time, we will still be shipping in July; even with the increased hash ratesâ

Reassured him.

It did quite the opposite the opposite with me. It sounds exactly like a made up excuse when you are failing utterly and have no way to explain it.

Every single thing they said actually sounded so fake. A little tip: If you want to sound real then say little, the more words you use to explain something, the more like a lie it sounds.Glad I did a charge back in July for my 2x 250mhs unitsThey're a joke. They continue to insist that nobody is entitled to a full refund and that they are somehow entitled to keep everyone's final payments, in spite of the fact that they have missed the shipping window they set pre-order expectations on by half a year, now. Their originally-stated shipping window was Q2/3 of 2014. We're about to head into Q2 of 2015 now and they've shipped nothing. Demoed nothing. Yet they still seem to believe they're entitled to keep peoples' money.

These guys are criminals and even IF they somehow manage to survive the year or ship a product, NOBODY should ever do business with them in the future. They are completely unscrupulous.I knew this place was a scam when I saw the photo of their offices.Its somewhat interesting that failed projects seem to be ""automatically"" accused of fraud. Do people not understand what it means to place orders for products that are in development? 20-28nm is bleeding edge tech that has inherently high failure rates. "

2015-03-15 21:00:35;Litecoin Price Technical Analysis for 15/3/2015 â Pending Release;Took a small dip. Still in triangle. http://i.imgur.com/A8Ps8dA.png
2015-03-15 14:10:25;Did ASICs Hurt Litecoin?;"ASICS absolutely harmed Litecoin in a big way last year and really held it back. Not the ASIC machines themselves but the fact that a huge chunk of the early devices ended up in the hands of a small group of people who dumped massive amounts of litecoin right through the later half of 2014.

To compound this fuck-up. Half of the Scrypt ASIC manufacturers turned out to be scammers and most of the rest delivered late or decided to keep the miners for themselves (KnCMiners for example)

I don't think that most people recognize security when it comes from a milk crate.

I don't think we need to screw over everybody who bought ASICs by changing Å algorithm.  

I don't think ASICs are responsible for the low price, granted they are adding to the downward pressure.

I agree with nattylitecoin in that now it is easier for average Joe to mine litecoin by buying an ASIC.

Free money doesn't make sense.  Mining is a business, and that, to me, makes sense.I think the price fell because of a combination of things...
Asic's have not really been helping the price, Since large miners have been continuously dumping large amounts of LTC for BTC. I believe ltc prices would be higher without asic's right now.  
However you have to look at the bigger picture. If bitcoins success continues like it has at this rate, Litecoin will follow and we might see btc 8000$ and LTC 250$ next bubble>I highly doubt industrial Chinese mining farms was Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network.

You're actually incorrect. 

[Satoshi absolutely foresaw industrial mining farms being the primary nodes on the network, long term](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306): 

>The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  **Those few nodes will be big server farms.**  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

He also predicted the advent of ASICs and a lot of other things that many people these days don't believe he foresaw. 

Bitcoin is progressing *exactly* according to Satoshi's plan. So far, at least.ASICs as an end-game are inevitable for any coin unless the coin continually changes algorithms.  It is simple logic that a chip designed specifically for a given purpose is better than one designed for generic compute.  The only exception is if an algorithm is specifically designed for GPU hardware.  Even then, differences between architectures (Nvidia vs AMD) can result in significant differences in performance.

Ultimately, ASIC is not a bad thing in theory.  It is the most power efficient way of securing the block chain.  What has caused a problem is that the ASIC manufacturers are able to extract money from people via bullshit ""preorders"" while using the hardware to mine while the hardware was the most profitable.  They double dipped, and this problem was created as much by people trying to buy an ASIC as it was by the manufacturers.  I refused to preorder an ASIC on principle, downside being you reduce your own chance of ROI but anyway.  Digital currency mining is the 21st century's Wild West.
I dont think ASIC hurt Litecoin. It sure isn't the reason why the price fell. Yes, it sure did. Just look at the prices. No one wants a crypto currency controlled by hardware manufacturers and mining warehouses. These big operations mine the majority of the coin and then dump it for fiat.

Part of the allure is that anyone can mine it on conventional hardware. Once you have specialized companies manufacturing and controlling the hardware environment, it's over. Everyone who was mining becomes ostracized and loses their interest, taking the public cheerleading support momentum with them.Either way the same amount of LTC was mined. When I started mining I started with LTC. When the ASICs started coming out I switched to a GPU friendly script to stay away from anything ASIC. An ASIC farm will always have more power and control than a GPU farm. 

If you're going for adoption and a wider mining base why not use something most people have.Litecoin is hurting cause of high inflation not asics.The halving in 163 days will help. 

You need to realize litecoin is one of the only good coins with solid fundamentals (hardcap of 84 million ) and released in a fair way (no premine or ipo distributed to 70 people).I think the entire Mt. Gox, Silk Road and other debacles did more to hurt all the digital currencies than everything else combined.  And I think there was a huge bubble, when bitcoin started to go crazy, every gambler in the world wanted to buy in, and the alt market was guaranteed to pick up some spillover, which it did, until the rampage ended.

Now we need to be asking seriously what the honest business case for digital currencies is.  Is it just a huge ponzi scheme?  Is the prime value actually based on having a market where people can gamble?  Or are these currencies actually earning their pay by providing a solid service to the wider public.  My impression is that so far they are 95% gambling racket and pipe dreams, and 5% real service.  If you want to be a crypto currency wheeler and dealer, maybe do some mining if you're in a cold place with cheap power, you can make some money if you're lucky, but your'e mostly playing against other players.  Meanwhile, almost nobody buys shit with crypto in real life.

How important ASICs are in all that is not much.  In principle, it makes sense to cut the power consumption as much as possible, but this kind of crypto implies an arms race because it's founded on the difficulty of work, and when you have a war you will often have some of the most brutal players come out on top by any means necessary, it wouldn't matter whether that took ASICs or dead babies.  Whether that kind of arms race is good for stability in the bigger picture is hard to say, and I think we'll actually have to wait and see, because the success so far was not based on providing a stable service, it was largely a gambling game with all kinds of false and unsustainable economies.I think it's a testament to capital investment into LTC. If nothing else, putting Scrypt on a chip proved to be a very difficult challenge. Companies tried, companies failed. I don't know the specifics, but it's my understanding the Titan rendered the Scrypt-N algorithm (Vertcoin - ""truly ASIC proof"") completely obsolete. In like 6 hours.

I just bought two USB miners (ASICS) for $32 for my babies-to-be. They'll be rockin' 440Kh/s at about 2 Watts. While it may take 3 years to ROI on those bad boys, it still provides a presence, no matter how small to the network.

Just because your not making USD's hand over fist doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't contribute. Nothing other than you're own perception of ROI is keeping you from firing up 4 280X rig at 5MH/S (maybe greater now with the current kernels). If anything ASICs make it easier and more efficient for the average Joe to bolster LTC.

Think of it as a generator for when your power goes out, if (or when) our economy does, know that you'll have a back-up. They have definately hurt the miners bc of shitty pre order scams. I think ltcs price is just a reflection of crypto prices dropping overall tho, not so much of bc of asics.I think even better than GPU is POS instead of POW, but POW are the cheapest coin and BTC with ASICS most expensive... so... WTF :DThis doesn't make sense. Bitcoin fell last year too, but if you look at their rise, that was after their asics came along. You've not been able to mine Bitcoin without them for years now.No question it hurt it. It made lightcoin mostly pointless.

You could not mine as a hobby or to support the network, if you bought an expensive ASIC you wanted to make your money back, so all the ASIC miners immediately sold for fiat currency.

And it meant that people could not shift to other coins if there was oversupply - the ASIC could do lightcoin and nothing else (all the other scrypt coins could not absorb the volume and mostly vanished).

It completely destroyed lightcoin, and I bet the developers are kicking themself for deciding not to change the algorithm when they had the chance.

Back then people said things like: It shows that there is real support for the coin, that people are willing invest in custom devices, and various other things none of which were true.Asics did not hurt litecoin, it strengthens tremendously what's most important in a p2p network; the level of security.

Asics hurt the cpu miners tho. But that's how natural evolution works. Old tech out. New tech in. Is how the world rolls. If it did not work like this, we would all still be stuck with MS-DOS v1.0. 

Asics = the coin is actually being taken serious among the professional money/investors. 

Those who thinks LTC is dead will be butthurt. Majorly butthurt. And me and my bag'o'litecoins will patiently wait until I can laugh my ass off seeing my coins skyrocket in value later while all the litecoin haters who said it was dead, go cry in the corner. 

But first we need to let Bitcoin have its 15 minutes of fame. It will drag LTC with it. Patience fellow litecoiners, patience. Could take some time. Months years who knows. All I know is, my patience is keeping me cool while I wait. i think its fine as long as you cant convert bitcoin miners to scrypt miners. it would be such a nightmare

it has been pointed out that asics did hurt litecoin, not by design buy just from the politics of how the asics were distributed"

Can I suggest few things ? The ability to change the currency for the current price would be nice. And a bit of colors when hovering in the wallet section would be pleasant. Also,  background images and vdo takes some time to load... lastly, under ""global decentralized currency..... "" adding a bit of sales pitch on the main advantages and strengths of LTC to catch the attention (network strength, confirmation time,  fairness... ) ? Good Job !!!!!Cool site! For some reason when I click on Shapeshift.io link it asks me to download a file.I think the video is kinda dope , is it ntended to be accompanied by sound? My tablets not picking it up; I believe the right tension of tone would make it great. Also, after glancing through it (so I may have overlooked it) there are no links to what the blockchain actually is, how coins are created (mining), nor how to interpret the ledger. This may be a good add on medium for people visualize transaction confirmations and  what value is being stored and protected on the network.

What is the strategy for keeping the content fresh? Will all crypto news / blogs and , various ltc chart analysis Be posted regularly and will serve as news stand  / tutorial  or will it turn to an autonomous creature that seemlessly trades through various exchages and transparent integration of Ltc services (true portal) or will it serve as merely a map to get interested parties The information they need to do these things?

2015-03-21 00:00:05;The Mycelium Entropy is Anti Litecoin;"Let me clarify this a bit:

First, rassah ist a great guy who is not afraid to state his own opinions. Sometimes, not everyone agrees with this - buttcoiners managed to ban him for some time from reddit. But his brutal honesty makes him authentic, even if you don't like a particular view.

His opinions largely intersect with the rest of the team. In this specific case the rest of the mycelium team has a different opinion, otherwise we would not have included litecoin support explicitly in this hardware product.

Second, Rassah is not a dev. he is our community manager, and a very good one. He travels to many conferences, talks to media and does support for users in many channels. he has no control over sources, signing of firmware or even most parts of the homepage. So even if he would be an awful person he would not have the means to manipulate the process against litecoin.

Third, we welcome any scrutiny of sources and binaries. We would love if somebody would head over to https://github.com/mycelium-com/entropy take a look at the sources, build it themselves and compare the binary. I personally did verify that the binary that was signed by mycelium that has the sha1 hash of 1d203522b5437309c1f0c15749844d3692e17e1c  corresponded to my own build environment based on https://github.com/mycelium-com/entropy/commit/136e39285b1a3d77c40d6a492ba62cf28f8aeaf7 - You can build+sign+flash these yourself - and for maximum security you should do so as well. The mentioned binary can now be found at https://mycelium.com/entropy and on every shipped entropy stick.

Personally, i think it is exciting that we have come so far security wise, That we can bypass so many intermediaries and go directly hardware->printer with FULL software auditability. (btw we are preparing to also publish the hardware schematics, but we are still looking for a proper export format)To be fair, it was a Bitcoin device that only added Litecoin because their Kickstarter raised another 10k (thanks to Litecoiners) to do it. I doubt they'd do anything malicious to Litecoiners using the device, it'd call into question their ethics across the board and destroy their Bitcoin business, too.

That said, Rassah is wrong, just like all the other ""one world order"" types.FYI, I'm not the owner, or the lead developer. And are you guys really that upset about me saying that Litecoin doesn't offer anything new over bitcoin, and thinking that slightly faster confirmation times and more volume are good enough? Really? Grow a pair, guys. I admit, I have not been following Litecoin for a while, so if there is something that is really different that was added by developers since the initial thing, or if it has some unique benefits, just tell me what they are so I will learn. Don't get upset over it."

So yes there would have to be agreement.

A decenthralled exchange could provide the same goal of quick transactions. IMO this is the only thing major crypto is lacking. Millisecond confirmed transaction speed.

I heard people talking about Litecoin and thought Id check out what the fuss was. I ended up buying about $80 worth in early 2013 and then forgot about it for awhile. When LTC first hit $2 or so I remembered what I had bought. Ive bought some things over time but bought more coins to replace what I spent. I like the speed of the Litecoin over Bitcoin and have no plans to sell out.

I only wish I had bought more than $80 worth back then.... a nice $1000 buy would have been awesome! :) For me it was a technology curiosity. Long story short I got into mining when I started with crypto's and used my crappy graphics card to try to mine BTC. After a night of mining and some dust later I realized it wasnt going to work (my first introduction and understanding of the difficulty and asics). 

Did a little more research, found Litecoin, mined it for a day, and never looked back ;).It was the constant selling that got me into LTC. Knowing all I had to do was short LTC and I ended up richer. Don't have to worry about LTC going up. Was intrested in selling computer power online, and Bitcoin came up. Eventually Bitcoin started to get more FPGAs and ASICs, which then turned me to LTC.The November 2013 bubble sparked my interest."

2015-04-18 05:18:28;Litecoin Association Director Andrew Vegetabile Makes Public Statement On GAW, Includes Personal Message To Josh Garza;"If litecoin dies, it will die without being a scam. So be it.

This day, Litecoin moves forward with a clear mission for all people and employs a concise crypo-currency concept based on proof provided by TH's of computing power, not the material success of the few.

 

Questions?/u/TheRealMage way to go!   

I have been out of the scene for a while, but good too see some good people are leading the rocket UP!

good luck my friend, support!Quote

âAs the one who has started the initial public statement months ago on the initial potential issues with GAW and Paycoin, I felt it was necessary to be the one who can attempt to close this chapter in crypto eco-system. For those unaware, GAW bought an exchange and I felt it was irresponsible to have an exchange along with a crypto coin because it presented an ethical boundary that should not have been crossed where one could have the potential of owning a coin and having the means to dump it.

 

Within the last few months since my statement, I have learned many things about GAW. Investigations by the SEC (substantiated) along with potential investigations by FinCen, the IRS, the DHS, and others. I want to reiterate one of my statements made months ago, which stated that I foresaw something like this akin to leading up to a massive failure beyond cryptos, which now bleed into standard news sites and once again giving cryptos a black eye. The level of at the best mismanagement and at its worse potential scamming and illegal activities has reached beyond which I can once again sit back and stay idle.

 

The amount of promises have been daunting at best. A $20 pay floor (at the time of this writing is a magnitude less at ~$.20), the always profitable miners, acceptance with major retailers such as Walmart and Target, Paybase, and a slew of other items. Development beyond initial release was practically nonexistent for the core wallet, forcing customers to utilize online means to store coins which were susceptible to hacks and withdraw freezes.

 

What GAW and Josh Garza have done above amounts to potential mismanagement. But this is not the end of transgressions. For anyone following the Bitcointalk thread which is over 1600 pages now, within the last few days more details of potentially illegal actions have been exposed. These include securities fraud, money laundering, extortion, grand theft, insider trading, retaliation against whistleblowers, wire fraud, charity fraud, and Iâm sure there is more I missed. This is not trolling or FUD at all, and I caution anyone calling this as such. These are serious illegal activities and should not be taken lightly.

 

I know that writing this exposes me to trolls from both sides of the isle, but at this point this is well beyond me. The fallout from all of this will be damaging to the entire crypto eco system and set back efforts from thousands of collective volunteers across all the communities that work tirelessly to promote cryptos in order to gain mass adoption. What Mr Garza has done was give a metaphorical middle finger to everyone in cryptos and has earned him a place alongside Mark Karpeles and Ryan Kennedy in my eyes.

 

What can be done to put an end to all of this? The answer is that the Paycoin community needs to put their foot down and take their coin back. I understand that the Paycoin foundation has been attempting to bring more transparency to their actions and I applaud them for their recent efforts. On the other hand at this point in time I am unaware of who had knowledge of what was going on at what point in time, so I am respectfully careful with them. Regardless, there has to be a developer within the Paycoin community that is able to make the necessary changes required in order to move past this soiled event in our history. If this is the Paycoin foundation to do this, and they do it correctly, so be it.

 

In order for the communities to heal from this entire debacle, the code must be forked. In my personal opinion, all prime controllers need to be removed and the coins contained within them need to be sent to a burning address. In addition, any serious bug fixes must be resolved in order for community members who own Paycoin can have a reliable offline means of storage instead of relying on an exchange to store coins (at the time of this writing I believe a wallet update was done, but I am unsure if the major bugs were fixed). Also, the community could be more involved in the direction of the coin. Demand 100% transparency from the leaders in your community, and ensure that they have substance to back up the claims they make, regardless of the leader who may be providing information.

 

There are more suggestions to be added here, but these items are the major one that needs to be resolved (and the most difficult). In order for the community to continue being a Paycoin community, they need to remove GAW from the picture.

 

I also wanted to add in my intentions here. What people fail to understand is that while the circumstances under which Paycoin was created along with GAW are trash, the community isnât. They are already a part of the crypto eco-system whether people like it or not. In order for all of us who really wish to see cryptos grow, we should be helping those in these types of situations. That is my intentions behind this.

 

Lastly, I would like to end with this, a personal message to Josh Garza. On my short time here on earth I have met many people with sociopathic traits, and you fit the bill. I really have nothing else to say beyond this, and the way you have used people like toilet paper is deplorable. And just as a FYI Iâm still up for the live debate you decided to run away from.""maybe i'm reading it wrong but did the mage basically say the only way to fix paycoin was to destroy it?  not a bad idea, not sure how feasible it would be, but still.That makes sense.  Still pretty funny either way, especially the backpedaling on the debate.  I should be visiting bmore soon we rlly need to do lunch or beers or both. We could have a halving party where I mourn my juicy payouts but celebrate the growth of the coin."

This echos my sentiments exactly. Even is $othercoin succeeds and BTC/LTC dies, at least crypto is alive and well, for it is the idea behind Crypto that is revolutionary, not any specific coin.Yes! Just say no to these flavor of the month gimmicky features. He is exactly right that they are almost always attempts to pump price for dying coins. At this point, if one of these gimmicky features were to be added to litecoin, it would just put the idea in peoples head that litecoin is a shit altcoin. 

Funny how quickly we forget just how many altcoins have been created with litecoin as the back bone. interesting threadI totally agree!wow props to coblee for honesty and vision.I must be a fool.Dear LTC, you can see what BTC problems are today and you can act pre-emptively. Why wait for that same s** to hit the same fan?  I agree, screw ""snake oil"" features but you already know what are the features BTC is missing or what has become problematic. 

BTC has problems with number of transactions. What are you waiting for? 

BTC mining has slipped away form ""the crowd"" to few big ""central banks"". 
Can't you see that BTC is on it's way back to exactly what it attempted to run away from - central control by few big corporations. This is so painfully obvious, I am not sure how any of yo can miss it and why LTC is waiting for the same to happen.

I am not sure why LTC wants, so desperately, stay in the shadow of BTC and repeat every BTC mistake on it's own. 

LTC has a huge advantage - it can learn from the big lumbering idiot - BTC :)
I disagree. It's not snake oil if it works .I still TOTALLY disagree with Charlie, that ""Bitcoin must succeed first, or all crypto fails."" Totally and completely. That's like pre-iPod Apple saying, ""Well, the MPMan wasn't a huge hit and it had major problems, I guess we should give up on portable MP3 players, they can't succeed."" I also disagree that simply by virtue of being the guy who created the original incarnation of Litecoin, he has the best ideas for how to make it succeed long-term. I think his approach is and always has been, ""Ride Bitcoin's coattails."" I don't think that's a winning formula.

But I DO agree with him that Litecoin does NOT need to add needless ""bells and whistles"" for the sake of achieving short-term price pumps (which is really the only reason anyone wants them, in the first place).If you want to see how much ground litecoin is losing just look at the darkcoin announcement posted in January 2014 (now being renamed to DASH).  That thread is 5000 pages long since January 2014.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.99880

Also the creator of Darkcoin, Evan Duffield actually invented the X11 algorithm whereas /u/coblee just liked the look of scrypt already on another coin (tenebrix I think but not sure) and implemented it into Litecoin.  Nothing inspirational or magical there so can we cut the bullshit worshipping please?

2015-05-10 15:53:21;Is block size an imminent issue for Litecoin, too?;"Litecoin has 7*4 transactions per second (tps) - that's four times what Bitcoin currently has. Our Core developers have also put in better anti-spam rules, which should work better than Bitcoin's.

Eventually, if we do reach 50% of our max tps, than we may seriously have to consider changing some of these rules. But just because Bitcoin is currently changing their block size, doesn't mean that we should. Just changing blocksize can have bad effects on the blockchain.

Look here on what Warren (of Litecoin Core) has to say: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/issues/194

Guys, did you forget about testnet? I can redirect my 8 GPUs at testnet if devs need testing their work on block size, just drop me a line.

2015-05-10 04:29:36;Why does this 50 ltc transaction say it's from coinbase? Is a coin base btc address buying ltc?;"A special kind of transaction, called a coinbase transaction, has no inputs. It is created by miners, and there is one coinbase transaction per block. Because each block comes with a reward of newly created Bitcoins (e.g. 50 BTC for the first 210,000 blocks), the first transaction of a block is, with few exceptions, the transaction that grants those coins to their recipient (the miner).Source:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentationIgnore the fact that there is a company called ""Coinbase"". They might as well be called ""Moo Moo Bum Farts, LLC"" for all the relevance they have to that link.

When any block-mining-based* crypto currency generates new coins, this is done with a special transaction called a ""coinbase"" transaction. It is where coins come from - no block-mining-based crypto has any coins to pass around until they are created by Coinbase transactions.

Bitcoins are created by Coinbase transactions in mined Bitcoin blocks on their blockchain. Litecoins are created by Coinbase transactions in mined Litecoin blocks on the Litecoin chain. There is no interaction.

Moo Moo Bum Farts, LLC, have absolutely nothing to do with either. Neither does ""the company called coinbase"".

(* ""block-mining-based"" is really ""BTC-based"", but OP seems to be obsessing on completely incorrect things and making stuff up in their head, so I picked an alternative term)I know how, but why did you stumble upon this observation?

2015-05-24 20:08:50;What would you do if litecoin hit and was trading solid at $50.00 usd ?;"id have $75!! woohoo new car(1) Would not sell, unless I was in a dire family situation.

(2) I would look at my wife and tell her: ""Most of the time I'm not right, but look at this!""

(3) I'd contribute a bunch more time to the LTC community.

Sell all. Then buy coke and rent hookers. I've already held much too long to sell at $50. The utility it would grant me would need to be substantial enough to affect my quality of life before I were to sell. 

What I would hope, is that when it becomes feasible to sell my litecoin, it matches the timeline where it is also feasible to use it as a form of payment when the infrastructure and branded reality of the coin has grown up, thus negating the need to sell to get the same utility. 

Beyond that, it also depends largely on how this community grows in relation to the coin's growth. Currently, the people ""making decisions"" on things that are very important, like marketing and branding, have more developed skillsets in development and are largely doing other efforts without isolated branding thought processes. After working on branding the coin for 6 months and being largely ignored/shut down, the work that is going on now **in that area** doesn't impress me. I think it was a huge loss of productivity. Now presently, this small group of people is peanuts in relation to the coin's price. The current number of people who know about ltc is absolutely nothing compared to a real ""blow up"". 

If this current side of the community who is doing things becomes the official representation of ltc in a world where representation affects public use and where we are in the real-deal public light, I may consider selling because I don't trust those people to develop the image of the product that ltc is in this arising situation where we are advertising new currencies, currency possibilities and the paradigm of currency itself. I would look closely at how marketing efforts progress because image is very important. What i'm thinking, is that those considerations will not hit home because those ""in charge"" will not be swayed, and if ltc does get into it's **own** limelight as a thing separate from bitcoin, then it will be because a major backer, corporation or entity empathizes with its cause and/or profit potential. Then, I will be looking to what I think about that new entity and sell if I don't like the direction they take. I'll hold if I think they develop an ecosystem where litecoin will be a primary player in the image and development of digital currencies, a branded highway with its own off-shoot roads, instead of a few columns holding up a different road that future technologies utilize.   keep holding till its at 500I would take out 20% and buy gold and take out 30% cash to last me until the Bitcoin/Litecoin infrastructure is complete and every major retailer accepts crypto currency's so I could spend the other 50% with out having to convert litecoin to cash, and hopefully by then my holdings have gone up even more due to the fact that people are not converting to cash because now every major retailer accepts crypto currency. I've held when it was actually 50 and am still holdingI have 400 ltc atm and it if it ever went to 50 dollars I'd use it to pay for uni. That'd be insane amounts as I'm only 14. I would be waiting for a higher price.  If LTC hit $50 and traded solid for a while at that price it would make a massive cup and handle trading pattern.  That would mean it would hit $100 in some time after breaking over $50.I personally only have 7.2 LTC. I'd probably sell 4 and buy something cool.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A939QRRSNV4I'd sell. Unlike last time...I'd sell and break evenI'm holding it until I can spend it for most of the things I want to buy. If it ever reaches mainstream adoption and I can use it everywhere, it should reach a value where I never have to spend anything else. I'm not involved in crypto with the intentions of converting it back to fiat, if I can help it. I want it to replace fiat currency completely.If it hits? I think you mean *when* it hits I would cash out and spend like crazy.

The woman selling homeless papers at the local grocery store? Here, have 20 dollars.
A night out with the guys? Drinks on me.
Oh, I found this cool Doctor Who prop online that I absolutely do NOT need! Let's buy it!

I hate my brain.I would probably hodl.Work/drugs/adventure/investment Throw a massive party.At this point..I'd likely sell. My miners are so far from breaking even and I could really use that money right now. Though, I could continue mining and keep being active in the LTC community.I might diversify a bit more if we get up in that range again, but it really depends on the market. If things are looking good I will probably continue to hold a large portion of LTC. I would gift it all away to my 2 favourite crypto enthusiasts;

Alice (in Wonderland) and Bob (in the basement).Say fuck you to the world and go buy myself a private island off the coast of the carribean.a. Brag that I have $100 for doing basically nothing

b. Make paper wallets for my IRL friends

c. Buy other coins with the high valueThe same thing im doing now, working with the LA and educating the general population on Litecoin and cryptos. I'd buy more to get out of usd.I have LTC because I do not want fiat money.  When Litecoin hits $50 I will be happy.  I will continue holding all my Litecoins (fundamentals did not change due to price change), except for what I would spend to treat myself.I would sell it all . One of the reasons why the price isn't going anywhere is that everyone is holding .Under assumption of stability (= reasonable volatility of +- 10%), and market acceptance, or expectation of it (e.g. a major player like Coinbase accepting Litecoin) I'd prefer LTC over BTC, and fiat, of course.I'd have $150. Holding would still be my best option since that'd barely put a dent in one month's bills. I'd need at least one more zero before the decimal to sell.I'd laugh. Why would a pretty much copy of BTC be the coin to be in. There's gotta be another coin. [deleted]"

Also, am I missing something or what, why sign up for gocelery at all unless you're using it to buy Litecoin straight?I just called the phone number listed on gocelery.com's website +1 (646) 461-6799 and the voicemail of some individual person in New York, NY picked up the call. I could not make out the person's name, but nothing about the number seemed to indicate a business line. I left a message and will continue to pursue contact with gocelery.Update: Nearly 2.5 days have passed and, according to an email I just received, my bitcoin purcase has been funded. I am on my mobile, so I cannot now check the status of my account directly. I will write more later.Okay, so here's my update....

The email notice I received was accurate. My account was verified and my Bitcoin purchase was funded. Yaaay! I was able to move Bitcoin out of my account to purchase Litecoin on BTC-E.

On Tuesday, I received from GoCelery the following message:

We enabled bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin purchases via credit cards last month and were pleasantly surprised by the demand! Unfortunately, we have decided to revert this feature to private beta today and are working hard to bring it back later this month. Please bear with our growing pains! Please email us back with subject line 'Credit Card Beta' if you would like to participate in our private beta.

While I responded with a request to be included in the credit card beta process, I remain unable to purchase crypto-currency with a credit card. Today, I logged into my GoCelery account to purchase Litecoin directly and I found that credit card purchases have, in fact, been disabled.

I'm left wondering why GoCelery has taken a step backwards...If you don't mind higher prices, coin.mx is legit. You can buy LTC/BTC on the credit card.I tried to use GoCelery but wasn't able to. 

I still stick by my tried and true method of purchasing LTC. $ -> BTC -> LTC. I can turn $1000 into LTC in less than 15 minutes.

2015-05-30 10:09:56;OKCoin Faking LTC Volume;"And you think they don't fake BTC volume?
OKcoin volume is fake and its been fake for years. 

OKCoin is not keeping price up. Everyone has known their volume is fake and it has always been BTC-e and Bitfinex that people used as a metric for LTC price.

I've been saying from 2013 that OKCoin and Huobi need to die as they are going to a cause for major problems in the future (now). What's the matter?  Getting nervous about the impending hardfork clusterfuck on the immediate horizon for the bitcoin community?   That's going to be so much fun to watch.I'm pretty sure that everyone has already assumed that volume on OKcoin was faked for a long time now.

So since you came here to blatant troll the Litecoin community for whatever reason (for the life of me I do not know, since Bitcoin enjoys many benefits from having Litecoin around) let me ask you this.

How's all that real volume on empty gox working for you ;).

Please continue to post these informative threads, you are such an upstanding citizen of the crypto communities.
If anyone needs proof of how long OKCoin has been manipulating volume, you can read this thread from Dec 2013. The creator of the charts has been divided by 3 because OKCoin's volume couldn't be correctly calculated. https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=11868.0with zero fees it can be easy to fake the volume i can  put 100K btc or ltc sell order and i buy it back in the same second and it will cost me nothing . first when you talk about okcoin, you talk about 2 different exchanges, one with fees (international) and one without fees (china) the later much higher volume is not included in cmc
second bitcoin is also traded there so volume is just as much affected
third my trades are not fakeyou are assuming that they keep the price up, when actually they could be keeping it down. yesterday they sold fake ltc to get margin calls from longs.they made over 10k real ltc in 10 minutes. they might even need LTC cause they don't have enough, why the withdrawal daily limit is only 2000, while on btc is 500? makes no sense.Every coin has a certain percentage of faked volume.I think is not coin fault if exchanges do that mentioned in the post.So any trolling in regards of that is just stupid.I wouldn't dismiss this guy as a troll. He is simply passing along information to us. Albeit in a kinda nasty way. I think it's very important that we be mindful of what happened with MTGox and use that information to protect us and our investments. Maybe some people don't know about OKCoin's troubles yet or need to be reminded.LOL, no shit sherlock :)"

That is nice, didn't need to do this but he did.   What's the point of this? For $105 you get a $40 RPi and $15-20 worth of accessories (preloaded with FOSS). There are cheaper alternative ways to setup a full node if that's the only goal or I'd expect that someone interested in cryptocurrencies would be capable of setting up their own raspberry pi.

Also, under ""risks and challenges"":

> The first is writing some bash scripts and using cron or something to monitor bitcoin core and memory usage to ensure bitcoin core starts up again smoothly if it crashes for any reason, and to gracefully shut it down and restart it before it ends up in a state where it could crash.

 >The third is to write some simple scripts to handle shutdown and other tasks.

Really? Those are the big risks and challenges for this project?? Aside from the absurdity of ""scripts to handle shutdown"" (I've got a shutdown script for you: /bin/pkill) these are things which would take anyone familiar with init, cron, and bash (or python) less than a couple hours to complete (and I think that's being pretty generous).So if I donate $105, which I'm considering, what happens? Would this be of benefit even if I do not operate a raspi? Sorry for being dense.Looks like you found a way to make money with bitcoin and litecon.

That being said it is nice to have some fresh crypto showing up in your wallet every so often.  
some good ways to get crypto aside from mining or buying from a place like circle.com or cryptsy.com  is to sell things for crypto. check out the different markets here on reddit and on litecointalk.org.  I have had the most success buying unique silver bullion from coin shops locally then selling for a tiny markup on the forums.

2015-06-21 06:33:39;Hey guys, investment noob here, can I ask you a few questions?;"I started buying litecoin just a few months ago when the price was $1.70. And then the price dropped to 1.35 :/ But then things turned around and I've been buying more and more the past few weeks as it's going up. 

I think now is a good time. The past couple months have shown that litecoin has legs and with the halving coming up our chances are very good we'll see a big comeback for litecoin.I would invest in Litecoin because in August there is the Halving/Halvening. That means the daily Litecoin supply from the miners will be halfed. I think the price of Litecoin will rise up to six dollars. You can also see growing daily Litecoin Transactions. Normally 5 to 6000 and now 16 to 17000 per day. I also invest in Litecoin at the moment.Buying bitcoins or litecoins or any coins is not what i would call an investment.

Its a currency bet! Either you hit the jackpot, or you lose!

(im myself owner of couple LTC\BTC and would love to see it explode in the mainstream, taking power from the big banks and corp elite club.)

I believe myself that cryptocurrency on an individual p2p level will grow massive in the years to come, and that ltc has a good place together with bitcoins. It all comes down to computer power working in harmony with the demand of safe storage and transfer of value. If 99% of miners shut down, the coin would be dead from an investment point in 2 minutes. And of course that wont happen unless brute government involvement, so i can only see growth and possibilities in the longterm.Well technically you should have bought 10 days ago when the price was around $1.70 .  The reward halvening is coming in 7 weeks so that should help the price along.I wouldn't recommend buying ltc as investment right now. In Cryptos it's better to day trade due to the price swings. Btc day trading is interesting and a bit more stable for example[deleted]Around this time might be a good idea yes. I would personally wait till it is a bit cheaper though, around 2.5. 

No. LTC is in bubble."

2015-07-05 14:43:54;Should I close my LiteCoin shorts? I am feeling exposed. It may go up.;"Ok. Closed my shorts. No more draft. Boarding the Rocket.If what we've seen in the last month is a couple of pump and dumps, then short away as the price is bound to fall.

However, shouldn't it have fallen by now if it was just artficially pumped? We're seeing a sustained price. The volume is still there, hences there's a lot of interest in owning LTC.

The chartist dude over at NewsBTC reckoned we'd see a big sell off this weekend too, but that hasn't materialised and he's now predicting further gains - http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/07/05/litecoin-price-weekly-analysis-poised-for-gains/.

Personally I think we're just at the start of a big correction.shorting litecoin with a halving in 50 days , epic fail.A trader I am not, but I wouldn't be shorting litecoin for the next 3 months. It may be quite lucrative around thanksgiving / xmas time a la 2013. But now, I think you should take the other side. People were heralding resistance at $1.8, $2.0, and $3.0...and LTC refuses to trade below $4 now. Just a gut feel, but I would be on the buy side (if I bought) until about $7. Up to you. But you're likely to lose money if you still keep shorting :)It depends why you're shorting. Do you believe Litecoin is a viable technology and is just overpriced right now? Or do you think Litecoin will one day fizzle and die? 

If you believe the former then it's a bad time to short--there are just too many variables right now and you can't possibly know if Litecoin will drop next week to $2 or bounce to $6. If you believe the latter then, assuming you have a lot of cash flow to cover short term losses, you with come out on top eventually. "

Download the repo from https://github.com/litecoin-project/liteaddress.org and open liteaddress.org.html with a safe web browser (preferably incognito mode).

Bitaddress.org generates random characters (entropy) from the position of your mouse cursor and on how it moves. These random characters are probably use to create your private key (sort of like a password for your wallet).

Everyone here is in it for the money to varying degrees and until a certain amount of development outside of the technical side is shown, that degree will probably be more skewed in balance to the monetary favor. It's a very, very good backbone with some ridiculously able muscle that desperately needs to think about how it's future will form without a tough skin and well-placed fig leaf.

People aren't conscious of their nervous system and heart in the way that an attending neurologist or cardiologist would be and don't directly base their social and cultural ties to worship of the stomach and heart. The body has an image and a mind that reaches out further, networks and learns communication methods to reach more people more intimately. It's the same with our community: all we have to focus on is price and the technical development of the coin's infrastructure, so naturally, that's what hopes and dreams rest on. 

To put it in a smaller scale image, we're a slap chop without the ""you're gonna love my nuts"", or Oxy-Clean without ""**HI I'M BILLY MAYS**"". 

When development further grows to include how this can tie into the world realistically, and how ltc is perceived as a brand and image apart from it's inner-workings, **then** we can expect people to dream and chance the coin into another place in their lives. Only once people in this little sub community can dare development apart from price and tech. development can we ever reasonably expect the public to understand what the hell any of this is and therefore give us the peace of mind that relies heavily on us holding a practical technology that the public is aware of what the hell it is.

2015-08-02 23:22:59;Shapeshift question;"ShapeShift's fees are high. but when you need a quick exchange it's always there.Hey - we see this question a lot - so its worth explaining a little bit here:

The reason there is almost always a gap between the BTC -> LTC rate and the LTC -> BTC rate is the spread given by the exchange orderbooks. The way you need to think about it, if you look at a normal BTC/LTC market on BTC-E for example, the Buy and sell orderbooks go in opposite directions (this is the spread). ShapeShift has to take the spread into account in our rates and thus the difference you will see in buy/sell rates.

Stated simply, the rate going from BTC to LTC is never the same as the rate going from LTC to BTC. This is true of all currency conversion, and the difference grows in proportion to the lack of depth in a market (BTC/LTC is more liquid than something like DASH/POT, so the latter would have a bigger spread). As these markets mature, this problem will slowly diminish. 

Hopefully that makes sense, happy to explain it more if anyone has any specific questions regarding this :)

""Current exchange rate is ...""

Nope. There's more than one exchange. They have different rates.

Extremely convenient ones generate revenue by charging a margin on the exchange rate.

You are free to use an inconvenient exchange if price matters more to you.As far as I know the fee's have always been this high. You are paying for convenience. "

I think it's better of me to share the report in its current state, than to keep this information hidden from everyone while I complete the report.

I hope you all find this to be as interesting as I do! Let me know if you have feedback or questions.

Don't gamble what you can't afford to loose. Halving doesn't mean price increase (although it might happen). Price might drop so the increase might not be what you expect. Also, you should know when to sell... Sounds like your panic buying , don't do that. Just because the 2nd most popular coin with daily volumes in millions and on every Chinese exchange is going to have it's first halving in 16 days, doesn't mean the price will go up :P

take your time and find the right exchange for you , in meantime play with this +/u/litetip 0.5 LTCBuy bitcoins with your CC through something easy like Coinbase then use the bitcoin to buy litecoin on an exchange.Vault Of Satoshi would have been my recommend but sadly they closed. Last I checked ltc were still about 5 bucks. The highest I've ever seen them get is about 35 bucks. 
As I haven't been doing anything since VOS closed I hope someone else can help. Back then credit cards with reputable exchanges were not an option. Cex.ioYou can buy LTC  for Sheckles at https://www.bit2c.co.il.  they accept bank transfers from all Israeli banks.

luke-jr argues for the sake of argument, and even when he wins said arguments, he doesn't do any work to make what he discussed happen

overall it would be unhealthy for the litecoin community and developers to work with such a cynic.

you could even fairly argue that it is people such as luke-jr which necessitated these events with bitcoinxt in the first place.where you buy ?It's nice, but what is your reasoning?

2015-08-23 12:18:35;Litecoin might dip before/near the halving;"that's OK it took BTC 5 months to actually moon after it had its first halving
I know halvings are rare and 'exciting' characteristics of cryptocurrency, but people really need to keep some perspective...The time and date (within a small margin of error) for this occurring have been known since LTC launched and it is very naive to think that it will have any real change on value...

I say this because all of the large traders/holders/miners have known about this for a very long time and therefore it is already factored into current valuations...This means that virtually ANY movement on price will be manipulation/speculation rather than a true change in value...

I am not saying this to be negative or spoil the mood, but rather to warn people (especially those newer people with less trading experience) that this is a time to be very careful when it comes to purchasing/trading, because almost all of the movement in price will be artificial and orchestrated specifically to take your money...There's a 50% chance the author is right...""might""?  Of course it might and most likely it will.  It will be total ""sell the news"" effect and I bet it drops to 2.75 or lower.   And it will bounce from there...so good shorting opportunity now and good buying opportunity after the the dip.I still haven't heard a sound logical argument why the halving will lead to a price surge. I posted this weeks ago and got some rude comments and lots of down votes.

In essence, hundreds of thousands of Litecoins are bought and sold each day. A few thousand less Litecoins being sold due to less mining pressure is a drop in the ocean compared to that.

The only reason it may go up is if a load of hype pushes the price up and to be honest I think that's already happened and been priced in after the last price surge. I think the most likely outcome is the whales start dumping once it's clear there's no halving pump.&#3232;_&#3232;Test. Plus I liked the graph.

2015-09-05 23:06:56;[repost for visibility] So the question is, what are people REALLY looking for in the future of Litecoin?;"well my simple answer from a simple investor (2500 litecoins)

personally everyone is different in life and will have different reasons why they invest or what suite there needs ext. My reason was having the choice of choosing a crypto currency. Bitcoin is about having another option than the banking system which is kind of a monopoly, for the first time ever people now have the freedom to choose. Now only having the option to buy into 1 crypto currency would also be a monopoly and would be kind of boring, so instead of buying into mainstream bitcoin in the crypto world, I chose the alternative. I believe that bitcoin will succeed greatly and people who have the mentality of wanting to explore there options which brought them to bitcoin in the first place will look to diversify and thus litecoin or maybe another alt. will flourish. 

For the record I don't expect to be a millionaire or am using it to get rich and pull out into cash, I am here for the journey the experience, to say to people I was there in the beginning I never sold out. You have to be a visionary to understand the power of the blockchain, its going to have a impact and will change society like the internet did and one day people will say how did we live with out bitcoin before, and moneymarts will be the next blockbusters, and there will be frictionless innovation that will create instant millionaires with new ideas and products that most people cant even fathom. so please don't sell people your cheap coins and remember you havnt lost anything until you have sold.>DON'T UPVOTE.

don't tell me what to do upvoted :D


>Are most people here just because they want to be overnight millionaires? 

yup , if bitcoin was still a few cents , not many people would care about it. Cryptocurrencies need to have a hard cap and solve the endless printing by the fed.Thus the value of my coins needs to go up as fiat inflation rises.


>The problem is that without very many options on where you can spend Litecoin, this price gain will not last.

Actually merchants just convert to fiat driving the price down.


>Why should someone spend $10 on a LTC when they can buy $10 in BTC and have more places to spend that money? 

Have you used btc lately ? confirmations are way to slow and the whole blockchain hard fork fiasco doesn't make me feel safe about leaving my hard earned money in btc.


>Instead of making memes about the moon why don't you learn how to program and contribute to LTC or write your own exchange or iOS wallet?

Chikun and egg problem , when the price goes down no one cares , what litecoin needs is to hit a all time high and stay there.This will cause an explosion in users.


>Do you really want big bubbles where you might make some good money quickly but 100 people got screwed so you could do it?  

yes , but I want the price to stay there , bubbles are good exposure. 


>yes to that question then I hope you make a metric shit ton of money because it won't take very many bubbles before less and less people want anything to do with LTC which will dry up the liquidity 

not worried about Litecoin's liquidity and It comes from Chinese whales and traders , not people on reddit buying $100 worth of litecoin.

Proof, value, wealth, and transparency. I think I answered your question.i just want to use it already. fast transactions, you copy paste some adress or click a link filling it in for you and send ;) some money. Like in mmos, but you own your wallet sorta. It's easy and fast if adopted. Litecoin is lite after all.I want to resubmit my answer. I want it to serve as a proven technology that keeps a precise and accurate record of any transaction. I want it to be a successful example of how the concept of currency can be created (or cloned) and value in terms of dollars is artificially fabribracted. Once realized, I hope that it contributes to an awakening that we've (the global we) been slumbering in; a world that executes in a manner inconsistent with the principle of sustainability and move to a resource based method of valuation. Upon this understanding we can build a true blue print for use of the natural gifts amongst us and fundamentally know what wealth this miracle of earth can provide to each and all of us.

Otherwise, I agree with Ocmoho, if you have $3K to burn, just but the coin. My recommendation to everyone in this community is to buy 1000 LTC, put it in cold storage, and forget about it.

Also, I've been mining LTC and hedging with ETHER 50/50. I'm not sure what the GPU mining specs are for ETHER at the moment, but as I understand the difficulty is going up dramatically. So if you stay the GPU route, start NOW on ETHER. "
2015-09-13 15:27:55;Litecoin subscriber count down going on 1400 users. lets reason this out.;"Its just old bots being removed by its owner, for whatever reason he/she may have. Now this ""negative"" metric is being used by chills/trolls as a way to try manipulate the price down by attempting to make this sub look like its losing its followers. These bot-accounts were added in 2013 or so for the opposite reasons (manipulation of price up, short term). Then they went to sleep all until now. 

It's irrelevant if these bots are in this sub or not because they bring nothing positive to the table long-term anyways. The only purpose of these bot-accounts is to use it as manipulation short term gains. Long term this will have zero impact on litecoin's future. Litecoin is so much bigger than just a small reddit sub. How many subscribers this reddit contains are completely irrelevant to litecoin price movements. 

I have no idea who owns these bot-accounts. I only monitor and compare crypto-metrics. Sorry guys, I'm still here. And I'm uncertain that I'm even a subscriber. When I suspected that some one had attempted to hack my account before the halving, r/litecoin was removed from my pull down. So I don't know if I was unsubscribed or was never a subscriber in the first place.I would suggest this is psychological manipulation,

This reddit chaos came at a time where the Litecoin hashing rate plunged 300 gh/s (and back) in a day 

https://bitcoinwisdom.com/litecoin/difficultyI'm looking at the stats, but they dont seem to have a daily subscriber metric. If someone can find this Id like to look into something.The reasoning is fairly simple.

In order for some things to go up, others must  go down.

It was going up, but now its time for it to go down.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDpPlrHgquMThere are about 23 users on this sub at any given time. Let that sink inProbably unrelated, but I figured it might be worth mentioning. I just subscribed to this subreddit and I wasn't able to find the ""subscribe"" button until I used RES to turn off this subreddit's CSS. It's sleek and pretty and all, but the ""subscribe"" button isn't labeled with the word ""subscribe"" unless you mouse over it. Not very intuitive!It help if you do actually have a subscribe button because I cant see any and the subscribe banner at the bottom is non clickable. I use IE 11 (yes, I know). /u/TheRealMageMy guess is that the notable absence of a run-up in the price as a result of the halving left many people disappointed and disillusioned. They went looking for another get-rich-quick fantasy to sink money into.

Instead we get the usual circle jerk topics on the front page and the excitement over the shortcoming of other cryptocurrencies. It's pathetic really and in fact, typing this out has made me realize that I could care less having this sub on my account. Even though I also hold almost a quarter of all my crypto investments in Litecoin, because I do believe in it, the community on reddit is just purely toxic in my opinion. Maybe I'll join back when this community grows up a bit and has actual intellectual conversations that inspire rather than put down. Maybe. But I really do doubt it. Peace.yes. weak hands leaving the market. goodbye.probably because litecoin has not made any significant progress. No companies have offered to support / sell / produce anything that has to do with litecoin. It's not going anywhere. It's disappointing.well won't they be sad in a few months Not a huge surprise. Lot of people came in pre-halving, drank the Kool-Aid about big gains due to the halving, and when it didn't happen...they left. Now, the sub is back to the traffic levels of about six months ago.[removed]

2015-10-11 19:53:02;Litecoin + Smartphone = Global Adoption;"Great ideas! App development(ios,android and even regular web apps) + payment processors to accept litecoin and maybe dogecoin. Specifically im thinking about companies such as Coinbase,Gemini,Xapo etc, i know that GoCoin offers both litecoin and dogecoin as a payment but it isnt as popular as the three companies i mentioned above(yet)...

Also Encourage people to see how efficient Litecoin is by mentioning Bitcoin(which a lot of people are familiar with) and also mention how much faster litecoin is when it comes to transactions compared to bitcoin etc etc..  

Btw when you estimate Litecoin will test its ATH(Bitcoin Halvening,Gemini ETF,FEDs auctioning coins...)? And Do you think that litecoin will reach a ATH higher than the $50 reached during  Late 2013? This is why I've said, and will say it again, that branding and image is crucial to this industry and especially for Litecoin with it's current stance holding so much potential. 

How does one get people to try something out that is in a realm so distant from their usual life? By making it attractive. By making it something that people desire. Litecoin is ""rare"" because it has barely touched the general public. 

It's not as easy to do a quick 3 step process of litecoin + smartphone = global adoption. There are several steps in between that phase. It's like an amazon of 15 years ago stuck at the idea of ""amazon + sell everything imaginable on e-marketplace = global adoption"". 

For Litecoin, there's tons of acquisition, localization and image work to be done still. Furthermore, mobile tech. is already widespread, and spamming users and promotions won't touch the same high note that I think your imagining as it would if Litecoin embraced mobile tech. and mobile tech. was just being accepted by the world. 

If you want that 'on the train' vision, then pair ltc with future stomping grounds of communication and marketing. Look at AR technologies potential linked with mobile and consider supporting lead AR ad developers so litecoin is emotionally and visually linked to the day when plain concrete walls become breathing worlds and adverts for anyone wearing wearable tech, like evolved google glass. 

It's discouraging that these concepts of marketing are skipped over  and discussion about consistent, world-changing profit, growth and adoption is still discussed. You can't spam, pump and dump stock push a product and expect earnest adoption. That sort of promotion can create trends, but it's not the long-haul work to create sustainability and protection from being bought out and used for a very powerful group or super-corporation's intent. This is true for where I came from as well. Everybody has cheap, powerful enough smartphones to run a light wallet. I believe the two major barriers to mass adoption of crypto currencies are exchanges and portable wallet apps:

Ideally, exchanges should have low to no fees that make it interesting for the user, and maybe provide other services at cost to keep them running. And portable apps should be easy to use, or even more than that, pleasuring to use (as in not necessarily ""fun"" to use, but just not being a hassle).

I am currently working in a wallet for iOS that will have iterations for BTC, LTC, VTC and maybe DOGE (for now), and I am putting a lot of effort into making it easy to use, and having an nice UI. And that's important, because when a user sees a nice UI, they think ""wow, I want to use that and see how it works"". Hopefully it will be out this year, but I can't make promises as I work full-time and this is only a side project.The areas where this descentralize tech coud be adopted faster and better are the states with kind o special status like autonomy in there political system.example Pais Vasco,Catalonia,the places where the internet infrastructure are allready advance and whole thing is allready put in place,the only thing what they need is a website in there language where they coud aquire,buy,sell this product.Why?Because they have many things that are done(traded) localy.In areas where people like to have freedom and liberty in this countrys we coud make a real revolution or better said evolution for a better future.Yes we shoud focus also in poor countrys from Africa but first we shoud aply the technology where is already posible thats all my point here.We need also wallets and apps for every kind of phone,pc or tablet.But spreading of the word shoud be done in there native languages.Read the classic dystopia novels and you realize that none of the authors ever dreamed that people are willing to pay for and carry around devices that record and report every move they make. Say hello to your ""smart""phone - THE wet dream of every spy agency and evil hacker scum. 

My point is, that ""smart""phone is the last thing I want to have access to my finances.Paycoin + smart phone = global adoption

Monero + smart phone = global adoption

Dogecoin + smart phone = global adoption

Litecoin + bag holders = lulz"

2015-10-11 18:28:57;Litecoin Value Perspective;"Why would Whatsapp worth 19B be crazy? (it's actually worth a lot more now). Whatsapp has 1B active users, Bitcoin has 2-3M at best.What is even crazier is the current bitcoin valuation.  Considering the year long 24 carat cluster fuck that is bitcoin it is staggering that the price is where it is right now.

Even today a PSA has been posted over at /r/bitcoin stating that transaction relay fees have been drastically increased by default in bitcoin core in order to combat the spam transaction issue crippling the network

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3oecqm/psa_to_address_mempool_flooding_bitcoin_core/

$249 each for that??   I wouldn't pay $90

It is an absolute insult that the whole world is talking about bitcoin when it is so fucked up right now.  You only have to look slightly under the surface to see serious issues

No, it would not be crazy to think that. heya i'm for the first time here. i found this board and i to find it truly useful With China doing all the mining and trading volume I doubt any pump will be sustained unless China has a reason to keep price high. BTC better buy. crypto's market cap is just a drop in ocean for a worldwide economy. nothing new here, everyone should just realise it.What's your timeframe for the crypto market to gain mainstream traction, now that Gemini has the green light in NY and others are coming soon...?It's all relative. I personally would not be surprised if Bitcoin did have a 100 Billion market cap someday, but also think that it's entirely possible for it not to happen either. To put the 100 Billion market cap in perspective, right now Apple (AAPL) has the largest market cap in the world with 625B. AMD has a smaller market cap than bitcoin, yet there is a higher chance that someone has AMD in their computer versus a bitcoin. 

While I personally think litecoin will reach 10B someday (roughly $120 per coin) I don't get caught up in comparing market caps. "

2015-10-17 23:40:14;Litecoin Trademark Problems;"Hi!

My name is Patrick Kothbauer.
I'm part of the Swedish Chamber of Digital Currency Commerce.
I've been in Twitter-contact with losh11 regarding this matter.
Here's an update.

0. The period of opposition is ending in about two weeks, 20th Nov.

1. The trademark application covers, among many things, 'Information Technology' and 'Magnetizers' (hard drives etc)

2. The original application included class 36. In class 36 we find 'Banking and monetary services'. Class 36 was later removed from the application - I'm not sure why.
We have a copy of the original application on the chambers cloud drive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byw3ijV504P-ZUlkT0k5dVJzWGM/view?usp=sharing

3. A letter from the applicant to OHIM discuss class 36 - but it's written in German so I don't know the content - it does mention the word 'Hacker Szene'.
You can find the letter on the chambers cloud drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byw3ijV504P-aG13R0pKaE5LX28/view?usp=sharing

4. We've been in contact with an attorney at the Swedish patent office and we are also seeking guidance by the community on how to best formulate an opposition.

5. An Indigogo-page was quickly created to raise the â¬350 (ca $380) to pay for the opposition (Minimum goal on Indigogo is $500 so that's what we're raising). There's $10 raised so far - yay! :)

6. One opposition has already been filed, but our impression is that its argument is quite weak - I think that the opponent has a chain of home decoration stores called:Coincasa, http://www.coincasa.it/.

7. Yes, Litecoin is released under MIT license but it's not clear to us if that will prevent OHIM from granting this word trademark - unless we make a fuss about it.

Below are some suggestions of what may be included in an opposing argument. Our hope is that people from the digital currency community will collaborate to create an opposition which is well grounded. Here are some ideas:

0. To gather enough data which clearly show that there is a large and growing community around Litecoin - spread out around the world - including the European Union.

1. To claim that the Litecoin software and it's name are closely tied
together. Since Litecoin was released under MIT license as free software for the public - a word trademark by an individual (who is neither Litecoin's inventor or publisher) goes against the ethos under which Litecoin was made public.
2. Based on (1) and (2) to claim that the trademark applied for, lack the necessary distinctive character under category 9 (which includes Information Technology) - to clearly separate it from Litecoin - the digital currency and its community.

---
So, that's a starting point - any feedback, suggestions or corrections are more than welcome.

Most important is to get the ball rolling.

Cheers
Patrick
patrick.kothbauer@scdcc.seLitecoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See COPYING for more information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

10 litecoins = $30. If you can't afford to lose it, don't do it. If you can afford it and aren't going to trade, you don't want to leave your stash on the exchange anyway. Set up all the wallets you can and practice moving coins around to get the hang of it.
Here's the Litecoin Association's guide on how to purchase Litecoins it should explain everything:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgo68YboNJg

If you want to learn more i highly recommend checking out the other videos on the channel they cover a variety of topics.
Are you in the USA? Gocelery.com is probably the easiest option. Litecoin is solid.I use circle to convert my usd to btc (its a legit US exchange) From there, you can transfer It to btc-e and convert to ltc, or short it, or whatever you are planning. 

Note that you should store it in a local wallet (dont leave it on an exchange for long periods, as you never know when if a website may get compromised)bittylicious.com is great.  You can go straight from GBP to LTC."

Thanks for all the work losh , mage and co you do.Hello!

Just an update for anyone following this opposition.

As I wrote two months ago in this thread, OHIM requested that
we make some adjustments to the application of opposition.
Most notably we needed to find and appoint a legal representative,
someone with a legal practice setup in the EU.

We've managed to make all the adjustments to the opposition that OHIM requested and everything was submitted to them in time.

I guess someone will update this page as soon as we hear something
from OHIM. Again, thanks for supporting this and let's hope we win this!

You guys rock.Any updates r/losh11? Hi!

Just an update:

1. The funds raised from the Indiegogo page is being transfered over to the Litecoin Association. We raised a total of $225, which after Indiegogo and bank fees translates to $180. So $180 worth of Litecoin or Bitcoin will be transfered to the LA this week.

2. The opposition has been registered with OHIM - the EU organization responsible for handling trademark regstrations. On request by OHIM, we are currently making minor adjustments to the application due to the complexity of Open Source and trademarks. These adjustments have to be submitted to OHIM before mid february 2016.

Any questions are more than welcome!

He is a representative from the Swedish Chamber of Digital Currency Commerce, and is one of a number of folks working behind the scenes in order to help us during this ordeal and greatly appreciate his help with this.It looks like the target has been easily hit by BTC and LTC donations as of right now.

Current LTC: 132.6 = ~400 EUR

Current BTC: 0.249 = ~80 EUR

Meaning: In BTC and LTC alone (btc-e prices), the fund has around 480 EUR

I hope this opposition works out. I was just about to donate, although I see you're well above your target now so I don't know where my money would go.[deleted]how is it going? did you stop the guy from trademarking it?I just donated a bit, but i'd be willing to donate more if we're short.

2015-11-08 17:02:17;Why the altcoin takeover scenario has become a possibility!;"This is a really good read, and something I suspected of happening for quite some time. 

It's almost ironic in a sense, where Litecoin could be utilized more as a payment method than Bitcoin (even if the end result is still Bitcoin in someones hand). The transfer of wealth and utilizing Litecoin to transfer it is the exactly the ethos of cryptos. Not wealth storage that has become apparent with Bitcoin.Yes, thank goodness that the Litecoin devs have stated that they are ready to raise blocksize as necessary and that they condemn the behaviour of Blockstream and other small-blockists ;-)I used to be a bitcoin purist. I hold some litecoins now only because of the block size limit issue. I would hold more if there was no cap or an aggressively increasing cap.I havn't taken the time to read it properly yet, but yes the 1 mb cache will prove to be a major obstacle. (one i don't believe it will fall down on) , however the politics around increasing the cache or the tx is all very sticky for the btcersnoice bro!

Am i naive in thinking because people aren't taking to Bitcoinxt (currently @ 7.2% of nodes http://xtnodes.com/), that bip 101 would never be implemented due to the democratic style of authority in the decentralised world of Bitcoin? 

This January 11th deadline seems so pretentious to me as if the masses have already decided against (a fork?), then scenario #2 seems to already be the answer to this debate. How challenging is it to increase the block size for litecoin? Dogecoin can't be the ""world reserve currency"" as it is inflationary. There's just no way. "

2015-11-21 15:33:39;Btc-e Bitcoin/Litecoin/Fiat Arbitrager bot. Uses Bellman-Ford algorithm to find profitable cycles of trades.;"So...it's not finished yet?Have you actually found cycles that are profitable after fees? My guess is that they don't exist. If such a cycle did exist within BTC-e, BTC-e itself would execute it. And they could do it without fees, unlike the users.

I used to use a cycle between BTC-e and CampBX. BTC-e bitcoins were regularly cheaper than CampBX bitcoins so I'd buy BTC at BTC-e and sell at CampBX. After the trade, use dwolla to move the USD from CampBX to BTC-e, via my checking account, and move the BTC directly from BTC-e to CampBX.

The fees took most of the profit but I still had some 3%, I think. This was around 2 years ago. Since then BTC-e is very difficult to put money into so the scheme doesn't work anymore. Unlike the scheme from OP, it involves multiple websites so it's not as easy for the website to get a jump on you.

To do it right and maximize profit, you need all your money moving simultaneously. The loop takes up to ten days including the bank transfers and the maximum that you can loop around is the dictated by the bottleneck in the process. For me, it was dwolla's transfer limit. I don't recall, maybe it was 2k per day?

The ""power stroke"" in the cycle is the buying and selling of BTC so I'd watch the relative prices of those two using a script that I made. It was hard to know when best to make the trade because the arbitrage rate was moving around all the time. I wouldn't want to leave to money just sitting there, not earning, but I wouldn't want to buy/sell and then the next day the trade difference moved in a good direction for me and I was still waiting for the money to move around the loop.

You always want to buy and sell simultaneously so you need to hold BTC and USD at the same time. If, while waiting for good conditions, one of those tanks, it could be wipe out all your income and more. That's a risk. Another risk is that one of dwolla, BTCe, CampBX, your bank steals all your money, like MtGox did. This will also wipe you out.

In the end, you don't make much money this way and you take on too much risk. Good luck!"

2015-11-29 20:41:18;Raspberry pi mining for fun.;"Raspberry Pi's are often used as the controller devices for ASIC farms and large ASIC setups.

As the Pi is based on RISC/ARM architecture, there will be miners available, as there has been mining software built under that architecture previously - Android/iOS miners spring to mind immediately. I believe there is a cgminer install available for raspberrian.

However, note that it's a fantastic way to burn out your Pi; and I'd be surprised if one Pi Zero would ever even return so much as one cent in LTC. Its only real purpose as an educational tool would be in how fast you can kill a device.

I'm not sure what kind of educational experience you're looking for - if it's in cluster computing, sellotaping a few Pi's together doesn't really count. They don't exactly speak to eachother or anything - at best, a controller Pi could send them commands, but the pool you're connecting to is doing all the real ""cluster computing"" work. 

If that's what you're looking to get a base grounding in, just buy three or four Pi's, and start by building a basic priority message queue service across them. Once you're comfortable with this, you can start looking at basic cluster operations, such as array sorting across multiple nodes.better use for you raspberry could be,supporting the LTC network with a Litecoin Node. http://raspnode.com/diyLitecoin.html Each RasPI is only good for CPU mining about 0.75 KH/s in my opinion.

Why destroy the usefulness of zero-conf today?

I believe that Charlie was completely against this, saw something on /r/BitcoinXT about this. Not sure about Warren, but I am against RBF.You don't need rbf if you have blocks that can accommodate all the transactions happening, hows about litecoin just keeps its block size policy sane and keeps up with demand?It should!RBF is inevitable because:

1. It is up to the miners to decide which transactions goes into a block, and
2. RBF is beneficial to them, and
3. There is no way to stop a miner from doing RBF.

2015-12-13 21:35:18;Let's implement a solution on Litecoin now;"""My initial suggestion would simply be to take BIP101 and divide it by four: an immediate increase to 2MB and then everything else at 1/4 BIP101 thereafter. Since litecoin has already been running with 1MB blocks for a long time, increasing the size of blocks from 1MB to 2MB in that first step is unlikely to create danger, and it shows that the network is forward-thinking and will be ready for increasing demand. An alternative is to take BIP101 and divide it by eight, which does not immediately increase blocksizes but is still a vote of confidence in the future of the network. I realize that Charles Lee may be hestitant, but BIP 101 is already active on the bitcoin testnet, is extremely simple, and provides certainty for the future. However, we'll listen to anyone who puts anything else out there.""

I vote yes. It is a simple change that shows Litecoin is forward thinking and ready for the future. We are agile, we are established, and we are ready to provide real currency services for REAL people. I'm for this. 

I've been holding bitcoin and litecoin for a couple of years, though most of my investment has been bitcoin.  I'm getting very frustrated about the deadlock re bitcoin blocksize debate, the politics of Core devs having a potential conflict of interest re Blockstream / LN, and bitcoin miners still backing Core despite Gavin and Mike giving them an alternative with BitcoinXt.  

Bitcoin miners seem to like the idea of block congestion creating a fee market for them, without realising that medium to long term that will just drive people away from bitcoin, ultimately hurting the miners too.

Let's get this fixed now with the Litecoin protocol so a similar thing doesn't happen down the road with Litecoin.  People have been posting in bitcoin forums comments like, 'if only Satoshi had foreseen this issue and the protocol had been changed years ago...'.  (Well, they have been in the bitcoin forums that allow free debate....)  Well now's our chance with litecoin.

I'd switch a substantial part of my bitcoin investment to litecoin if litecoin went this way.Oh yes!Coblee will become, again, a hero of the crypto community if he did this.  Just as he saved Doge from a 51% attack and tried to save bitcoin from the spam transactions, I'd wager that 80%+ of bitcoiners would see this in good light.  

Only Blockstream's thugs and censors can screw things up over there; over here, it's up to us to ask coblee for the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, which is what we signed up for.  /u/CobleeI like it!Bitcoin HODLer here. I dont really understand how the litecoin community works, so what are the odds that this is really going to happen?

I am really frustrated with the neverending bitcoin blocksize debate. I would definitely consider moving a reasonable size of my btc holdings to ltc if I see this gaining traction.Let's go. 2mb blocks. Do it up. Saw this article on r/Bitcoin and just subscribed to this subreddit. I like Bitcoin, and I think it has something all the other cryptos don't have, the network effect, which leads to more hashing power/more secure blockchain. However, Bitcoin has a few weaknesses, 1) scalability - which litecoin seems to have solved, 2) anonymity - which Monero seems to have solvedI think BIP101 is too dangerous. There's a delicate balance between security, decentralization, transaction throughput, and miner fees. BIP101 will throw this out of whack and cause Bitcoin to lose security and decentralization. And the same will happen to Litecoin if BIP101 was implemented... of course at a much later time.

Most people don't understand the inner workings of how Bitcoin works. You cannot have the most secure network being highly decentralized and still get huge transaction throughput and low fees. Something has to give. In the case of Visa, you are giving up decentralization and fees, but you get security and throughput. If Bitcoin has 5000 nodes, then the marginal cost of a Bitcoin transaction will be 5000 times that of a Visa transaction. That's just the nature of decentralization. The cost is multiplied since each node has to do the same work as every other node. Today, Bitcoin has all four properties (security, decentralization, throughput, and low fees). This is ONLY because of miner rewards. When miner rewards trend towards 0, you will need to give up on some of these properties. Our response to the block size issue will determine what we give up.

BIP 101 increases the block size too quickly. This will destroy any chance of a fee pressure due to supply constraint. So by wanting to keep throughput and low fees, eventually security and decentralization will be destroyed. This would happen because miners will create large blocks that are not economical for the network to bear. This forces other miners to leave since they will be unprofitable. So, security and decentralization will be gone as block rewards decreases. What happened to Dogecoin will happen to Bitcoin and merged mining cannot rescue Bitcoin in this case.

This is not the Bitcoin I signed up for. I will make a longer post (maybe a blog post) to go into more details.Wow. He is good with his words. Posted this in another thread, linking here since the topics align

Heck, they can still use Visa if merchants are willing to pay the fees.

2015-12-20 11:27:10;BOA Crypto Currency Patent Granted - is this good?;Say bye bye to anon coins.Too bad some coins have anonymity built into the network, good lucky tracking that, wouldn't even be worth their investment requirement to do so. Anonymity is a human right, privacy is a human right. Fuck them for thinking they can just take it away. Don't let this shit go un-noticed. If we don't try to reclaim our privacy, they will have no issues continuing to degrade it. Pretty cool that Litecoin is mentioned in the patent.

Also solves a lot of other problems. Hopefully, this is what the Bitcoin community agree on and integrate."

Just passing along info.  Maybe the LTC community can do something like this?Getting more services to accept litecoin is not what we should focus on right now, we need more people using litecoin first. So did you send them an email? I'm not sure what Square's stance on crypto is. I believe they were accepting it on the online side but I didn't hear any news about them finally rolling it out to the B&M stores. 

What about Stripe? "

Something revolutionary starts up... it's great. So great it attracts people of like minds. They make it greater, attract more people. Too many people. They begin to create factions. Factions imprint agendas into the minds of their followers. People follow and fight for said agenda. Fewer and fewer factions survive the evolution. A few dominate, become corrupt, die.... then something revolutionary starts up...... repeat process.Divide and conquerIt's a perfect example of sheep mentality.

2016-01-03 06:38:34;5 Ways to Use Bitcoin (Litecoin mentioned at 4:58);Some arm movements
2016-01-02 22:53:22;[UPDATE] Litecoin 0.10.4 released! Update IMMEDIATELY;"**Release Notes**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What's New?**
This release of Litecoin core is an important update, featuring the BIP65 (CLTV) consensus change and bug fixes. The most notable changes are outlined below.

BIP65 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode
This release includes several changes related to the BIP65 soft fork which redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV) so that a transaction output can be made unspendable until a specified point in the future. This change paves the way for many new exciting features such as payment channels, time-locked refunds, escrow, two-factor wallets and is a major requirement for technologies like the lightning network.

This release will only relay and mine transactions spending a CLTV output if they comply with the BIP65 rules as provided in code.
This release will produce version 4 blocks by default. Please see the notice to miners below.
Once 951 out of a sequence of 1,001 blocks on the local node's best block chain contain version 4 (or higher) blocks, this release will no longer accept new version 3 blocks and it will only accept version 4 blocks if they comply with the BIP65 rules for CLTV.

For a detailed explanation about BIP65, you can view the documentation [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Notice to miners:**

*Litecoin Coreâs block templates are now for version 4 blocks only, and any mining software relying on its getblocktemplate must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either version v0.4.3 or any version from v0.5.2 onward.*

*If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade Litecoin Core, which must be done prior to BIP65 achieving its 951/1001 status.
If you are a P2Pool user, you must upgrade to the latest version which can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/forrestv/p2pool).
If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not affect you.
If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this will affect you at the pool operatorâs discretion, which must be no later than BIP65 achieving its 951/1001 status.*

You can track the progress of the soft fork roll out via this link:
[http://www.litecoinblockhalf.com/blocks.php](http://www.litecoinblockhalf.com/blocks.php)

Windows bug fix for corrupted UTXO database on unclean shutdowns
Several Windows users reported that they often need to reindex the entire blockchain after an unclean shutdown of Litecoin Core on Windows (or an unclean shutdown of Windows itself). Although unclean shutdowns remain unsafe, this release no longer relies on memory-mapped files for the UTXO database, which significantly reduced the frequency of unclean shutdowns leading to required reindexes during testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT**
All users using versions older then Litecoin Core 0.10.2.2 MUST upgrade to ensure that your signatures are encoded using 'low-s' ECDSA signature encoding scheme. Otherwise you run the risk of your transactions not being relayed once all miners upgrade. 

If you use Electrum, a release candidate version has also been released which ensures all transactions abide by the 'low-s' ECDSA encoding scheme. The release candidate version for Electrum can be found [here](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=18608.msg294483#msg294483).

If you use the Litecoin Android wallet, and are running an older version then 3.30.10. You will need to upgrade to 3.30.10 which can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet_ltc).

For a complete list of Litecoin Core specific changes, you can view the release notes [here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master-0.10/doc/release-notes-litecoin.md).

2016-01-02 00:19:44;[AMA] Official Litecoin Developers and Litecoin Association AMA 2016!;"Hello everyone and Happy New Year!

Some of the goals the developers and I have for 2016 are as follows:

* Increase our software coverage by releasing a new wallet for iOS devices (LoafWallet) and improve existing ones (Android and Electrum).
* Release Litecoin Core 0.12 which will feature block pruning, memory usage optimization, Tor stream isolation support and Tor hidden service support, improved signature validation using libsecp256k1, network performance improvements and additions (like ZMQ notifications) and many other changes. This will be a major release.
* Add support for version bits (BIP9) which allows rolling out multiple soft-forks at once instead of doing them sequentially. This will rapidly accelerate the roll out of new features.
* Add support for relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers. (BIP68 and BIP112)
* Add support for Segregated Witness. 
* Change P2SH address prefix to prevent confusion between Litecoin and Bitcoin addresses. This will require a hard fork and we would like to include any other changes which require a hard fork at the same time.
* Add support for cross-chain atomic transfers.
* Create a Litecoin sidechain to try out new opcodes, confidential transactions and other innovations.
* Add support for the Lightning network protocol.

Thank you in advance for participating in this AMA!A little update on the Litecoin Association

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**2016 Projects**

The Litecoin Association is working on a bunch of projects to improve Litecoin's infrastructure, and here are some of the development plans that we are in the process of organising, and also in the middle of working on: 

* **Updating LitecoinAssociation.org**: we're working on redesigning the website in order to allow us to communicate with everyone else a lot better. There will be teams - where you can contact specific team members easily; there will be a crowdfunding platform - allowing for community funded projects, and really shows what the community wants; there will be blogs - where all of our communications will be put into one place where everything will easily be available from us; artwork/press/litecoin branding information will all be available. BTW, a lot of the content is fake. Artilectinc is actually working on the pages this weekend. Here is a link to an album which contain pretty much the final designs of the website: [http://imgur.com/a/T7Ed0](http://imgur.com/a/T7Ed0)

* **LoafWallet on the App Store**: our long-awaited iOS Litecoin SPV wallet. The developer of Doughwallet and Litecoin Core Dev (thrasher) have been working hard on this, with 1 or 2 suggestions from Aaron Vosine (creator of BreadWallet). Currently I'd say best estimate for release would be by the end of Jan/Feb. We'd also like a slightly improved interface which /u/MLPfrank has worked on - thus far, these are just mock ups (some of don't have the background yet...) Take a look here: [http://imgur.com/a/etp69](http://imgur.com/a/etp69)

* **Block Size debate**: /u/MLPFrank and I are in the middle of creating a video on the Litecoin Association YouTube channel, this video will objectively describe the current issue, BIPs (advantages and drawbacks) and should help prepare people for a debate. We are planning a debate, with numerous influential personalities, on Litecoin's stance on the block size debate. Help us write the video's script by leaving comments on the document/script here:  [click me!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fTWql_KI7o97UpVDEuVS6uomBJJGeHd_VFB7w00iBsE/edit?usp=sharing)

* **Officially announce the LitecoinNode project**: for various reasons, this has yet to officially be announced. This will be done.

* **Litecoin Trademark Status**: progress is being made in regards to opposing the trademark application. The OHIM have notified us of some deficiencies in our argument, but we are attempting to resolve this.

* **LA YouTube videos**: more to be made. Incase you haven't seen this yet, take a [look here - click me!](https://www.youtube.com/user/LitecoinAssociation)



*I've probably forgotten some stuff, so please forgive me.*To anyone on the list who wants to answer: What are your thoughts on implementing anonymity features into Litecoin?/u/coblee you once mentioned: as Litecoin is more of an experimental network, you wouldn't mind adding BIP101...

Do you still keep these thoughts? Would you be open for some variation of BIP101 - i.e. smaller max block size, over a longer period of time....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/u/TheRealMage and /u/newb1_ltclearner 

The Litecoin Association has been struggling for 2015, which I think you'll agree in... Do you have any proposed methods to get out of this situation. Please advise the community of the current situation.

Meeting, we need to have them on the minimum once a month. And on a day people can come (not weekends).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/u/coblee and /u/wtogami

* Will Litecoin implement RBF?
* LTC development gets very little funding, how do you feel that we can gather funds? -would it be viable to do what DASH does, where a small percentage of newly mined crypto is automatically sent to devs. -or should the LA be utilised to gather funds from other companies which use LTC in their products?To all:

There is a considerable number of people who do not recognize the centralization that would be present if Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency.

Is a multi-crypto universe more secure and decentralized than one where only Bitcoin exists?

Why do many people ignore this, and say Litecoin (and other altcoins) are just scamcoins?  Is it purely self-interest of those heavily invested in Bitcoin?  Or is a single cryptocurrency ""good enough""?

... Why do you think it is important that Litecoin exists?
For /u/coblee question: It has been said that LTC will be accepted on Coinbase when he's ready. What are the conditions that need to have to be ready?To everyone involved: What are your thoughts on BIP101?* /u/coblee: when will Basecoin be on Coinlite?

*  /u/aspect_ : you said during the last AMA you were working with a financial institution to implement LTC, how is that going?  

* /u/TheRealMage : what's the status on koinyx? Has /u/Coblee read these posts by /u/Prohashing and if so, what are his arguments against upgrading to full BIP101:

http://forums.prohashing.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=701

http://forums.prohashing.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=685To all of the developers/LA attendees:

* When will the litecoin core update be released?
* When will any big US exchange Coinbase or Gemini offer litecoin? 
* What are your predictions for the price now when bitcoin is soon having its halvening and the current blocksize issue that they have?
* How much Litecoin are you currently holding(percentage or a estimate value eg. single digit,triple digit etc..)? Is there any chance we might see a block size increase bip merged into litecoin in 2016?

From what i understood, bip 101 has been ruled out, right?Hi Warren The task of litecoin lead dev probably has little reward for you, do you plan to continue this role indefinitely or gradually remove yourself from the role. Thanks in advanceÂ 

/u/wtogamiÂ In last year's map, there was talk about adding LTC at one of the ATM machine distributor. What happened, and will only happen soon?Thanks for doing this and for all the hardwork behind the scenes!
I have two questions/comments.

1. I like seeing a list of projects/timeline. Can this be something thats actively updated quarterly and posted on an easily accessible location like litecoin.com?

2. How can I help? I have no programming ability, artistic ability, etc. I dont own a business or have close connections to anyone who does. I also couldnt sell ice water to a guy in Hell.
What I do have is multiple full nodes running the Litecoin Core client (a VPS as well as 2 home networks). I also try to keep atleast one miner running to help secure the network, even its running at a loss profitwise. I actively buy Litecoin whenever I can and spend it if at all possible vs fiat. Hi everyone and happy new year!

How do you feel about state of mining centralization currently experiencing by Litecoin network, both geagraphical and institutional?To the Devs: If there's to be a hard fork to change P2SH prefixes, why not at the same time raise the blocksize limit to something like 2mb? Even though the transaction volume doesn't require it, it would show that Litecoin is more progressive.My question is for everyone listed, 
       
Do you yourself actively mine Litecoin?When will we see main stream adoption?When does /u/Coblee think Litecoin will actually ""mewn""? 

Do you think this will be tied to Bitcoin's success or will we have a chance at an independent, ""secular"" bull market for LTC? 

Do you think we could actually replace Bitcoin as the highest priced, most used cryptocurrency? What would that take?Do you agree Theymos is doing bitcoin a favor by controlling the discussion on /r/bitcoin? And do you think /r/btc is just a majority of trolls and shills or misinformed followers working to damage bitcoins image?why is not coblee in the house?:)I mean here at AMA,not being here price plumet:)where is waren does he still work on here,whatz up with hashrate future?bitcoin hashrate rising fast,does somebody see Litecoin in the future same rise or at least a bit.Thanks team for all the work done,lets make the 2016 a Litecoin Year.it would be awesome if Litecoin have some kind of Voting system similar to DashCoin.

We lost $200 trying to withdrawal bitcoins and litecoins from Cryptsy in early November, because those withdrawals weren't processing and the dogecoin price had diverged because of it.

If you have money there, start taking documentation of what you are owed so you can sue or file in the bankruptcy, which means taking screenshots of your balances in all coins as well as your failed withdrawal requests.  There are reports that they have been editing their database to change balances.[deleted]End of Cryptsy basically mean, the End of 500 Other SHitCoin/PumpCoin.

Mid term I think no difference.Yuen = devalued
Chinese stocks = down?

commodities = upno relation, but i know people good at economics can make up some relationshipChinese markets crash, LTC is steady Eddie. I think their market crashes have to be a trend and the realization of correction is impossible  without full collapse before you see a significant rise in the demand (price) of BTC/LTCI would say a good effect on BTC which in turn helps LTC.  The crypto of choice in China I think is still BTC.People say LTC is the crypto of choice in China to make themselves feel better.

This whole blocksize debate sounds like it wasn't actually a debate at all and Theymos was doing everything in his power to make sure larger blocks were not adopted. It most likely has been an orchestrated effort to ensure the business model of the lightning network being developed by blockstream did not fail.

This poison pill has been just one of many attempts to derail movement away from bitcoin core

Lol /r/litecoin getting retarded too?Not sure why you think this dudes shady. He appears completely...something.Do not post trash from the troll r/btc sub. That sub is anti bitcoin/litecoin.People sure like their drama. 

Summary: luke jr submits troll patch to bitcoin classic, gmaxwell makes comment about it, people get fired up and posts long drama laden rant on r/bitcoin .

The funny thing is luke jr is actually correct. Switching the POW would actually allow them to switch to whatever blocksize proposal they want because they are never going to get the current bitcoin miners on board.

It's not us who haven't updated from a very old version of Litecoin. But we do try to contact people (who run supernodes, electrum servers, exchanges and the such) to quickly update. 

In my opinion, the number of unconfirmed transactions isn't that high enough to be considered a problem. Something like if BTC-e not upgrading would be a problem though.

If you haven't already updated to the latest version of Litecoin (v0.10.4), please do so from [Litecoin.org](https://Litecoin.org)!I'm still waiting for my ltc.25hrs already!ELI5

2016-01-17 05:34:31;Anybody up for a blockchain-based Litecoin Trading Card for Spells of Genesis?;"oh yes! please!Need a coblee card.A Lite unite card, stability and zen. Litecoin waits quietly and watch other currencies growing up in chaos. Litecoin only adopt changes when they're proven successful and necessary. A safe haven, neutral ground in the world of crypto.

That's what Litecoin means to me. I'm looking forward to see a SoG card of Litecoin. 

Thanks in advanceSounds great!  As long as they aren't (M)agic (T)he (G)athering cards for obvious reasons.























I'd love to see this game released, is there anywhere we can sign up to get news of if/when this is released?the more the merrier! Great initiative and looking forward to the first designs :) would love it!All right everyone, the card is in the works. The team hopes to have it ready next week. I'll be posting the card when is ready. Thanks everyone for the support shown."
2016-01-17 00:06:43;funny Check the end 3:30;"Hitler was right.this one also pretty good one :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKhCeu0JENAI've seen this so many times, it's become seriously unfunny. But not this time.I know this was meant to be a joke, but don't take that video too seriously about what is actually going on. Mike Hearn didn't pull the classiest move with his departure, but he brought up very good points that the bitcoin needs to address. It sounds like we are closer to a block size consensus with bitcoin classic, however we still have the issue of conflicts of interests and censorship with theymos remaining as mod of /r/bitcoin. But by tying bitcoin to Hitler's last ditch effort aren't you in effect saying that Mike Hearn is right. We know Hitler loses, i'm not sure you strengthen the position of the probitcoin argument. If you wanted to attack his position, Mike Hearn should have been Hitler and the probitcoin community should have been the allies, you would have then inferred that Mike Hearn was doomed with his last ""ditch"" effort., and that ultimately the Probitcoin community won in the end...It was still hilarious thoughï»¿"

2016-01-23 17:12:05;Before things get TOO crazy...;"At the moment, it appears Prohashing is listening to Coblee on the matter. Prohashing isn't trying to create a fork, like Classic vs Core on Bitcoin, instead he's presenting one of the possible solutions as a pull request, and offering assistance developing a solution if one is decided upon.

It would however be beneficial if /u/coblee could create a public statement on here on how we're going to future-proof Litecoin, even if only a list of potential solutions with their considerations.Haven't seen much from /u/coblee publicly in the recent weeks. It's not good for LTCThis divergence you see in Bitcoin and a tearing apart isn't the way I see it. Consensus on the best direction should be from a groundswell of many minds coming together. We have this with the old money system, a few people behind closed doors pulling strings usually motivated by greed and hidden agendas.    

We'll see what comes to pass with Bitcoin, however I fully expect a hard fork to take place that will both raise the block size and loosen the grip core has on development this is a good thing for obvious reasons that should be clear to even the casual observer.    

We don't need one pro hashing only we need 100 to get involved surely better than a couple of devs, Charles in the back seat and warren when he's paid enough. 



If Coblee will provide a decision of block's size problem in the nearest future, Litecoin will have a chance to become a real digital silver, not just a Bitcoin little brother."
2016-01-23 16:43:43;Forecasting Litecoin;"its going to blow up(good thing) with all of the economic problems occuring around the world(especially china).Well, I think we will see unpeg from bitcoin in terms of price discovery. Many of litecoiners got too used to price moving in accordance with bitcoin one and forgot how quickly order of things could change in cryptomarket world.

I expect in some point bitcoin blockchain become unusable due to capacity issue. Maybe a serious upstrike in transaction volume or dos attack. I think we all know what will happen next. In case of that triple digit litecon to USD is possible. And don't tell me that without bit all the cryptomarket is doomed, it is likely to say that without mtgox and silkroad bitcoin is doomed, we all know its not the case.i belive 10$ - 18$  or even past thatYou'll know by the BTC halving in July. If you're taking food out of your baby's mouth to buy LTC, I wouldn't. If you're operating in the black then I certainly encourage a LTC investment like right now. I've always been in the mindset of ""I'm going to ride the bus until the wheel fall off."" And still am.

That being said, I think LTC will be .02 BTC or approximately $10 this summer. But it could certainly be way less than what it is now. Us hobbyist really have no control of its fate. I see many people, especially in China trading to litecoin to avoid uncertainty and instability within bitcoin.  How much this affects the $$ price depends how things develop in bitcoinland but I'm certainly expecting swings in the btc/ltc rate.I'm guessing it'll crash. China exchanges run into problems with the government. The manipulation comes to an end. LTC dumps. I have 100% faith in the Litecoin/Bitcoin relationship and am very eager for BitcoinClassic to seal the deal. "
2016-01-23 13:47:57;Litecoin under attack (once again);"Dude !!! i cant believe you forgot about PayCoin !!!
remember the PayCoin IPO Promise, they said company would buy them back for like $20. hahaha. The company did the opposite and just Dump it out those useless coin. Litecoin's market cap is about the same now as before. How is this an attack on litecoin? Just because someone else is doing well doesn't mean they're attacking you.

We're all pretty much on the same side here. The real competitor is fiat. All cryptocurrencies together make up less than 1/10,000 of the global money supply; we should focus on fixing that, instead of pulling each other down like crabs in a bucket.Pro tip : when they invade the sub with their flawed logic (""ma coin so great Litecoin will disappear..."") you know the massive dump of their wonderful coin on noobs and fools is less than 2 weeks away...Top post here talks about how everyone should be civil to Litecoin.  From the other side this is not looked at as an attack.

One flaw in your logic though:

>Come talk to me when your coin is on all the major Chinese exchanges.

If that happened the price of said crypto would just go higher (much higher), no?

I was trading cryptos for too long to believe eherium hype will last for too long. In 4 or 6 months same hypers will chase the next unicorn.

For me as investor some coin has long-term future if its community and ecosystem survived a couple of years lying at rock bottom and didn't tare itself apart. Only know no more than five of such ones.We should ask ourselves if it is smoke and mirrors, or is there something real underneath all of the hype. Is it a real threat to Litecoin, or is it just another passing fad like those that have come and gone. Developers have invested precious time. Miners have invested resources. Community members have invested their engagement. It is imperative for all involved to take a step back and objectively assess what is really going on.âWe have to let go of the notion that in order for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace the notion that in order for Apple to win, Apple has to do as a really good job. If we screw up and not do a good job, itâs not someone elseâs fault, itâs our faultâI don't think any of those are an attack on litecoin.  Unless you think litecoin is an attack on bitcoin?  Crypto is like an ecosystem, it's healthy to have competition.  Makes all of us better.Thank you. Don't forget Vertcoin, they also said the same[deleted]I just received 2 spam msgs telling me to go ethereum.  

I never received a single spam message telling me to go litecoin.  

Case closed for me.  I'm not interested in the price of other coins.
I do not think the growth of another attack on Litecoin.
Litecoin need as soon as possible:
- IOS wallet
-The Solution for the block size.
- Someone who will be engaged in marketing professional.
P.S.
I think that our developers have a solution for the block size, but not published for reasons of solidarity with Bitcoin and its problems.
bossmanishere, you cannot have this attitude and expect to succeed and be taken seriously. I'm sorry, but I need to say that this is much more of a hindrance than a help.Thanks for this, I was beginning to almost have to put money in another coin.Thank you! Lots of truant highschoolers running around these days given the Bitcoin problems and the Premine Foundation thinking they are meaningful in any way. How strange...It's heart wrenching Nobody cares about litecoin enough to attack it. It's a COMPLETELY useless alt-coin being kept alive by 1000 or so bagholders who try to convince each other it will magically go to the moon some day. 
You people are even more delusional than bitcoiners. Which is an amazing thing to achieve.

2016-01-23 13:16:47;Trolls, and why we support upgrading litecoin;"Bossman is not a troll, but I think he misinterpreted your goals, which I fully support.  Then the trolls came in that post.

2016-01-31 09:46:54;Litecoin is just a clone of bitcoin with some variables changed..;"This isn't true.  If it had been true, it wouldn't have taken me 55 hours so far to convert the BIP101 solution to litecoin.

At one time, litecoin and bitcoin were the same with a few variables changed.  Then, each development team started adding new things to each coin and they diverged.  There are more bitcoin developers, so bitcoin got ahead of litecoin over time, with many features never having made it across.  In particular, bitcoin has been ""refactored"" quite a bit over the years to make code easier to understand, even when the new code doesn't do anything differently than the old software does.  Much of this refactoring never made it to litecoin.

While features can be brought in one at a time, there is a trend in altcoins towards making minimal changes and being able to simply copy them into every new bitcoin version.  For example, reddcoin developer /u/cryptognasher has plans to ""rebase"" his coin on the latest version of bitcoin.  If he succeeds, then reddcoin will support all the types of transactions bitcoin supports.

Since litecoin has not been ""rebased"" in a very long time, it differs significantly from bitcoin and is not a clone.The biggest difference is the use of the Scrypt algorithm to produce signatures instead of SHA-256. Scrypt is much harder to accelarate via custom hardware than SHA-256, because its a ""memory-hard"" problem. It requires the use of memory which is slow, unlike SHA-256. So this should make litecoin more resistent to being managed by a small group high-volume miners. It has the potencial to be a lot more decentralized than Bitcoin.The Chinese Yuan is a clone of the dollar. The dollar is a clone of the pound sterling, which is a clone of the Roman imperial token. The Romans copied it from the Byzantines... 

All these bitcoiners thinking they are revolutionaries need to learn some history. There never was and isn't going to be a World Currency.You can not just use the small part of the quote that you liked. Not a fan of Maxwell in the current Blocksize Crisis but this is the true qoute:

> Cryptosystem work is very difficult, and Bitcoin seems to have resulted in people thinking that creating this stuff is no big deal since they can just copy the code... **but in a cryptosystem the details matter, greatly**... a single line changed can have subtle effects that ruin the security properties completely. - G. Maxwell

Unless you have another source for your qoute?Have you lost your hopium? I haven't brothaIt's up to the people what's valuable, Silver is like Gold a bit different but people still buy silver and gold.http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c90/sc4087/Notthisagain.jpg"

That was literally the whole point for the creation of cryptocurrencies.

I've purchased BTC and DOGE through Celery in the past, but I've also had lots of Celery transactions fail.

Just because (now i am generalizing) all rich and got in early doesnt mean they have the slightest clue about networking and whats best for bitcoin.

The large holders and developers should've been a) upgrading LTC to BIP 101 or a flexible cap and b) meeting with dark net marketplace operators, gambling websites, prediction market websites, exchanges, mining pools, and encouraging them to add LTC. 

LTC has 4x bitcoin's capacity. That just means that we'd reach LTCs cap (at a delayed time) and then have the same exact controversy that bitcoin is having. Litecoin's average expected block time is supposed to be around 2.5 minutes (150 seconds). That's four times faster than Bitcoin's average intended time. The max number of Litecoins' is also 4 times Bitcoin's 21 million. That means that Litecoin inflation is supposed to happen at a similar rate to that of Bitcoin - back by 2/3 years.[deleted]The other coin takes under a minuteLitecoin should change to SHA256 mining then the big Chinese miners can switch immediately to LTC in order btc would split in two chains or even fail. That could give to LTC a real boost. The idea is probably crazy but can be a real option for Litecoin as longer as I am thinking about it!What size are litecoin blocks currently?"
2016-03-04 07:15:31;Why aren't the Litecoin BIP32 serialization values updated in Litecoin Core source?;"The Ltub/Lptv convention was originally made up by the author of bip32.org ([source](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=406386.0)) before BIP32 support was officially added to Litecoin Core, so it had the time to gain some minor traction in other software.

However, xpub/xprv is the officially supported format for Litecoin, just like it is for Bitcoin. This way, a single hierarchical deterministic extended key can easily be used to generate addresses for multiple cryptocurrencies.I'd say HD defines the protocol of deriving child keys and is not blockchain specific.  
&nbsp;  
FYI,  
Each child keys may be blockchain specific (LTC, DOGE etc...) a standard was proposed in [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) and coin derivation can be found [here](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)"

use their faucet lists, hide the dud ones (there aren't many) and use another address as a referral (extra payout). I've been faucetting a week now, about 1/2 hour a day and I have nigh on 6 million litoshi (currently about 13 euro cents). Don't listen to the neigh-sayers, just get involved, have some fun and enjoy looking at your virtual coins.

2016-03-13 15:49:13;How to import wallet.dat to Electrum-LTC?;"No, you can't just copy the file, as Electrum uses a different format.

The best way to switch to Electrum is to send all the litecoins you have on your old wallet to one of the addresses on your Electrum wallet. This way you'll have all your litecoins secured with your seed. You could import the private keys from your old client, but in that case you would have to backup those keys separately, as they won't become part of your Electrum seed.I recommend importing your Litecoin core private key into the electrum client. Here's a video made by the LA showing and explaining how to do just that: https://youtu.be/TevLN_k-GWA

You'll need to export the key from the core wallet first then import it into electrum. Hope this helps :)"

Coblee said he'll quit if Coinbase doesn't add Litecoin.

We just need to give them a few more years ...WowOh, grow up, people! ""I hear you loud and clear. Thank you for sharing this!"" means NOTHING! Mr. Armstrong might have replied this way to a hundred different suggestions. It is what it is. Is there really any reason to make it more than that?What is happening why is coinbase mad?His reply doesn't mean a damn thing. I seriously doubt CoinBase would ever add ETH to there service, and if they did. More then likely Litecoin would be added way before they add that scam coin... Just because he hasn't replied here about Litecoin being added, doesn't mean they don't plan on adding it in the future. I mean the creator does work for them... I'm sure they probably talk about this multiple times a week/month. It's only a matter of time before they eventually add LTC to CoinBase. Just be patient guys. It will all be worth it in the end. "
2016-04-03 18:40:54;Reasons for rapid rise and drop of price in Litecoin?;"what time periods are you referring to? From pennies to $48 was due to BTC going from $10 to $1,000 and making everyone rich and that spilled over into LTC, PPC, NMC, FTC, NVC. So it wasn't because LTC had something special going for it.

Price TANKED to $1 cause really no one wants the coin. Then the first ever halving coming up. It's quiet and no other coins are doing anything.

So some whales start buying and soon the masses start. Game of chicken. Price tanks to $2.50 after the buying stops.

Then the whales who unloaded all their LTC on new bagholders went to another coin. 

Now the price is being held up by those poor halving bagholders. 

Now people are waiting for this roadmap which probably won't be much different from what we already know from past AMA's with the foundation. 

The only remaining hope is China. Whatever shady things they are up to. bw.com pool now mines the most coins. Top 3 pools are from China and control 82.4%

People are putting their faith and money into a coin that pumped 2 times for no good reason. Supply and demand cycle.i think it might actually have something to do with people just being assholes"

2016-04-03 13:30:49;Is there anything we can do as a community to revive Litecoin?;"Necromancy! (You can't revive what is not dead). Now seriously: one thing that appears as a problem is also a nice benefit. Litecoin is used widely and would be used far more if some interesting features would be added or copied from many interesting projects out there. Bitcoin is pretty mainstream but very hard to modify. Litecoin follows but should be far easier to improve and modify. I think ANY feature would skyrocket it's value.We need back the communication forum ltctalk and make it more safe,IOS,Electrum Android,need 4 update in litecoinlearner website,need 4 easy access on mining equipment so that users dont fall in the scams.
Maybe organizing a hackfest 4 Litecoin Core to find vulnerabilities and make the code more secure.We need to re architect services in the net,
we need to redistribute services back towards the edge,we need to devirtualize the servers where your life is stored and we need to restore some autonomy to you as the owner of the server,the measure for taking those steps are technical as usual the box filter are ahead of us,the hardware isn't the constraint,as usual nowadays the software isn't that deeper constraint either because we made so much wonderful software which is in fact being used by all the guys in the bad architecture.Developing an IOS wallet would be a good start! Something like breadwallet for litecoins would be great!I'd recommend waiting for our roadmapð¥I was talking about MT about this not too long ago, and trying to kick around some ideas to ignite Litecointalk.org. Well, we know what happened to Litcointalk. 

But that's neither here nor there. I think the LA tried quite hard over 2014 and some of 2015 to generate some momentum with industry and financial instituations, but during that time everyone was in a wait and see period with Bitcoin...and at present day, in a well I accept BTC period, why confuse people with LTC? And folks that loved LTC have come on this sub and tried to kick around novel marketing ideas and were basically shunned for their ideas. So for better or worse, I think LTC will for ever be the silver medal.

As for the developers, they have maintained core advancements with BTC, for little to no pay. That's worth something to me, but I do hope this roadmap gives the community a little more faith in LTC's fate. I think we have a hard pill to swallow: If Warren and Charlie abandon LTC it very much could dwindle away. That or if the Chinese find a new doll to play with. But remember, the Chinese infrastructure makes up 80% of the mining compliment, so I can't see all of that hardware going by the way side.

We did give ways routinely last year and it was really fun to execute, but not sure it did anything for the coin. 

We're in a wait and see mode, in my opinion. I think LTC at this juncture is self-supporting digital token, that's as stable as they come. Getting a forum populated with a bunch of hypsters will to little to nothing for LTC's value or exposure. I do wish there was a little more energy around here and hope that LTC doesn't fade to black like PPC or NMC. 

* fix the forum(litecointalk) with a secure forum(like the one theymos has developed haha) 
* get the roadmap up on social media(Medium,Twitter,reddit and a personal website like bitcoin core did)
* fix the communication between Companies & developers though(Slack,skype,google hangouts etc)
* Get the iOS up on the app store and spread it though social media to companies and merchants.From someone who is interested in virtual currency but freaked out by the risks, allow me to buy and sell them easily (one click immediate credit or debit) and most importantly store them on a debit type card in my wallet.

I'm entirely outside the realm but tried to get into it and had no patience for the convoluted machinations you have to go through to set up a wallet and buy and sell. My perception? Too complicated. Too risky. Do what you will with the opinion.>Is there anything we can do as a community to revive Litecoin?

Practical.  Down to Earth and relevant to their lives.  No theories or visions about the future.
How can he/she/them do it?

Maybe your old .dat had some new private keys/addresses in it that had some balance you forgot about.

If you don't mind moving the coins, send them to another address and see if the 10X amount shows up, or if the client errors and says you don't really have that much to send.even if you get x10 shown balance you would not be able to spend it."

It just wouldn't replace Visa. It can still be a gold replacement even as it is.I don't think that there is one.If you are talking about the roadmap that was recently mentioned on this sub... It's not a 'roadmap' for Litecoin core's development. It's to do with the litecoin association afaik. 



And if things couldn't get worse it looks like okcoin may be adding the coin that cannot be named here. A certain link with the coin leads to a different page recently. So if you hold ltc it may go down a bit as people switch coins if added to okcoin. 

But hey more cheap coins for you. Only 3 more years till the next halving pump if this coin is still relevant. Clear no to the classic supporters.

I had wanted to have it released by now however we're still waiting on a response from Thomas Voegtlin of Electrum to inform the last bit of the road map. I'm pushing for an update on the forum which has been less than simple, but we may finally have that resolved, otherwise I'll be leaving it out. Core have provide a timescale that will now be included. I've also been in talks with some other team members and I've made the decision that we're holding it to release with software, no later. I want us to show results not just words.

So the big question, How long?

~2-3 weeks (Hopefully) I understand I said 'soon' weeks ago and you're going to hold me to that as you should. This is an estimate i will update if it needs to be revised and when a final date is realized it will be announced. Losh and co have been working tirelessly to fix issues and get stuff ready and I can't thank them enough for their hard work and time. 

If you have any questions about anything please ask away.It'll be released very soon I hope.

No one can guarantee if the ratio won't break 0.005. Your mind and your interest won't hang in till then. Roadmap? it's the dangerous hope people still have about LTC developers. They are exhausted and busy and probably don't have as many litecoins as you do. Not complaining or blaming about them, it's personal choice and interest to have LTC or even hold it. If your view is not for super long term, just convert. I make poor decisions. I'm diversifying my play money to: 33% LTC 33% BTC 33% metals 1% concept design new ideas.really???

2016-05-07 22:20:21;Haven't used litecoin in a while, sent 0.1 ltc transaction as a test, but never confirmed?;"If you sent a transaction from an unsynced Litecoin Core wallet, it shouldn't matter, as your transaction should have been already sent. But the fee calculations may have been messed up.

If you don't want to sync Litecoin Core and use those coins in another wallet which doesn't require syncing, I would recommend: [Electrum](https://electrum-ltc.org). All you have to do is go to Litecoin Core, then open settings and open up the console and write:


>dumpprivkey

That should return a private key. After you've done that, open up Electrum-LTC and then when it asks for a private key on initial setup, type that in. If you want your coins to be kept safe, you should probably send coins back to yourself to another receive address shown in Electrum.If you go into the settings, and then console of Litecoin Core, and use `dumpprivkey`, you can get your private keys.

You can import the keys into [Electrum](https://electrum-ltc.org/) (desktop light-wallet), or [LiteVault](https://www.litevault.net) (web wallet, similar to Blockchain.info, i.e. you still stay in control of your keys); both of which should allow you to spend your coins immediately. No syncing."
2016-05-07 13:46:29;new to cryptocurrency, interested in LTC, need some hints;"1. In my opinion the answer to question one would be to first purchase Bitcoin from Coinbase.com. They allow for debit card purchases, and are the most well known Bitcoin company. You then use Shapeshift.io to convert Bitcoin to Litecoin. Shapeshift.io do not store your Bitcoins/Litecoins and therefore you balance should be safe. 

2. There are a bunch of options you can use to safely store your Litecoins. You can use [Electrum-LTC](https://electrum-ltc.org) and then go to the menu and select 'File < New/Restore < Hardware Wallet' this should let you use a Trezor to safely store Litecoin offline on a hardware wallet. Option two would be to use something like [liteaddress.org](https://liteaddress.org) to generate a printable LTC wallet.

3. /r/Litecoin would be the best place to ask any information about Litecoin. I wouldn't use a USB to store Litecoin wallets as they just tend to randomly die. BTC-e is one of the most popular Litecoin exchanges, but they are anonymous and no one knows who they are,  so at a moments notice they could just disappear with all your Litecoins. Another large tip, never store your Litecoins on an exchange, always withdraw it as soon as possible; it's not just the threat of them stealing your coins (some exchanges are safe and backed by insurance), but also a hacker.Hey welcome,

1. Here's the LA's guide on buying Litecoin quickly and safely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgo68YboNJg

2. I would suggest using either Core if you want to hold a copy of the blockchain (every transaction in litecoins history) or electrum if you prefer a lightweight alternative. With both you can make as many backups as you want. you can find a download to all current wallets on the official Litecoin website: https://litecoin.com/ 

3. The LA have a bunch of videos thoroughly and concisely explaining litecoin on YouTube if you want to learn more i highly recommend checking it out: https://www.youtube.com/user/LitecoinAssociation/videos



 The most reliable exchange for me, has always been https://btc-e.com - of course Coinbase and Circle allows you to deposit straight from your bank or credit/debit card, then you can exchange the Bitcoin's via ShapeShift (instant exchange), or BTC-e

While BTC-e are ""shady"", they've ran safely for much longer than both Cryptsy and MtGox now (two ""non-shady"" regulated exchanges which both went bankrupt and ran away with money).

If you're in the EU, https://www.litecoinlocal.net is the localbitcoins for Litecoin (there may also be some US sellers, but we're mostly popular in the EU)

As for wallets, you can use either Electrum or Litecoin Core for a local wallet, or LiteVault (https://www.litevault.net) for an online wallet similar to Blockchain.info (yes you keep your keys, we don't see them at any point)By now before its to latehttps://www.kraken.com/Buy Bitcoin and use Shapeshift.ioHowtobuyltc.comFocus on BTC.Everyone is trying to steal your money.

2016-05-05 17:58:35;Gemini adds.... Very SAD....;"Extremely sad to hear this, clearly a large number of people were asking for the addition of Litecoin for a very long time. But it seems like Gemini has decided to jump into making quick profit by using short term trending technologies.

I do believe that Ethereum has a good purpose that is seem to fulfil, but I am saddened by the lack of addition of Litecoin along with Ethereum. It's not like a large number of people have been asking for the addition of Litecoin ever since Gemini initiated Bitcoin trading. Ethereum has only gather followers very recently, and it seems like a bad decision.why is it sad?

""We Have To Let Go Of This Notion That For Apple To Win, Microsoft Has To Lose""I'm surprised that Gemini added Ethereum when security of the platform is still in question. The volume of Litecoin traded still blows away Ethereum by a long shot.

http://cryptocoincharts.info/coins/graphicalComparisonWhy is adding Ethereum ""sad""?  Does Litecoin's success require Ethereum's failure?

Vitalik is constantly on the road giving interviews, doing presentations and writing posts about his plans for Ethereum's future.  The companies that write Etherreum only applications, particularly Consensys, are out and about promoting Ethereum and forging links with corporations.  Ultimately, this work pays off with developments like the one you've posted today.

Do we really believe Coblee and the Litecoin team are working as hard as the Ethereum team to promote and develop Litecoin?Nice news.. eth have a great dev team fully dedicated really cool technology and this is just the begining.. look at the DAO 20mil $ so farpanic sell.That explains the LTC exit pump a few days ago."
2016-05-15 16:39:33;Cup & handle - LTC starting new pump;"So confirmation if ltc breaks out over $4.10?The resistance could be coming from the same spot as BTC. 

http://i.imgur.com/ObA9U9F.png

The first box on the left is support and 2nd box is the price touching the resistance. Then you can see the price is currently hitting the resistance. It was broken twice but quickly sold back down. 

Much easier to send LTC up 30% which is like $5.50 or so. With BTC they gotta pump to around $600 to see 30% increase. 

If LTC gets good anon, hell might break loose. That would mean the main advantage XMR and DASH have, plus the biggest volume in crypto plus China love. I hope we will see something like 2013 or the latest ETH pump.Could just be the reduced supply of the last halving are finally kicking in. Rumor has it OKCoin adding a new coin very soon. Won't change the fact LTC is about to hit new short term highs so will be interesting to see what happens."

2016-05-13 12:45:00;Just wondering;It's advisable to just buy LTC, and not bother mining at this time.Not a good idea to mind LTC with a GPU for over two years now. Don't think your card is good enough to mine ETH either, but it's probably profitable to mine feathercoin and trade that to LTC or something, unless you have very high electricity rate.Gpus are long since dead in terms of mining. Asics can only be considered if your power is 100% free, and even then ROI is a very long time (months).If your dead set on using your mining potential if I were you I'd consider mining a low market cap coin/s (such as Vertcoin) which a couple times a year has a mega pump and dump which you could sell into? Other than that considering Litecoin its worth just buying it unless your electricity cost is none existent.

2016-05-22 13:01:05;What is the state of litecoin development and who are some active developers?;"Litecoin is still activity being developed by its core team, there are currently 5 developers working on Litecoin core:

*  Charlie (/u/coblee) - Litecoin creator / Director of Engineering at Coinbase
*  Warren (/u/wtogami) - Lead Developer of Litecoin Core
* Adrian (/u/thrasher_au) - Release Manager/ Litecoin Core Developer
* Pooler (/u/ltcpooler) - Maintainer of Electrum LTC
* Anton (/u/aspect_)

The Litecoin Association is a group of volunteers and community members who came together to help maintain and build Litecoins resources such as Litecoin.com, the official wiki and educate the public via ad-free videos freely available on YouTube. The LA is:

* Andrew (/u/TheRealMage) - LA Director
* Phil (/u/newb1_ltclearner) - LA Director
* Eric (/u/Carnth) - LA Director
* Jason (SeansOutpost) - LA Director
* Losh (/u/losh11) - Developer
* Frank (/u/mlpfrank) - Graphic/Video Designer

The LA will be announcing it's upcoming plans and projects in it's roadmap. Core is also currently working on Litecoin and a brief update from them will be included in the LA roadmap. The two teams do work together but ultimately Litecoin is under the Core team control.

Another notable developer in the community who built litevault.net. a trustless online web wallet for Litecoin is /u/someguy123_ 
To anyone looking to get involved in Litecoin Development or just help out contact an LA member. Hope this helps.Here is some useful information complete with a link to AMA by developers. I still hold bitcoin; but, like the security and faster transactions of litecoin.

- Capable of four times as many transactions as Bitcoin in a ten minute period. Frankly if payment processors had adopted Litecoin in the past year current Bitcoin block discussions would be irrelevant (and likely the price of both coins higher). Anyone who has watched these discussions understands the immediate advantage of a network with larger transactional capability.

- Faster confirmation times. The only people who don't think this is important have never spent a single coin or they have patience that the average person does not possess.

- The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks.

- Anti-spam.

- Fast well established network. Current Hashrate is 1,643 GH/s. Since scrypt is memory intensive it is known to be approximately 1000 times slower hardware wise in comparison to SHA256. Fair comparison to the Bitcoin network requires multiplying that hashrate by 1000 (1,643 TH/s). The fact is for most of Litecoins history the hashrate has been relatively high and secure. Those comparing it to the Bitcoin network without considering this 1k factor are either being disingenuous or just ignorant of the facts.

- Continuous development look here at number of releases in past year: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/releases 

- Upcoming new features and active development look here for whats happening in 2016: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/3z2ta1/ama_official_litecoin_developers_and_litecoin/

- Longevity. Many coins have temporarily eclipsed litecoin as they were marketed for the purpose of increasing the fiat accounts of a small group and emptying the accounts of new users. Unfortunately this has been detrimental to crypto-space in general.

- Great community.

- Fully supported by GoCoin a growing merchant payment processor used by thousands of merchants https://www.gocoin.com/ as well as other processors such as coinpayments, Asmoney, Alfacoins and Coinify

- Liquidity. You can sell thousands and not crash the market. Maintains value. Look at the chart here indicating volume in the last 24 hours relative to other coins. http://cryptocoincharts.info/coins/graphicalComparison In fact volume has remained high since last June while maintaining a stable price.


 Fast confirmations.  Decentralized.  Fair launch.  Fair distribution - Low price means anybody has had access (for years) to cheap litecoins.

Litecoin is not premined.  I can not sensibly buy a pre-mined token like the many out there that are being pumped right now.Second most secure network after bitcoin, second market cap if you exclude ipo / premined non proof of work tokens, one of the oldest crypto tested for years and working just fine.
That's what you get with Litecoin.

Also faster transactions than bitcoin and a capacity to handle 4 times more transactions per minutes than bitcoin so we have way more time to handle the scalability problem if we ever reach the wall bitcoin is runing into right now.

So let's be serious, people telling you it have no development... it makes no sense, how could Litecoin be where it is now without development ?
But if by development you think about gimmicky features added every weeks to pump the price, keep the traders entertained and calm their anxiety, well, no it's not Litecoin.
Litecoin is about security, stability and does not add whatever feature unless needed and tested.There are other developments in LTC beyond core development. For instance there is a wallet called multiexplorer that supports litecoin. Its a web based wallet that is open source, so you can run it on your own server. It also uses the blockchain.info model where the server does not have control of the user's private key.It's a good question because 'nobody' seems to know, there is basically no communication from them. Having said that, Litecoin is very reliable and I've never had a confirmation take longer than a few minutes.Sorry to say.. you won't what you're looking for with Litecoin. I own some myself, though not as much as previously. I've followed it ever since its first days. Even mined some in those early heady days. But no more.

Litecoin is NOT under active development. The dev team can't even come up with a roadmap promised some time ago and long overdue.

If you're looking for *the new bitcoin*, look at DASH.Yes, a copy of Bitcoin. Surely it won't run into the same problems being a fork and all. "

2016-05-29 13:07:42;Litecoin and Smart Contracts ?;"Counterparty protocol will soon be offering Ethereum virtual machine on top of Bitcoin blockchain. The functionality of this port will be not only same as ethereum but will offer some neat features for working with counterparty assets. Why am I saying this? Because I remember some months ago I made a post here that LTC devs should think about porting counterparty protocol (which sits on top of Bitcoin blockchain) on top of Litecoin blockchain. It really should't be too difficult because BTC and LTC virtually the same. So yeah it is possible to have smart contracts on top of Litecoin blockchain. By the way counterparty was even ported to Dogecoin and has name Dogeparty, you can check it at https://coindaddy.io/I hope there will be smart contracts running on top or on sidechains of Litecoin, we definitely need some devs to work on this because this could be priority number one :

Ethereum is moving full PoS soon, wich is a mistake, but they can't afford the level of security required for Bitcoin or Litecoin, because no asic miners... 
(PoW is superior in many ways and clearly more secure)
The value is in the network and Litecoin have the second strongest network. Combine that with smart contracts capabilities and no immediate full blocks problem it could be unstoppable...
As sidechains are coming for Litecoin and will de facto enable smart contracts for Litecoin, here is a good read on how sidechains works:

2016-06-05 20:59:37;"Please Consider This For An Upcoming On-Chain Block Size Scaling Solution For Litecoin (""amended Bitpay Proposal"")";"9 hours and no comments, Is this any good then? It's several tiers above my mental pay grade unfortunately. I expect this could be an amazing development all the litecoin devs are working overnight to include this in the upcoming roadmap the air in litecoin HQ is a heady mix of coffee armpits and adrenalin this is the breakthrough to realise satoshis vision of visa size scaling, litecoin for the masses whooragh whooragh who....ragh............only me then.Too much to read on the phone but I'll read this at home, I'm no expert but will try to understand the proposal to see if questions/doubts spark more participation from others**TL;DR:**

The proposal consists of two parts, (a) and (b), as follows:

**(a) : The Bitpay Part:**

Each block of size S is considered a vote for block size limit (BSL) of 2\*S, and the votes are evaluated (and hence BSL updated) regularly every [12096] blocks by taking the median of all [12096] votes (may replace 12096 by 2016).

Here, the constant parameters ""2"" and ""12096"" are fixed constants of the new consensus rules and might be subject to debate and optimisation.

**(b) : The Amendment:**

For a block ""N"" of size greater than ""current_BSL/2"", only the TX fees of the first ""n"" transactions of block N are awarded to this block's miner, where ""n"" is the greatest integer that fulfills the condition

*""the cumulative size of the first n transactions is <= current_BSL/2""*.

The remaining TX fees are awarded to the miner of the future block ""N+1+H"", where H between {0..255} is the least significant byte of the block hash of block N.

Here, the constant parameter ""2"" is the same as the ""2"" in part (a) and has to be changed the same way as the ""2"" in (a) in case of parameter optimization. It is debatable whether the ""2"" in part (b) should be replaced by another value like 2.1 or 2.5 - this would also allow a miner to vote for a DEcrease of the current BSL without penalty on the mining rewards by forgoing tx fees."

I've never heard of Livewallet? Sometimes BTC-e deposits can get backlogged.

Contact their support email address (they're not too good at English so keep your vocab easy).



I always do:


> Coinbase -> Shapeshift.io -> Electrum

>    (BTC)   ->      (LTC)



I don't do much trading, but GDAX is adding Litecoin support (LTC/USD and LTC/BTC) very, very soon. GDAX is owned by Coinbase, for whom /u/coblee (creator of Litecoin) works for. If you want to do trading now, I would look at Bitfinex for now, but also BTCC (if you're interested in Chinese trading). BTCC is owned by Charlie's brother and pretty good.BTC-e are trustworthy, but as for LiveWallet, I'm trying to google them and I can't see a single result...

Going through Coinbase, then to BTC-e or ShapeShift.io is generally a good way. If you're looking for a normal exchange to do trading on, then BTC-e is your best bet, with Poloniex and Bitfinex possibly coming in second place.

If you want a trustworthy LTC wallet, use LiteVault.net (it's in the sidebar too, so you know it's legitimate)Coinbase > shapeshift > litecoin paper wallet > hodl. I use multiexplorer wallet. It has built in shapeshift.io support. You buy your BTC on coinbase, send it to your multiexplorer wallet. Then you click on the exchange button, select ""litecoin"", enter the amount, then sit back and watch the magic happen.Kraken works fine for me "
2016-06-12 21:38:44;Sigh. Funds off paper wallet?;"Android app is somewhat broken at the moment, in many ways.

Try importing the key into LiteVault.net - much more accurate (it's in the sidebar on this subreddit too).Probably, your Android wallet does not have access to the full history of unspent money on the private key you scanned. Then, it will only show the total of what it can see.

Your paper wallet does not have a balance. The balance is constructed from unspent money, sent to the address that corresponds to your wallet (these amounts are called ""unspent outputs""). If your Android app misses some unspent outputs, the ""balance"" will not reflect the true amount that can be spent with your private key.

2016-06-11 17:43:13;How do I test my PC's ability to mine litecoin?;"https://www.liteguardian.com/gettingStarted look therehi /u/goat_bacon

I've been out of the mining business for quite a while now, but more than happy to answer. 

As others have said, it will not work out well as far as what you could ""earn"" by mining. in simplistic terms, mining is like a lottery. And you are against every other person out there mining. Some are small time miners, some are large ones (to the tune of millions of dollars worth of equipment). When you mine, you are submitting a mathematical answer to a algorithm. Guess correctly and you win! One of the variables within that algorithm is the difficulty, which measures how much ""hash power"" the network (i.e. the blockchain) has applied to it. 

Back in the old days, people used CPUs to mine. And it was profitable! But humans are efficient creatures, and soon there after someone figured out how to mine Litecoin with GPUs, which are more powerful than CPUs. And right behind that, these things called ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) were made for Litecoin. These devices are the pinnacle of mining (short of quantum computing haha). 

So now ASICs are on the scene, which are hundreds of thousands more times powerful than CPUs. So at the end of the day, the difficulty is so high that the hash power you throw at the network is minuscule compared to everyone else. So low that you may earn less then a penny a day (im not crunching any numbers here, just throwing out educated guesses). The power that your CPU would consume would very much outweigh that penny. On top of that, your CPU was not designed for hardcore number crunching at all times, which would cause it to have a short lifespan.

Hope this helps!Please don't.

Also read before you write, you have lots to learn before you can enjoy your crypto experience.dont do it your comp wont be able to make a profit i guarentee itAs others have pointed out the cost in power isn't worth it any more. Also factor the wear and tear on ur hardware. Just skip coffee a day or two and buy some.I also strongly suggest you take a look at some of the educational videos the Litecoin Association produced, one of them on mining :)

2016-06-19 21:31:02;What is the average orphan rate of the litecoin network?;"Shorter block times *increase* orphan rates, all other things held constant.  Roughly speaking, the average orphan rate is given by

  orphan rate = 1 - e^-(t/T) 

which, for orphan rates less than ten percent or so can be approximated as

  orphan rate ~= t/T

where T is the mean block time and t is the average block propagation time to the network's hash power.

If the average propagation time for a block is 6 seconds, then (approximately speaking) Bitcoin would have a ~1% orphan rate, Litecoin would have a ~2.5% orphan rate and Dogecoin would have a ~10% orphan rate.  I solo mined in 2012-2013 and never saw anything near a 10.1% orphan rate. They were rare; but, always disappointing. Are you sure you're seeing that high a rate."
2016-06-19 20:10:57;Folks from /r/btc propose to test SegWit with Litecoin first;"Does litecoin even need it with the faster block times and non clogged up blocks?

It's already in testing on the Bitcoin Testnet  AFAIK so i don't see the point in testing it on a live and equally important network. 

We don't need to be a guinea pig and potentially be in a DAO type of situation. 

Nevertheless, It is nice to see Litecoin being mentioned in the Bitcoin community. Oh hell no, don't pawn off that clusterfuck of an idea on litecoin.  They are looking for a guinea pig.Not sure what the issue is, two week block confirmation is pretty much the industry standard.

/shameless first two week joke

I think the team will have something awesome in store. Let's just wait and see.If you want to test anything, the code is still right here:  https://github.com/steve-sokolowski/litecoin-bip101-4.

It's simple, puts litecoin well ahead of bitcoin, and doesn't require any complex and dangerous changes.I like how Litecoin can be the tester..... Not.  I think LTC compliments BTC well as coblee always imagined it to. This is the bold move that LTC provides BTC and why I as a miner, trader, and holder of multiple coins have always agreed with the notion that Charlie really is a passionate dev.Before I used to think Litecoin can wait as the blocks are far from being full, then Bitcoin would have been our testnet...

Now, this is a risky move, for sure. I'm sure I will not feel comfortable before, during and after the fork.

But there's something to gain from this : respect. For too long Litecoin have been described as a useless clone and we don't have a full time marketing team spamming other sub to ""sell"" Litecoin and explain them why it's needed.

It's time for everyone to see that Litecoin is great, have great devs and reinforce Bitcoin (not like eth and dao acting like know it all and tarnishing cryptos as a whole with their unprofessional attitude).
We should seek alliances like what happened with Doge. Help each other and win all together.

It's time to make a move, I'm all for it !Litecoin isn't some experimental test coin. This is why testnet exists. This thread and idea is idiotic and pointless. Looks like it's happening, but not as a test. https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4oujk3/segwit_should_be_tested_on_litecoin_first/d4fw9wthttp://imgur.com/0yFWLta !! X)I am not a programmer as 99% prolly can know here what update will work best is SigWit or whatever!

But we all see BTC is stuck at mud, it tries to give market all it wish like 1000 transaction in sec, if it manage (prolly it can not) but that move if successful will kill almost all altcoins one day!

LTC need to brand itself that it can offer to market! sure its bald move, but what anyone think 4x more then BTC is not eneough for market adoption, if BTC will be for large purchase we need to cover rest, and advencing development and branding to something need some risk taken!"

I cannot believe this bs any more.Ow look, another promise, thank god you guys learned from that ............... I'm starting to believe this entire thing was set up to make big stakeholders be able to slowly sell out a dying coin. In about 1 week from now BTC will have the groundwork done to create sidechains. Please explain me the need for any alt after that?Some context to this, if you follow me on twitter you can see every once in a while I've been providing somewhat of an update on the progression as best as possible. Multiple times I've mentioned ive spent all night on working on adding content or editing (generically speaking), of course, thats after working all day long at my day job.

The originally two weeks announcement was premature, and the scope and breadth of the road map has increased substantially. My purpose of these tweets and this post was to inform the community as best as possible that yes we are working on it, its just taking much longer than anticipated. For those who are disappointed in the length of time I can assure you that its not wasted. Also consider that the coordination involved with no less than 7-8 time zones makes it difficult to get things accomplished.

Because you're dealing with e-commerce, you need SSL (HTTPS). I noticed nowhere on your site uses SSL, not even the Login page. This puts users login details at risk, for example if they're on public (or just insecure) wifi, or using something like TOR, their username and password could be stolen.

If you set up your website behind [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) (FREE), you'll get SSL at no cost, with close to no set-up required. Alternatively, you can also get an SSL certificate for free from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Either of these options will help to protect your customers from having their information stolen, or having their payments intercepted by criminals.Good, looked for stuff for my dog, Winston ( greyhound, rescued).

I would humbly suggest that the next step is to prioritize the improvements noted. Also, and it's a really small, nitpicky thing, why in God's Holy Name are we calling them BIPs? BIP is short for *Bitcoin* Improvement Proposal. I do NOT advocate that we start calling them LIPs, but there needs to be a simple acronym that reflects the true origin of these improvements. Perhaps Lightcoin Advanced Module Proposals (LAMPs), which is easy to remember and plays off the Lightcoin name itself?OH, YES!!!Fantastish.Since the roadmap speaks about communicate forums, what about a slack channel?About SegWit, does following BIP141 mean it will be rolled-out as a soft fork? If yes, why did you decide not to roll it out as a HF? Unless my understanding is wrong, the HF option has some benefits over SF, the only hurdle would be making sure HF goes smooth. Thank you!

Is it possible to use Litecoin multisig with Litevault (in the future) ?
I use myself Multisig Copay (for Bitcoin of course) and it's a perfect and very secure solution...  
""Copay implements a multisig wallet using p2sh addresses. It supports multiple wallets, each with its own configuration, such as 3-of-5 (3 required signatures from 5 participant peers) or 2-of-3. To create a multisig wallet shared between multiple participants, Copay requires the extended public keys of all the wallet participants. Those public keys are then incorporated into the wallet configuration and combined to generate a payment address where funds can be sent into the wallet. Conversely, each participant manages their own private key and that private key is never transmitted anywhere.  

To unlock a payment and spend the wallet's funds, a quorum of participant signatures must be collected and assembled in the transaction. The funds cannot be spent without at least the minimum number of signatures required by the wallet configuration (2-of-3, 3-of-5, 6-of-6, etc.). Once a transaction proposal is created, the proposal is distributed among the wallet participants for each to sign the transaction locally. Finally, when the transaction is signed, the last signing participant will broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.""

In fact, it's very simple to use and I need to approve myself BTC transactions (windows desktop) using an other device (my Android phone with Copay installed)  _ 2-of-2

You'll spend more money on electricity powering it than you could hope to make.The short answer is probably no. I don't know how you come by electricity, but unless it's being paid for by someone else it costs more to power most rigs then you currently make in coin. I make litecoin by mining litecoin.Buy the coin you want and hold. Mining is fun and educational but is only profitable if you have very cheap power. Honestly no.  At least not Litecoin.

2016-08-07 08:33:00;Amid Blockchain Hype, Is There Still a Place for Litecoin?;"Nice article. I think Ltc will be still around in 10, 20 years. It's a solid coin (see history, many came and died).

There are good fundamentals: Intelligent people backing it (devs and the association), a community that doesn't censor dissenting opinions and big volumeAsics killed crypto miners and they alone had enough interest to spread the word.Litecoin is needed more than ever.

Litecoin has 3 times higher transaction capacity than bitcoin, and the bitcoin blockchain is full. 

There are 4 times more litecoin blocks in a given time frame, and each block has a maximum size of 750kb compared to bitcoins 1000kb.

This gives a capacity that corresponds to 3Mb bitcoin blocks.
Many anti-litecoiners think that a deceased Litecoin would somehow be a boon for the alt community it would not. I say a litecoin revival into 1 billion territory would ignite such a fire into the whole altcoin market the air would be a heady mix of singed bitcoin maximalist eyebrows and ether pant poop.

Instead Charles lee's litecoin profits likely went into his investment in btcchina. I recon coblee viewed himself as a Satoshi type character who would slip away and leave litecoin to support itself, the difference was Satoshi hasn't profited as of yet and litecoin couldn't stand on its own feet. Most litecoiners did what Charles hoped to do which was to walk away, many shifted to Dogecoin first then off to the next flavour of the day.he just needs to hardfork it and then we have Litecoin and Litecoin ClassicWe should get someone to spend an hour to fill in the forms partnering us with Microsoft Azure.

2016-08-14 16:11:29;Where is LTC regarding block size;"LTC can handle 4x the txts BTC can handle. Blocks are fine for a long time... would be nice though to be even more proactive than BTC in the event there is a black swan event in the traditional financial sector... Right now, there is NOT a problem with LTC. It's a fact. Have you even tried sending a bitcoin transaction?

I sent some coins via Shapeshift. It took 40 minutes for 1 confirmation on BTC. By which point my LTC transaction already had 15 confirmations.

I don't think premature optimisation is a good thing. The Litecoin network is underloaded, and ready to take so many transactions without breaking a sweat.No need for LTC to innovate with blocksize solutions, almost nobody uses it. They'll just copy whatever innovation was developed for bitcoin when it's needed.You can read the 2016 roadmap here:

https://litecoinassociation.org/data/roadmap.pdf

Litecoin currently is capable of 4 times as many transactions as Bitcoin is in a ten minute period. That said they are currently investigating development into the flexcap block size limit.

You'll get the response litecoin has 4X bigger blocks and hardly anyone uses it so litecoin needs to do... Nothing. The failure to grasp that huge numbers of Bitcoiners would have shifted over to litecoin if it had diverged from Bitcoin core's strategy. Instead they all tumbled into ethereum and well that story continues.    

Blockstream - Charles lee - btcchina - I fear there is some unhealthy alliance here. Decentralised currencies promised great things but in the end delivered us much of the same, small entities controlling the majority. Lol, its dead for a long time now. There are no plans to increase the litecoin blocksize in the near future then?"

Being that you already sent the LTC, they'll be stuck in the network for 3-4 days before you can get them back. After that you might need to rescan (google it).

If all else fails, you might be able to export your private keys and import them into Electrum or LiteVault (links in the sidebar, wallets)Make sure you've installed it correctly, here's our guide on that:

2016-08-21 14:57:57;Worth to buy?;"Everyone reading this sub-reddit is pro-Litecoin. You aren't going to get a very balanced response here.

On a broader note, it is a bad idea to invest in things that you don't understand. If you need strangers on the internet to tell you whether or not to invest, you probably should not invest.If you look around a little you'll find some people saying every cryptocurrency in existence is dead. In general for litecoin people saying so don't back it up with any evidence. It's been one of the top coins for years. Here are some reasons I like it:

- Capable of four times as many transactions as Bitcoin in a ten minute period. Frankly if payment processors had adopted Litecoin in the past year current Bitcoin block discussions would be irrelevant (and likely the price of both coins higher). Anyone who has watched these discussions understands the immediate advantage of a network with larger transactional capability.

- Faster confirmation times. The only people who don't think this is important have never spent a single coin or they have patience that the average person does not possess.

- The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks.

- Anti-spam.

- Fast well established network. Current Hashrate is 1,643 GH/s. Since scrypt is memory intensive it is known to be approximately 1000 times slower hardware wise in comparison to SHA256. Fair comparison to the Bitcoin network requires multiplying that hashrate by 1000 (1,643 TH/s). The fact is for most of Litecoins history the hashrate has been relatively high and secure. Those comparing it to the Bitcoin network without considering this 1k factor are either being disingenuous or just ignorant of the facts.

- Continuous development look here at number of releases in past year: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/releases 

- Upcoming new features and active development look here for whats happening in 2016: 
https://litecoinassociation.org/data/roadmap.pdf

- Longevity. Many coins have temporarily eclipsed litecoin as they were marketed for the purpose of increasing the fiat accounts of a small group and emptying the accounts of new users. Unfortunately this has been detrimental to crypto-space in general.

- Great community.

- Fully supported by GoCoin a growing merchant payment processor used by thousands of merchants https://www.gocoin.com/ as well as other processors such as coinpayments, Asmoney, Alfacoins and Coinify.

- Liquidity. You can sell thousands and not crash the market. Maintains value. Look at the chart here indicating volume in the last 24 hours relative to other coins. http://cryptocoincharts.info/coins/graphicalComparison In fact volume has remained high since last June while maintaining a stable price.

- The speed, liquidity and value of Litecoin is useful to traders seeking arbitrage opportunities between exchanges.

- Soon to be added to coinbase.

- Upcoming release to include a on-chain adaptive block size scaling solution. This will substantially increase the transactional capacity of Litecoin. 

- Fair release. In a crypto world of premined and ICO releases many appreciate this fact. The code was released well before the Genesis block was mined and everyone knew when it would be going live; therefore, individuals could anticipate and get their miners and software ready.

- It's primary function is to be a cryptocurrency.

- It will always maintain the integrity of the blockchain (no hard forks for special interests).

- Security.

Let's call a spade a spade, this project is dead.

Does anyone care about the number 6 crypto currency whose market cap is barely that of Dash?When litecoin is as widely used as bitcoin, the litecoin price will be much higher, which is good news. 

According to Metcalfe's Law:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3x8ba9/bitcoins_metcalfes_law_relationship_between/
There is no reason it should take that long time. 

Many technical solutions are already present and tested in bitcoin, and are easily ported to litecoin. 

User adaption might also be much quicker, since bitcoin has been used to learn about cryptocurrencies. For end users it is simple as changing the ""1"" in an address to an ""L"". 

And compianies that have invested time and money in bitcoin can easily start to accept litecoin as well.
Dump LTC and buy another coin. LTC/BTC heading back down to new lows again.

Even 2 exchanges that announced support soon are in no hurry to add it.The next big crypto will be one that takes anonymous transactions to the next level. It isnt Litecoin unfortunately since it is missing from the roadmap. 10 years? No 6 months and I am out."

If Litecoin withdrawal works, everyone buys litecoin to get most out of the exchange while they can, before its too late and they get nothing.

2016-09-25 15:21:18;2 A2 Terminator LTC Miner Help;"What you're going to want to do is this:

1. Make sure you have the latest ANX firmware installed onto your SD card. To do this, you're going to need to download the ANX image itself, which you can find here: (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1141802.0). Theres a link in the first post.

you're also going to need to download a program called Win32DiskImager (I assume you're using windows). This program allows you to write the ANX software onto your SD card.

2.After you have flashed ANX firmware onto your SD card, you are going to want to insert SD into terminator (obviously), and run the Ethernet cable from your terminator to your router. After everything is cabled up, power on your machine.

3. Now, we want to verify your terminator is getting an ip address leased through DHCP (this makes sure its getting internet access). To do this, log into your router's web based interface (more than likely 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1) try both of those addresses by literally typing the IP into a web browser like firefox. This should take you to your router's web based interface. Once there, youre going to have to search for something along the lines of DHCP client list, or host client list, something like that (because different brand routers have different user interfaces). Once there, give your DHCP a refresh. Now your terminators IP should show up and it should appear on the list.

4. Type your terminators IP into your web browser to access it's web based interface. Simply point it at your mining pool with proper worker name and password and wallah! you are now mining Litecoins. (oh and make sure your wallet address is set up on your pool's website so you get paid). Let me know if you run into any issues and ill try to help the best i can.What application are you using to mine?

This gets me more excited for the possibilities of Litecoin and its bright futureCan there be a move away from The term ""Core"" I believe this word has been perminantly tainted by ""Bitcoin core"" maybe ""hub"" or ""centre"" something that sounds more open and friendly rather than core - the stubborn gloomy impenetrable dungeon like developer abyss of no return where big ideas go to get scaled down over long peroids of time. 

 MAKE LITECOIN GREAT AGAIN Can we post detailed instructions for updating the core wallet? This should be done every time there is an update so people aren't worried about it or intimidated by the process. I don't think Litecoin should even consider Segwit until it's released and well tested. Litecoin doesn't need Segwit now, or even in the near future. There's better alternatives in the works such as Flexible Transactions, and what has been proven time after time; on-chain scaling. I know it's not quite an Apples to Apples comparison.  

Don't use layer 2 until it's necessary (it isn't right now.) Litecoin still has plenty of space for on-chain scaling.

Gotta have'm.  I am in 100%.I sent this to Xinxi a few days ago on the LitecoinTalk channel but got no feedback.

Hello Xinxi,
I think this is a great idea and I have also been pondering on doing this for a few years now. I have gone as far as engineering security features, design and name-brand. The number one reason I have not finished and released my prototypes is because of government restrictions. I live in South America and I have been selling Bitcoins (physical and electronic) on MercadoLibre (Latin version of EBay). Recently MercadoLibre has deleted all accounts selling Bitcoins and virtual currencies. Several Bitcoin exchange start-ups have basically been kicked out or shut down in my region. The last thing I want at this point in time is to attract the attention of the people in control.
The number two reason I have not released my prototypes is because of name-brand trust. Any entity that is anti-Bitcoin can invest a relatively small amount of money to sabotage your credibility by counterfeiting your name-brand and destroying trust with ""0"" value private keys. My intentions were to create a ""smart-phone"" app that can use NFT, or IR, or whatever fancy sensing capability to verify ""wallets"" right on the spot at the point of sale between two parties. However... we all know what the app-stores are doing to cryptocoin apps.
So... I am sort of standing by waiting for a little help in my region with this idea for something new to develop to counter these issues.

I'd love to hear any feedback from the community.

Thanks.I like this ideaHow about integrating some sort of multi-sig into it as well, so when the customer purchases the LTC, the shop keeper has to activate it and unlock the LTC, so if they all get robbed, it will still be safe because they are inactivate till the shop keeper activates them, just a thought, maybe I misunderstood it.

It is unfortunate that some of your Litecoin resources on Jaxx went down recently, but it is clearly not to your blame. Blockr.io recently went down due to their servers running out of space.

----------------------

I think the Litecoin community supports and congratulates your achievements with Jaxx, and we hope to enjoy your future support and investment into Litecoin. Thank you for all you are doing.It's amazing to see the level of dedication you (Anthony) and the team at Decentral / Jaxx are putting in the community. I think that even though the Jaxx wallet has had a few hiccups with various currencies so far, you've been transparent and have good customer service to improve on these problems consistently. I think it's noble Decentral is bridging the gap between the different blockchains and cryptocurrencies. 

Anthony, may I suggest one thing? Why not offer a paid wallet? Something just like 1-3 bucks in the app store which could help you supplement your revenue and hire more support and development. I think there aren't any real premium wallets out there and I think there should be as they are places we store our funds. Free options are great, but we can't rely on open source, unpaid features forever. There should be a premium option and I think the community and Decentral would benefit from that. Thank you for the Litecoin.

2016-10-14 16:46:56;PSA : jaxx for Litecoin is not working well at all;"It's not Jaxx's fault, it was Blockr (an API provider) (https://ltc.blockr.io). 

LiteVault has been experiencing similar issues because Blockr went down (which is ran by Coinbase), and had been down for almost 2 days, only came back online within the past few hours.We're still having issues with blockr.io. Working hard to get our new LTC nodes, api and relay system deployed over the weekend. We had decided to launch LTC on the back of blockr.io (which has been rock solid for us) and hopefully deploy our new infrastructure before blockr.io became a problem. Unfortunately, the timing of blockr's downtime happened a fews before the planned launch of our new backend.

Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing. We hate being down. This is the very reason we are not just carrying tokens such as litecoin, but also creating the full infrastructure and redundancy systems for tokens we carry to ensure this doesn't happen in the future. For now we rely on blockr, soon we'll add our own multiple nodes and relay system, and further down users will be able to even run their own nodes. [blockr.io](http://ltc.blockr.io/) is borked again, so no new LTC transactions showing up in Jaxx.

blockr.io reports the [last block was at 2016-10-14 22:45:05](http://ltc.blockr.io/block/info/1079566) (12 hours ago at time of writing).

Jaxx must surely be wondering if they can really rely on blockr.io at this point. Seems like a classic case of [Error 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_33). The success of LTC on Jaxx rests completely on blockr.io.The Litecoin issue is due to blockr.io being down. The ETC issue due to the attacks happening on the Ethereum network. Although the transactions are showing confirmed on the network, it's playing havoc with the services the industry uses to show balances and push transactions.Glad to hear your funds are safe.  Hopefully a patch will come out soon and fix this issue.  Jaxx looks like a nice wallet and I was looking forward to trying it out.I prefer Coinomi vs Jaxx, only advantage of Jaxx is the ETC and the DAO wallet that are not on Coinomi. Beside that I don't know which one of these 2 is the most secure for multi coin.

In addition, does some of you know how safe is such wallet? Is there a malicious software on my phone that can get access to my private key or my recovery list of words? Is it more safe or less than a Linux client?>*edit. My funds are safe though, I took the private key from jaxx, imported it to Litecoin electrum, works fine. 

Does litecoin electrum support bip39?

Or does Jaxx use the Electrum seed method?"

Keep buying!!! Forget about the ""reality"". People are always stupid, too stupid they can't see all the development, the promise, the potential, the beauty of litecoin. It's just stupid China people think yuan will continue depreciating and they need to flee away from their country, so they buy Bitcoin for capital escape. If such emotional reaction would cause people to have even a little doubt, then they shouldn't hold litecoin. Lowest ratio? So what, Lets keep buying!!!Look at LTC/CNY http://i.imgur.com/U84oNch.png

I'm not a trader at all, just an enthousiast, i putted all that i can afford to loose into crypto. It was excactly 2btc at that time.
I get in litecoin when it was 0.013 BTC worth.
Now i'm fucked, if i want BTC back i got only 1.17 BTC.
Sure, if we speak about cash, price went up.
I know, i know, those are the risks involved, but due to the lack of ltc support and rumours about it, i'm becoming less and less confident.
And it's not some lines of code or full of promises papers that will bring back hope.

- I will let everyone here know how it goes.   
First impression is this is probably okay, maybe some things to be aware of.   
-------------------------------------
The claim that it is an Litecoin card
> LTC debit card is a card that links directly to your LITECOIN and keeps your money protected.   
   
 is apparently a concept that did not get translated correctly.    
It is a debit card, at this moment it seems to be a USD or EUR or GBP debit card,   
 but it is not correct to advertise it as an LTC debit card because it is not actually holding LTC.   
I hope that the UQUID folks either implement it correctly as a true LTC debit card,    
or correct the semantics in their advertisment to match the reality.   
Just to clarify something up front - there is no Litecoin account,    
 you can buy into this with LTC (very fast, seems to work quite well, so far)    
 but the way their system works is you choose a FIAT to hold funds in    
 and you replenish that account with a transaction that cashes your LTC
into being the FIAT.   
Repeating: you send LTC - it gets converted to BTC   
which then pays for whichever FIAT you declare the funds to be held in.   
It is a one-way transaction for LTC,    
 unlike something like Bitwala where you can    
 simply turn your BTC around and send it back home if you need.   
I say one-way but there appears to be a provision for sending it back    
 to your bank account if you choose (certainly not on my to-do list, either).   
I really do wish UQUID held the LTC (or whatever - they accept others also)    
**HODLing FIAT** is a phrase that stains the air with a certain odor,    
 but I suppose they have some constraints they work against,    
 and as long as we can simply reload 'when necessary' then it all work out.    
is this like the litecoin version of bitpay? or is it like the shift card?What happens when the balance on the card is zero, is there still a fee per month?

Some other crypto currency debit cards have no fee when the card is empty.

If there is zero balance for three months, and then money is deposited, what happens?

2016-10-29 20:57:26;What's up with these latest troll/panic posts anyway? someone scared of litecoin?;"When trolls appear on this subreddit, that's a bullish indicator.Litecoin doesnt serve the big players well.  Take Ethereum for example; nobody who cares about the fundamentals of cryptocurrency gives a shit about smart contracts, yet ethereum was blown up to be the biggest thing since sliced bread - bigger than bitcoin even.  It is centralized and the majority of the supply is held by a few people.  Breakups are hard on people. 

Some of these people have been in an abusive LTC relationship for years and lost a lot. Then they come here to vent. 

Litecoiners are scared because of the all time low ratios. Its quite a rational panic, I think. The question is will it bounce? I dunno but it's fucking annoying and im banning these fags.Here's the thing. 

Bitcoin mining is largely centralized in China where a cartel of miners work in conjunction  with a few American and European investors who got rich selling BTC at 1200usd in end 2013. 

Since then they've had time to organize and commit resource to funding a PR and propaganda campaign to promote Bitcoin dominance and incentive profit from continued mining. 

Part of that propaganda campaign involves perpetuating myths, fear and uncertainty  about other coins. It may be done through  articles in mainstream publications,  articles in publications hosted by those parties,  paying or incentivising journalists,  trolls and shills to spread their message in some way. 

This sort of propaganda can be self perpetuating as asserting dominance is a psychologically satisfying consolidation  of perceived  power. 

In any case numerous lies and misinformation about other alts that could threaten Bitcoin dominance are spreading this way which is actually very damaging for the market as a whole. 

Day trading is the major price driver above and beyond intrinsic value and this is largely driven by sentiment and value proposition + delivery of value proposition. 

Litecoin's value proposition isn't that great to me compared to others (ETH, SDC,  Waves, GNT, DGD, DASH) but clearly it has a sustained value which should always be viewed as a reassuring sign.

As is the case with such aggressive business models, the first thing to suffer is the content. Too often it is hard to find good content without first having to wade through masses of poorly-researched and badly-written space-filler and marketing hype.

With the advent of Bitcoin one of the many areas touted as ripe for disruption is the business of online publishing. The idea is thatÂ micropayments will be able to provide revenue for publishers and content creators, in the place of intrusive advertising. So why are so many crypto-news outlets following the outdated advertising model?

Reddheads.com is ad-free and always will be. Graphics and links for banner areas on the website are chosen by virtue of their informative value. The website will never enter into any third-party advertising contracts or generate pay-per-click advertising revenue.

Today users can tip articles with Reddcoin, and further micropayment channels will be considered to support the business. As the website develops opportunities for sponsorship may be forthcoming, but the user-experience will never be compromised: in this case a dedicated sponsors page (which a user will only be able to access and view by specificallyÂ choosingÂ to do so) could be envisaged.
The goal is to build a 21st-century online publisher that is totally focussed on quality content and user experience.

**Call for submissions**

To succeed Reddheads aims to engage with writers from anywhere in the world. As a cryptocurrency news website the media outlet welcomes submissions on any subject related to any particular cryptocurrency / blockchain project or more generally to all cryptocurrencies. Reddheads.com also welcomes submissions from members of crypto projects who wish to get information about their projects to a wide audience. 

Anyone interested in submitting writing for publication is invited first to make contact using the form on the website (https://www.reddheads.com/en/contact/) or via PM in order to receive a list of requirements for submissions.Ugh reddcoin, such a failure ipo coin where all the existing users think they will be rich because they have 100 million reddcoin.

  Hi all,

Can someone clarify - has segwit been merged into 0.13-dev?

If it hasn't been yet, it might be worth holding off on it a little (at least until things start to look more positive for bitcoin in that respect).  It would be unfortunate if litecoin commited to segwit only for bitcoin to subsequently fail with it.

(I don't have strong pro- or anti-segwit feelings by the way, I _am_ pro-litecoin though, would hate to see it hurt by this)It's good that litecoin hasn't employed the segwit yet or won't start it at all. Once the market realizes it's over engineering for bitcoin's segwit, people will panickedly buy litcoin for safety. And we will see LTC/btc ratio raising because litecoin is more conservative and secure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW--IGAfeasOmg. Read carefully the last dev update. Segwit will not be for at least another year. Also 0.13 will not include any innovation, so it is unlikely LTC 0.13 will be attractive for investors. Chinaes LTC forum is dead, nobody cares in China about LTC. So LTCBTC ratio will continue to fail."

However, according to available information, the party of the new chips are very small, as there is no major investment. So, I dont think that difficult will increase more higher. Imo, Maximum for it is 75,000.My limit for difficulty is 100K. At that point I break even only with electrical costs. Winter is coming and since the ASICs heat my house I'll be able to tolerate as high as 130k until late March.

Since it's to the advantage of the manufacturer to report this as a small batch (encourages sales cause the inexperienced won't expect difficulty to climb in a major way ) the upcoming difficulty is unknown.Thanks for clarifying. I must admit that it is surprising for me that someone actually manufactured new generation of scrypt ASIC.

2016-12-03 16:11:40;I'm a big fan of LTC but the wealth distribution is a little Fucked;"You're only comparing it to BTC. If you compare to a multitude of other ALT coins there is not that much unusual about LTC. Additionally LTC is traded on a lot more exchanges than other coins and the top addresses represent exchange wallets. Those exchange wallets represent holdings of many members of the exchange.

As such determining distribution by wallets doesn't represent an accurate indication of who is holding.What you fail to realize is that the 100 richest list on BTC is misleading. The wealth of the early miners has been split across many wallets instead of holding all of it in one wallet like you see some doing in the 100 richest for LTC, so keep that in mind. The distribution of currency by address tells you very little. It has very little relationship to wealth per person. Comparing to BTC also tells you very little. My guess is that the distribution of LTC is concentrated in fewer addresses is because there are fewer addresses to begin with and most people hold their LTC on exchanges.This is terribly inaccurate because of exchanges and gambling sites.â¦and who's fault is that?"

2016-12-02 20:14:25;Why is LTC having Such a Hard time keeping up with bTC;"Finally a post on this. I was waiting because WTF.

Well, LTC/USD starting going back up but for a while there BTC/USD was going up and LTC/USD was going down.

But still LTC/USD hasn't broken the high that was set end of last month. 

Seems like someone is unloading LTC. Maybe China is mining LTC for cheap and dumping on the few buyers for USD.

LTC/BTC way down and about to break 0.005

ETH/BTC going down. LTC/BTC going down. XMR is down but isn't tanking like the other 2. 

Maybe LTC will pump long after BTC does. Unless China completely gave up on it as they are our last hope.

But I have a feeling some other coins will be much more profitable than LTC. Unless LTC has something in the works we don't know about that will make people come to LTC.

Remember LTC was only pumped because it was one of the very few alt coins back in the day. Then it pumped for the halving. That's it. I don't see a reason for LTC to go up again as the first 2 times it pumped it was just dumb money. And we are out of dumb money.Metcalfe's law explains it all.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3x8ba9/bitcoins_metcalfes_law_relationship_between/

There is a strong correlation between use of a crypto currency and the price.

Make you friends and relatives use litecoin and the price will rise.

The question is: How big is the incentive to use something else than Bitcoin?

Right now, the block limit, the number of transactions per second etc. do not incentivised people enough to use other coin.LTC is a 1st gen copy/paste coin that offers no features above and beyond what BTC (or any other copy/paste coin) offers.  Why should it be valuable?BTC was there first and became way more popular. In addition to that, BTC is more and more usable in certain places like bars, online shops etc. It's also much easier to buy for an average Joe. There are solutions that make it as easy to use as any regular debit card. LTC is pretty much useless in real world. Apart from some enthusiasts, no one cares about technical aspects like LTC transactions being a little faster to confirm.While LTC can be considered a faster and better coin than BTC for the most part it is a clone. The developers haven't differentiated enough to make people to buy it. Eth, XMR and several other alts offer slightly different things than BTC which gives them value compared to LTC. LTC offers...a slightly faster speed and more tps per second but that's about it. The devs really need to take risks and innovate on the LTC blockchain. They should have more freedom too. Unfortunately I haven't seen coblee take risks nor any of the other devs.  

As of right now it's look like a very dull silver to BTC's ""gold"" image if anything.so the general consensus on this would be that LTC can only rise when BTC goes through the roof? Watching the chart BTC has constantly risen however LTC stayed fairly constant?In my humble opinion, China farms are mining with close to free electricity and even the lowest LTC prices are profitable for them to dump at. That's IMO the main reason. Then you can wonder about BTC, USD, whatever. But the reason is China dumps like crazy. "

However,  if you just want to say, I mined litecoin it may pose an easy way for someone that has no idea to say they have done it.  Looking at the screenshots it has a nice looking UI.   Does it try to find a block solo mining or does it automatically mine in a pool?Smells like a scam to me.  *** Beware ***

*Any* person that knows how to code a GUI Litecoin miner for Windows or Android know really well that it is totally pointless to mine on a desktop - or even on a phone!?!! - and that you wouldn't gain more than a few fractions of a cent after mining the entire year on your phone, or perhaps a few cents on your desktop.


So if the developer won't gain anything through mining, and on top of it he even spent the time to make a nice-looking website to distribute his software, how could he then gain something?  Well, malware is the obvious answer!


Also note that OP is redditor for 24 days.  Sounds all safe to me!  /s
I really had to laugh at the description at the google store:

Totally free, just donates one in ten shares to developer.

Disclaimer:

Mining is a very intense task that puts strain on your CPU and will make your device get very hot. The developer is not liable for any effect this app has on your device in any way.

In other words will destroy your phone and we want 10 percent for helping you to do that.I scanned the Windows binary on virustotal.com.

In my opinion some scanners detect a virus because the application mines Litecoin, which some anti-virus are designed to detect. However, this does not necessarily mean that the app does not also do something else... please use at your own risk!


------------------------------


It would be nice if someone with a network analysis tool could run this on a VM to see incoming and outgoing connections from this app.Mining anything on an Android is not only worthless, but will probably murder your battery and even cause overheating.

Mining anything worthwhile with a standard desktop GPU died 4 years ago, and also tends to make your PC unusable while it mines. If it is a laptop, see what I wrote above about Androids because its the same thing. Assuming this isn't just an outright scam, it's not a good idea. 

Also, ""Analysts predict Litecoin could gain ground in 2017, possibly rising to $10"" - forexnewsnow.com"", is for one thing, total bullshit prediction by no one, and the whole site looks like a thinly veiled ad with an autoscraper for a news feed, not a real news site anyone knows or respects. Very scammy. 

I'd advise the lot of you to stay the hell away from this. If you really want to learn about mining, hit up the Litecoin forums for the real deal. 



Adding an FAQ to the windows app soon, initial thoughts on topics to cover are:

- How to register to the pool
- How to get worker info and use it to mine
- What the ""threads"" input means and how it works
- How to minimize the app to the system tray (Close window)
- How the usage fee works

It should be something like this:

* run this command in terminal:


    ./litecoind backupwallet ~/wallet.dat


If that doesn't work, just remove the wallet.dat part and keep the ~/
You should have a backup wallet now in your home directory.

Now download the latest version of Litecoin 0.10.4 from https://litecoin.org or https://litecoin.com.


* cd into that folder and start litecoin by doing this ./litecoind in terminal

2016-12-25 14:41:54;Heres why LITECOIN could be worth several hundred dollars each...;"when btc went to 1200 litecoin also went crazy.  I actually sold some for around 55 dollars each, but admittedly that was above market because the demand was so high and american buyers couldn't figure out how to get it at market (around 51ish i think) 

  I dunno about 100 dollars a coin but i could see it really picking up if bitcoin demand goes ballistic.  People who can't afford to buy an entire bitcoin will look to litecoins.  I think there is something psychological about having whole numbers.   > There is no fucking way Bitcoin is going to be able to handle all those transactions.

â¦

> Litecoin is an easy transition. It's been around for almost as long and with SegWit, it has a significantly higher throughput. Especially when you factor in lightning network...

Unless you don't think Bitcoin will get Segwit, you have to grant those same prospects to Bitcoin as well. With Segwit follows Schnorr and MAST which both improve throughput *and* privacy, and Lightning Network, which is basically unbounded throughput.

What Litecoin has over Bitcoin is four times as many on-chain transactions. That's nice, but it's just a relatively small constant factor, and one which will see lower relevance with new technologies.

Bitcoin fees have tripled this year, but has this lead to higher transaction volumes on Litecoin? I don't think so.

So the question is still as it always is - is there room for ""silver""? I'm not convinced, but I think there's a certain chance, and that's why I'm a long-term Litecoin holder.I think $8-$20 might be possible in the short term. just basing it off past performance in relation to btc. either that or back down to like $3. agree - LTC will prevail. 40 bucks is within reach in my option over some time[deleted]All it takes is a Jim Rickards like scenario to play out where everyone gets locked out of their bank accounts and people will learn.  Check out some of his work if you haven't already.  

He calls it ICE-9... Everyone is locked into these digital prisons.  All it takes is 1 keystroke to lock down the system... What good is money if you can't access it?

I see no reason why BTC can't take 5trillion LTC 1 trillion in the next 20 years.  1. Why do you think litecoin will be used for everyday transactions? I personally don't think there is a truly proven method to use decentralised systems to process quick point of sale type transactions reliably and cheaply. It seems like litecoin is too similar to bitcoin with SOME added benefits but nothing drastic enough to cause a shift or widespread adoption. 

2. Why don't ring signatures scale? 

My current view is that BTC will grow still but long term, Monero seems like the best option. True anonymity will drive demand over all else. Best part about Litecoin - Roger Ver isn't here to ""fix"" it yet...Jesus, you people are delusional. Why don't you just swap your LTC for BTC then? It clearly has more upside. The cost per transaction issue will be mitigated too by the lightning network. I see why people might have jumped to the no2 last BTC bubble... but LTC is no longer the second most talked about.

No doubt this should happen and more than these.  Why not lead the race to integrating strong privacy features.This post is far more interesting than all the ""roadmap"" stuff we used to anticipate so eagerly. It shows a project lead who is alertly up to date and technically qualified, sees the big picture and thinks long term about this project.

Litecoin development has been slow, and so the price development has been slow, but now there's reason to be quite bullish.

It's too bad to see how anti-Segwit many people here seem to be. The fixes Segwit brings are absolutely necessary for the next steps.With all due respect...   
""But some people say LN on Bitcoin will kill any reason to use Litecoin. *If people can do instantaneous transactions on Bitcoin, why would they use Litecoin?*""   
Well,      
Litecoin's appeal or point of interest is not limited to it having a faster confirmation time.  IMHO, the biggest appeal of Litecoin at the moment, is the fact that it is not Bitcoin.    
...
Some additional strengths to Litecoin:    
It has a fairly large distribution, (it's not some fly-by-night,flash-in-the-pan altcoin).   
It has a fairly extensive miner base.    
It is similar enough to bitcoin that if some disaster happens to bitcoin, only relatively minor adjustments need be made to the far more ubiquitous (relatively) Bitcoin infrastructure in order for Litecoin to step in and save the day.   
â¦   
I think it is premature and somewhat irresponsible to risk this valuable asset (the Litecoin system as it exists today) in order to implement a contentious and unproven technology such as Segwit. There are good reasons for the resistance being shown towards implementing these rather drastic changes to Bitcoin.  Why not just implement the Interledger Protocol?"

2017-01-15 05:09:38;I have $300 to start mining litecoin...Any advice on if I could start or is it impossible now?;"You're better off just buying coins Agree with the other posters just buy coins unless you don't mind not making a profit and just enjoy the process, here's my background on why not to mine with only $300.  GPUs will not earn a dime.  If I was to mine with my 290 today I'd pay 48 cents in electricity and only earn 2 cents in Litecoin.  
I stopped mining in May2014 when GPUs were still the main way to mine, I bowed out as ASIC miners came online (took the fun out of it for me).  My budget was $2000 with the commitment to sell the cards once they were no longer profitable (but keep one for my gaming rig :).  I ended up breaking even after ~5 months with the 280 and 290 radeon cards, and by that time the difficulty had far exceeded the ability of cards to profit on a per kWh basis.  I had to shut down or spend more chasing the increasing difficulty with ASIC miners.  I had 2x Radeon 290X, 2x 290, and 2x 280 running mining operations.  I mined in winter, paid only $0.10 per kWh, and used the mining as a primary heating source for my house near Seattle, so reasoned my real electric rate was closer to $0.08 kWh. My lessons learned:  
-Used equipment price is not adjusted for the future difficulty.  There are too many people who plug in the current hash rate and difficulty into a simple calculator and believe they can make a profit.  You will likely lose 30% on used equipment (at lest I did with BITCOIN miners)  
-If you bought a modern ASIC miner TODAY, you may make a profit this month compared to electricity expenses, but likely will have severely tapering profits and never make your investment back, unless you have free electricity.  Expect profits to dry up in a matter of months due to actual corporate miners with millions to spend on the latest equipment.  
-If you have free electricity, no reason not try! If I was back in college dorms with included electricity this would still be a 24/7 GPU operation for me with an ASIC or two, but of course if you use a GPU it puts a lot of stress on it and may shorten its lifespan.  
-Bottom line, if you're just looking to get litecoin, just buy them.  If you want to have fun mining, consider it like gambling in vegas.  Spend the $300, enjoy the process, and if you make any of it back, great, but plan on losing it for the process of enjoyment.Time machines cost more than $300.You are, uh, like a few years late on the mining train. It's basically impossible for you to profit from this unless you have a gpu farmDo your research before you put money into anything. No offense but you don't know much and you'll probably just end up losing all that money.Mine as a hobby...not to make money.The difficulty climb is very fast, so for $ 300 I think it's not a good idea to get into it. Both in the SHA and in the SCRYPT. Can be in the ETHA ..?in this time you better to spend you $300 in buying ltc not minning Buy a gtx 1070 and mine other coins with itWhere would you guys recommend buying coins?"
2017-01-14 16:36:44;Event/Analysis related to last surge?;"you call this a surge? top kek I must saynot much serious contribution so far. I am a TA trader, though combined with fundamental knowledge, I believe price action drive markets. However I did analyze the 2013 bubble indepth and I believe the most important factor is the ratio LTC/BTC. Ratio is usually dropping cause BTC is king and benefits from the network effect as being the first mover in this market. What happened in 2013 is that the ratio broke through its longterm daily trendline, then starting to build way stronger bull bars than bear bars. From a price action perspective, breaking the longterm trendline is a first indication of a potential trend reversal. Stronger bull bars vs weaker bear bars is a second indication. What is actually needed to declare it an upward trend is a higher high, higher low, then the confirmation with another higher high, which happened around 2013/11/18 - 2013/11/25 at a price 0.013-0.015. The confirmation (higher high after higher low) happened on 2013/11/26. If you entered here at around 0.016 you could have taken profits two days later at 0.05. Referring to BTC-e chart data btw. 

What I am saying is this: As soon as the ratio turns into a bull trend, I'd be quick to enter cause things go quickly, especially with such an empty sell side orderbook we have now. 

Essentially we are exactly at the same stage as in 2013. We already broke the longterm daily trendline, we started to build stronger bull bars than bear bars, currently retesting the trendline from above. We did have a higher high already at 2017/01/10, now trying to build a higher low, which could be an early entry. Considering that LTC has barley moved at all during BTC's recent rallies, it has a lot to catch up. Hashrate is at an all time high, going through the roof. In addition to that Segwit may activate on LTC before BTC which would give LTC a prime advantage and fundamental reason to pump. I believe we are close to a strong rally. If we break the longterm trendline connecting the two recent highest points 0.05 and 0.03, ratio could even leave this zone and pump way higher than 0.05. 

There is a lot of positive stuff for LTC out there right now. What is especially noticeable is the majority of traders being very bearish about LTC, declaring it as ""so dead"" again and again. This is when things get serious, the majority is seldom right on these kind of things. However this is trading, and this is crypto. Anything can happen any time, so beware and trade carefully.

2017-01-28 22:01:55;Here comes Monero..;"Disclosure: I am a long term Monero supporter that has recently become interested in Litecoin

I only speak for myself but can identify a number of reasons why Monero users might be interested in using Litecoin and collaborating on future development. I think the XMR and LTC communities can accomplish more by working together that competing directly:

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/823696817690816514

https://twitter.com/EncryptionGirl/status/825125429384200193

Monero users are not becoming interested in LTC recently solely because of its desire for improving privacy. Largely we are interested in LTC because of SegWit and the Lightning type networks it will help enable. LTC solving transaction malleability before BTC (with SegWit) is a huge advantage. The Monero community has a large number of former ""BTC maximalists"" that grew frustrated by the continued scaling debate and became aware of [dynamic block sizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM2ra-LzMQk&feature=youtu.be). The longer Bitcoin stagnates and Litecoin moves forward, the more likely some of those former BTC maximalists now involved with Monero will start taking a closer look at Litecoin as a viable alternative currency and store of value without the more immediate scaling concerns plaguing Bitcoin today.

>>but I don't know if the zerocoin protocol is the way to go because of the way litecoin is already coded.

As u/coblee mentioned on Twitter Confidential Transactions will be looked at by LTC after SegwWit. Since Monero [RingCT](http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/34) is based on [CT](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt) I feel confident in saying it is much better suited for LTC than zkSNARKs. Specific issues such as [transaction generation time and resource requirements](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/1112/monero-ram-requirements-compared-with-zcash) make CT a much better fit for any coin named Litecoin than zkSNARKs. Greg Maxwell designed CT for Bitcoin and it will also be much easier for LTC to implement, than the zerocoin protocol alternative you suggest.

If LTC is successful in implementing SegWit before BTC, thereby solving transaction malleability and easing future development there will surely be more Monero users that take a look at [LTC as a store of value](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/825138178591821825). I will help raise awareness of LTC myself within the XMR community and hope that developers on both sides can work together in the future.Confidential transactions are currently being researched and studied by litecoin devs including coblee. Pretty sure there are future plans to implement confidential transactions into litecoin but I don't know if the zerocoin protocol is the way to go because of the way litecoin is already coded.

https://m.soundcloud.com/whalepool/open-discussion-with-charlie-lee-on-litecoin-altcoins-bitcoin-and-more 

At 9:40 confidential transactions are talked about. I would honestly listen to the whole thing if you haven't already it's very informative and only like a month old.

Do you mean zcash? I know that Ethereum DEVs are planning to add pre-compiles of zk-snarks to Ethereum for metropolis -- maybe they could be added to litecoin as well?

But I think litecoin plays a huge role if it manages to implement segregated witness and lightning network first (before Bitcoin), sometimes people disparage litecoin and state it would only be a test case for Bitcoin which is somewhat true in that all the hackers would be trying to hack it, but people also reward people who try things first, and if litecoin pulls off segregated witness I think the rewards will be large..."

Yet the hash rate recently double. A big thanks to 1 big solo miner. 

BBANDS on LTC/USD show the lack of movement by how tight they currently are. http://i.imgur.com/5VWxUK0.png

$4.60 and $2.80 are the break out points for monthly BBANDS. 

Of course price is currently in the middle. So it's 50/50 chance this shoots up or down.


If for some reason BTC dumps then LTC dumps. 

If some LTC whales start pumping then you'll want to be in.

People think Segwit addition will pump LTC price. Which it may. But will people come to a coin that is hitting lows not seen in 4 years on LTC/BTC.

Only reason LTC has pumped was back in the day when LTC was the only other cool coin around. Then the halving / ponzi scheme pump. 

If you buy then you're banking on some whales pumping because Segwit is about to hit 75% which activates Segwit. But if you buy and BTC and LTC dumps due to China problems then you hold a heavy bag with everyone else that bought in the last 4 years.I think so, the community hasn't gone anywhere. The dev team, is coming back with a vengeance - creative highs/lows is something I ,myself completely understand.  I have this a lot personally.  

The reasons I love this coin - it was and is the fairest of them all, the idea that it seeks to be the other ( not overthrow or be something completely different ), and the folks here I understand.  Buy now, prices just dropped cause of China's regulationsThanks for the responses guysHow about mining?Sure!
Its best time to buy now."
2017-02-19 14:49:57;"Litecoin Creator: ""I Think There's a General Confusion that SegWit Signaling is a Vote.""";"Haha, this is so bad. Miners should still care about their bottom line. You can't convince them not to. 

The reality is that soft/hardforks simply have a cost, a risk (which is also cost) and certain (potential) benefits. Some have low cost/risk and large benefits. Others are high risk, low reward. 

Like with the DAO, SegWit could contain a zero-day vulnerability which someone could exploit. To either spend other people's coin, or grind the network to a halt. And because a roll-back would be disastrous a miner should think twice whether he wants to really risk shitting where he eats. 

Not to mention SegWit is a usability nightmare if not everyone is ready for it. So how is wallet support? Can all wallets recieve and validate SegWit transactions yet? Because even for Bitcoin this isn't even the case. 

So, people think miners can activate a soft-fork before everyone upgraded. But with SegWit that is definitely not the case, and not advisable. 

Like with a HF, I would strongly advice everyone to upgrade, be ready for SegWit transactions, and if the entire economy says YES, then miners would see a lower risk. And even then they have to check and double check everything beforehand. 

Sounds like blockstream core all over again...segwit is shit and that's why miners aren't signaling.  

You do not, I repeat, you do not need Segwit fo LN. LTC does not need LN at this time, or any point in the near future. Don't let them force a shitty upgrade down your throats."

In fact the all time high was late 2013 3.5 years ago. If a market technician drew channel lines adjusted for coin inflation it would clearly be a DESCENDING channel. I'm not sure where you see the price stagnating in the last half year. Look at a longer chart so you can see reality not a ""glass is half full"" view. In stark contrast please look at the Dash chart 2years ago $2 last year $4 today $20. with a logrithmic up sloping curve. SegWit looks like a dead hope to me, I'm sorry to say, and even so there is no assurance the market will see it as a strong feature. Hold if you like but for me it only is in order to attach myself to the hope of the past and preclude me from taking advantage of other more compelling opportunities.

We have a good opportunity with Segwit, however we are all waiting for one pool to signal... Think about it, why the fuck is the destiny of a coin in the hands of one mining pool? I look at other coins and I see active subreddits/forums and more importantly teams of developers working on new features, until Litecoin gets some funding from mining percentages or some other means this is going to continue. Note,  this is not a criticism of the team behind the coin, if anything it's praise for what they do for nothing.Uhh, it can break out at any time FYI.I wouldn't be surprised. By then BTC should have exploded. Then the alts start going up as BTC go sideways near the top. 

I see LTC/BTC started off the new weekly candle with a new low. Seems whales will scoop up cheap LTC on the LTC/BTC market as BTC goes up. Probably watch LTC bounce like 0.002 to 0.01 if Segwit activates if there is still dumb money left. All the smart money is going elsewhere.

2017-03-05 03:29:29;Opinions on FlexTrans for Litecoin? Haven't seen it discussed...!;"I haven't said too much about FlexTrans because, honestly, it just seemed like a dumb proposal. It seems like it's designed by someone who doesn't understand what the transaction format is used for.

Transaction format is only used to get the transaction hash (txid) and for calculating the block size. So for the latter use case, compacting the size of this format with a hardfork is silly. Because you can just increase the block size limit with a hardfork instead. It is actually quite dumb. 

For the former, you want a fixed format to calculate the hash. Having a variable format serves no purpose and might introduce other new maleability that is hard to spot. You want something that is simple and clear. There is absolutely zero need for flexibility in this format. Flexibility just introduces likelihood of bugs, which there were quite a few in the initial implementation.

Adding extension fields is really not needed. In the 8 years of Bitcoin's existence, there hasn't been any need to extend the transaction format. There is likely no reason to ever. The only possible addition is version bits, which the current format can handle. So having extension fields just lets people add extra useless data that will bloat the blockchain.

Lastly, the reason why FlexTrans is pushed is because it just sounds good. Why not have a flexible format and be future-proof?! Use XML... everyone uses XML! There is absolutely no technical benefits. So it becomes just a political feature to differentiate Bitcoin Classic/Unlimited from Bitcoin Core. Looks good, but... Who's crazy enough to want to hard fork?With the caveat that my programming know-how is quite limited; it would seem that this proposed upgrade contains many of the same improvements that SegWit proposes to improve.  Perhaps this could be a way to gain the benefit of an upgrade without the unnecessary drama and/or stigma attached to SegWit?  Stfu trollSomeone posted this thread to me; If people are interested, please note that the original documentation is here; https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/Flexible%20Transactions.html

The comments by /u/coblee gives me the impression he can benefit from a read-though of the documentation. To correct two points of his, about XML and extension fields. Neither are part of FT.

But as times goes by, it becomes more and more obvious that that's not going to happen. Perhaps his contact at f2pool changed his mind or wasn't honest with coblee at the first place.

Too bad, I think having Litecoin activate SegWit first would be a great experiment. It could pave the road for later adoption in Bitcoin.

As for why this is happening... I think the miners are not stupid. As great as SegWit is for all crypto, it takes away some power from miners and miners don't like that. We could all agree miners should have less power, especially considering mining centralization. However, miners don't agree.It's politics dude.  Politics.

As Bitcoin's ""little brother"", it's become caught in Bitcoin's family dispute.

Unfortunately, this also highlights a flaw in the game theory underpinning proof-of-work currencies:

* In theory, miners will act as individuals, competing with one another, resulting in the optimal service for users;

* In reality, they have chosen to act as a collective, forming what is essentially a cartel, to the detriment of users.Given that it's almost guarenteed to not pass in Bitcoin, I cant imagine it will pass in Litecoin.[deleted]We are together. 85% of the network is on the same page: not signaling for segwit.

Litecoin Foundation is a pretty new organization.  You may be thinking of the Litecoin Association. Also, there is a new litecoin forum:  Www.litecointalk.io

Why are you ranting if you are not even involved in Litecoin?  Just ignore it.More ETH shills showing up every day.  LTC must be doing wellUnfortunately Ltc has had its day. Maybe maybe if we are lucky we will see Ltc get to $6 before it drops again to $3.

Right now there are far more innovative and interesting crypto currencies on the market and that have an exciting roadmap of future features. Ltc doesn't.

Wonder what it would cost to rent enough to cause the switch. Are you sure that hash power wasn't already on a segwit supporting pool? Likely most rental rigs are mining at segwit pools already.

It feels good, but it's probably not actually doing anything to help activate segwit. Unless you're specifically going out and renting from miners who are on bw.com or ltc1btc."
2017-04-02 22:34:14;"ELI5 ""Miners"" Not wanting to upgrade to segwit.";"Fees go to the miners, and they always have. However with Litecoin they're typically too small to make a real impact. Currently the block reward is 25 LTC and the fees for a single block are typically on the order of 0.02 LTC; compare to Bitcoin where a *single transaction* has a fee of 0.05 LTC or more (rough conversion).

Bitcoin miners have incentive to block segwit to keep fees high and on-chain, but Litecoin miners don't have this same incentive since fees make up about 0.1% of their reward. My guess would be that Litecoin miners not signalling segwit are either:

* Planning to signal but not ready yet (apparently it's a complicated upgrade),
* Deliberately blocking segwit for Bitcoin-related political reasons (looking at you, LTC1BTC),
* Deliberately blocking segwit because they think it's bad for Litecoin, or
* Declining to upgrade because they don't think it's worth the effort.They take bribes from people like Ver and Jihan who want to centralize and control bitcoin. Segwit on LTC is not good for them so expect a double down attack and shill infestation as we close in on 75%."
2017-04-02 22:29:22;Whoah, why the increase?;"Ltc is very undervalued, segwit or not.I think it is a coordinated pump by some big whales. 

This group targets some coin: let's say Dash. Pump up the value, sell when it is on his max, buy lots of coins from another altcoin like litecoin. Repeat the same trick and.... easy money :) f2pool signaled setwit.Agreed, a pump but ltc is undervalued overall. "
2017-04-02 19:31:29;Segwit;"Honestly, the biggest advantage of segwit adoption is probably to prove that Litecoin can adapt & isn't deadlocked like Bitcoin. The ongoing Bitcoin civil war is leading some holders to switch to alts. For a while they avoided Litecoin because it didn't have the extra features of Dash and Monero or the large market cap of Ethereum. But with F2Pool's signaling of segwit, it suddenly appears that Litecoin is a version of Bitcoin that can scale, which changes the dynamic. (Disclaimer, I'm totally guessing here.)

Also, if Litecoin adopts segwit and the lightning network and it works well, that could spur support for segwit on Bitcoin. This in turn allows Bitcoin and Litecoin to be exchanged with one another atomically. (Bitcoin has full blocks and Litecoin has empty blocks; break down the barrier and the extra transactions could migrate over.)

So:

Without segwit:

* Litecoin = boring copy of Bitcoin. Imma buy some Dash instead.

With segwit:

* Litecoin = segwit testnet for Bitcoin, real-world economy included.
* Litecoin = Bitcoin without deadlock.
* Litecoin = Bitcoin sidechain (sorta).

edit:formattingI'm looking forward to the lightening network, confidential transactions, atomic cross chain transactions (when another certain chain pulls finger on segwit), smart contracts ... and so on. A whole lot of people are about to hop in here and tell you it'll bring a tidal wave of innovation, interest, business, and chickens to shoot us to the moon.  

I highly recommend asking for specifics.  Seeing as Litecoin is not under blocksize pressure or in real need of secondary protocol layer developments (which could be achieved by other methods like Rootstock or Omni protocol), Segwit really won't make much of a difference to the average user.  

I personally don't find these minor gains to be worth the complexity and untested data-economics changes (testnet is NOT a reflection of how these changes would pan out IRL), but hey that's my educated opinion on the matter.  

Bring on the haters.  "
2017-04-02 18:52:53;Segwit - Miners;"Less why?, no, segwit is what users and market need it only can be very good for price and price mean you will earn 2x-5x more... be smart switch to pool that support segwit (f2pool, etc)Probably not. 

Segwit activating on litecoin may bring in a flood of new users. Even with the off chain scaling that Segwit enables, you will be mining transactions that were previously out of reach. 

I could genuinely see litecoin taking in a lot of bitcoin speculators over the next few years if litecoin actually takes the lead with features like this.You will mine the same and the market price of LTC will be higher.I'm curious... where did you hear of the idea that you might make less?   Your block rewards stay the same. But every transaction that happens off chain (lightning network, sidechains etc) is one less transaction fee that you collect, if another path would have resulted in that transaction happening on chain instead. 

I really highly recommend you do your own independent research on Segwit instead of just asking here. "

wth : NO :)Added one updated supernode to the network.Cool, singalling on my .13.2 node. Thanks! Another question on my mind is if we activate segwit this way, doesn't that make those pools who are investing money just to block segwit feel like they are wasting their money by blocking something that we are going to go ahead and activate anyway? Because quite honestly, fuck them. Are the uasf.co site & saltylemon charts showing Litecoin UASF nodes as well? If not, is there a chart that shows which litecoin nodes are signaling for UASF?

By activating UASF, will this decouple LTC from BTC for good? What are the chances BTC will activate UASF? 
And, could activating UASF causes LTC to hard fork?Talked with okcoin support, first they asked me to explain what is UASF, then he sad:

""Dear user, I am sorry for the late reply. Thank you for your kind suggestion. IÂ´ve passed on to our operations team for reference.

The question now is when, and how quickly Charlie and his development team will implement some of the groundbreaking functionality he has been discussing (LN for example) to regain lost ground to other alts which quite frankly do not deserve their valuation.

My personal belief is MASF will happen this activation period, and we'll see a Coinbase LTC launch before the end of the activation period.I think Jihan realized he does not want UASF on Litecoin as its a good use case for Bitcoin. 

There is no good option for him now, either block and risk UASF or not block and allow Segwit on Litecoin> What if a big miner, for example Happychina and/or Le6oriAMKX

Everything is fine they haven't any Twitter account.Why would miners want to decrease their profits?

Obviously Jihan has vested interest in the BTC space. I agree with the others if they screw around in this activation period, it just gives UASF teeth which will snowball into BTC and really screw them over.

They have nothing to gain other than a short position by messing with segwit for LTC at this point. I definitely wouldn't rule this out but it will be a straight market manipulation over the short term, then we'll be back to MASF.Yeah, stuff can happen captain obvious. Your post is pointless."

Of course, that does not justify a DDoS, but rather than whining about being DDoSed on Twitter, they should focus on their own issues, and fix their Segwit signaling already.During the time of this ""DDOS attack"" they did mine 4 non-segwit blocks out of 20.. Hopefully just a coincident.  Was trying to get on their site to see what their hashrate was but their site was down.  This will be their reason for not signaling segwit. And don't be surprised if they suddenly gain enough hashpower to block it. We know Jihan has a shitload of L3+ miners freshly produced. 2x current hashrate as reported by Wang Chun.> Our Litecoin mining pool https://t.co/F5ifR8VnhS is under a targeted DDOS attack.

While I absolutely do not condone doing DDOS attacks, I couldn't help but smile at this tweet that complains of being victim of a ""targeted DDOS attack"".  Have you seen many DDOS attacks which were not ""targeted""?

(""Let's DDOS the entire Internet, that way we'll put down the site of XXXX!"")DDoS just makes us all look bad, I hope whoever is doing it stops and uses their time for something more productive.He's looking for a reason to block SegWit.If they don't want to be ddosed they should focus on signalling segwit before increasing their hash rate 10 fold in 48 hours.Not cool but I'm also noticing they are going crazy with their hash rate in the last 24-48hrs. They went from 1.8% to 4.2% of the total hash rate.ViaLTC is still increasing in hash power with one site now reporting 5.2% of hashrate not signalling SegWit.They said on twitter that there is a very little document about the technical of segwit and he needs some time to figure out how to support segwit correctlyI think ViaBTC planned to support segwit but then suddenly significant amount of new miners joined the pool (mainly those who do no support segwit, because they do not have anywhere else to go, and some those who support segwit but want manipulate the price by stopping it on this period). So they felt increase in their power and making more money than ever before, so current situation for them being one tree in park gives some advantages.

After version 2.8 the stability of Electrum has started getting much better, and I'm currently considering releasing a beta, which will probably be based on the upcoming Electrum 2.8.3.

Regarding SegWit support, it is still being worked on upstream. It's still experimental, and currently only available on testnet. But keep in mind that SegWit is a soft fork, and that even after it is activated Electrum-LTC 2.6.4.2 will keep working just fine."

If I want to sell 10 blocks of litecoins at an exchange, it will still cost the same transaction fees to open a payment channel to get these blocks to the exchange, right?  Unless we mine the transaction moving the blocks, the only time the Lightning Network saves fees is when money is already inside the network.

Perhaps someone can correct me if I misunderstand, but it seems like the Lightning Network will not solve the main problem of high fees when it occurs.

2) It will likely hurt Litecoin's mass adoption if the scaling solution for BTC takes place but this blocksize debate will be back and a consensus might be even tougher then. LTC would then be the stable candidate for testing out new blockchain technologies or avoiding higher fees on large transactions. Truly the only negative IMO is market performance. ;-)the only con of litecoin is that people don't know about it like they do bitcoin.Litecoin is a well established coin with over 5 years around. It is available in several markets and several FIAT-LTC pairs as well as CRYPTO-LTC pairs. Much harder to artificially pump a coin like this. You need very good global news to coordinate all markets and a lot of volume. Volume is back and we shall see a good pump in the coming weeks tho IMO.Ethereum is premined, and the market cap can therefore more easily be manipulated.


According to coinmarketcap.com NEM is ""Not Mineable"". You can not compare litecoin to something that is not even possible to mine.
Well, the price performance is a let down as of now.   
Adoption and realworld usage could be more, but I think it's still a solid nr2 next to bitcoin.    
Con or pro - it closely related to bitcoin and often used as a conversion currency.   
1) Probably because the market saw more profit gains in these coins and those markets were more easy to manipulate. But the volume we see in LTC now is more real usage, instead of market pumping.   
2) Certainly not useless, but yes this would make LTC less needed for real world operation. Hard to predict how much ahead LTC will be, when BTC finally reaches lightning network usage and how much the transaction fees will change. With the current fees LTC will prevail.1) it's supply X price = market cap.  The market sets the price, right now ppl are willing to pay ""ABOUT"" 0.01btc ($24usd) for it.  There's a ton of etc and the price is about $5usd, if they have 5x the supply of Litecoin that = bigger market cap.

2) most definitely. If btc gets scaling and tx fees where they should be its game over for most other alts except maybe Decred and others that focus on other things than payments.  When btc gets side chains it might be game over for those too if they can attract enough devs to keep working on that particular side chain.  Rootstock is releasing their ETH sidechain soon so we'll see what happens with that, might be game over for them in the next year or 2. 

These are just my opinions and I hope I'm wrong because I have a chunk of LTC & DCR I'd like to see skyrocket soonish. The biggest con by far for Litecoin is perception and optics.  It's sort of living under it's big brother Bitcoin's shadow.  And because of this reason it's more of a hold than trade coin when compared with other alt coins.  I am emphasizing the compared to other alt coins again because everything is Crypto is going to be very volatile.  Technically, it's Bitcoin 2.5, but needs marketing, spreading of awareness, and a possible rebranding.  Once use cases start coming out with the new companies adopting it on the live network, it's only a matter of time. However, if adoption lags behind its technology, other coins that are branded better, but don't even perform as well can over take it price wise.1)

* because no-one uses it
* because it replicates BTC without having any ideas or capacity to create code 
* because there are tens of decent payment alternatives in fiat and crypto that are better than LTC
* Its only traded on exchanges because chinese used to speculate on LTC. Thats not gonna happen forever.
 
2) Yes. It will be worth less than DOGE and XDN.

The hodlers and libertarian ideologues are a minority.it was perfectly productive for people who were taking short term profits.

2017-06-04 23:56:51;Very poor wealth distribution in LTC;"Exchanges u foolProbably top 10 addresses all belong to cold wallets on exchanges. Funds in those wallets are held by 10s of thousands of users (since  usually only whales/people with large amount of coin actually hold their coins in their own wallets). 

Trust me Litecoin's distribution is 100x better than any of the top 10 coins except for Bitcoin. Very interesting that there are so many addresses with round number balances (i.e 100K or 10K LTC)Ideally we could have better distribution.  I am sure there are a number of large accounts held by the same person or entity.  With that said if it is still better than bitcoin or dash.You wouldn't complain if they were yours Also would it matter some people were stacking for years and there investment is paying off just like bitcoin the more in use ltc because the more spread out you'll see it become just like bitcoin when holders sold huge amounts years ago when they reached there past all time highs of 30-1200 now most people that had thousands of bitcoin might only have a fraction of it now due to them cashing out after the crash. Litecoin will be the same once the prices rises maybe at 150-200 you'll see people cashing out and alot of other people buying it then you'll see alot more people with smaller amount due to the limited amount of coins available and high demand Sounds like Donald Trump.

2017-06-04 21:50:13;what are the differences between electrum ltc and Lite coin core?;"Litecoin core is a full node implementation which means it will download the full blockchain, electrum is a lightweight wallet that doesn't download the blockchain.From what I read, electrum-LTC is a deterministic wallet.  You need only write down the seed (on paper, for security reasons) and so long as you keep that seed safe, you can restore your wallet anytime, anywhere, on subsequent versions of the software.  You can also set up new electrum installations on other PCs in ""spectator mode"" only.  You can see the coins, but you can't spend them.  You do this by using (viewing then copying) the master public key from the original electrum-ltc wallet and choosing the ""restore wallet or import keys"" option on a new electrum-ltc installation, pasting the original master public key.  On a final note, electrum-ltc doesn't download the entire blockchain.  In case you use a Mac, the beta 2.8.3.2 version lags and freezes rather badly for me on Sierra 10.12.5, whereas the stable 2.6.4.2 version works great.

With Litecoin QT, this doesn't seem to be the case.  You have to backup the wallet.dat file.  Maybe someone can explain better, but from what I recall, if you were to use this wallet.dat file on multiple PCs, their first 100 addresses would be similar, after which things would get wonky(?).  This can potentially create serious problems later on as you'd have two versions of the wallet with possibly different balances.  Maybe someone can explain in better detail.Litecoin is decentralized, has a set limit of coins of 84 million to cause scarcity, as old as Bitcoin so survived other alts and the test of time. Future features such as smart contacts, atomic swapping , and lightning network being worked on and implement. Accepted by a while range of exchanges and vendors or plans to start accepting in the near future. Has a continuous ecosystem that can be seen growing today and not one of speculation and unproven potential.

Ethereum is centralized, it has a unlimited token Supply so inflation will happen. Is a new crypto , was not made to be a currency but a token. Total market value is due to PR and speculation of maybe future software. Total available coin have a high percentage premine and unavailable to the public and held by a small group of individuals estimated only 10% of those coins were made available to the public. Limited amount of vendors accepting it but high number of large exchanges trading it. 


There's more but those are the big ones that come to mind"
2017-06-04 21:45:52;What are the main differences from Bitcoin?;"4x larger supply and blocks mined every 2.5 minutes instead of every 10 minutes like bitcoin. 

My litecoin transactions lately have fees of around 3 cents , my bitcoin transaction fees have been as high as 6 dollars lately. 

Litecoin also activated segwit in May which is what bitcoin is trying to do in August. get some and use it and you will see....The four main differences: Litecoin has a blocktime of 2.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes, a maximum amount of coins 84 million instead of 21 million, the hashing algorithm of LTC is Scrypt instead of SHA256, and Segregated Witness is activated already. Other than that it's basically the same, because it's based on the Bitcoin software."

I spent about 6 hours doing TA and came up with some pretty easy to read charts detailing litecoin's price estimates at the 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month intervals from now which incorporates anticipated news releases during that time as well as expected increases in market cap. You can find them [here](http://i.imgur.com/736OFNs.jpg)Nobody really knows.  My best guess is that LTC is on a upward path generally, but likely will dip in the next week or two.

2017-06-18 22:56:22;Serious conversation about BTC Segwit;"Litecoin is undervalued. It shouldn't crash like that if Bitcoin succeeds. In fact, atomic swapping would probably make Litecoin a lot more valuable. 

Perhaps the biggest reason Litecoin is undervalued is because it isn't accepted as widely as Bitcoin. If you can swap Bitcoin and Litecoin like it's nothing, there would be no reason to accept Bitcoin but not Litecoin. 

Bitcoin atomic swapping = MoonI think holding both LTC and BTC is a sensible option that will leave you in a healthy hedged position regardless of the outcome come Aug 1st. There's enough volatility and risk in cryptos, I think hedging to reduce some of that and cover yourself is only sensible. With the long term upward trend in both, you should still find yourself with good returns.Bitcoin will split into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited. Core will stay BTC and have segwit and unlimited will be BTU and move from 1 to 2 megabyte blocks. So question is will the split kill both and LTC rise or will the split be successfully done and both just be normal crypto and LTC  stay same or crash... however if Core is successful then LTC and BTC could do atomic swaps and then it would be the perfect gold and silver of the crypto world wow just thought of thatSegwit and Litening Network is suppose to be good for both Bitcoin and Litecoin.  If both bitcoin and litecoin adopt these, then from what I've seen it will be great.  You could send someone Litecoin and they could receive it in Bitcoin if they wanted.  You could send transactions off the chain, saving fee's.  Its super complicated, but the creators of the Litening network are attempting to make it very simple.[removed]"

I think your posts are awesome.+777+777I think what you're doing is great but maybe be a little less in your face about it. We want LTC to be about the coin, Charlie, future tech, trading etc. We don't want the entire discussion here to be about a whale-vs-whale fight. And if you're too outspoken you might attract some whales that even you can't handle. Keep doing what you're doing just... let the market do what it wants to do to some extent and also maybe limit you posting a bit. Many thanks other than that, LTC has been on of the most stable coins and no doubt people like you are helping with that.Yes, I'd rather you posted than not. I find it interesting to read if I agree or don't agree with what you're saying. More information is better than less in this case. Plus overall I think you've had a positive impact where there's a lot of price speculation and memes.

2017-07-23 21:22:46;How often do you spend your litecoins?;"I literally have not touched my 100 LTC since buying them.I bought my ledger nano s with litecoin, and then used the fiat I was going to spend to buy more litecoin.Whenever I want to get some other altcoins I dont just buy btc. Im buying LTCs then convert them to btc and finally buy other coins (segwit enabled ones) using those btcs :)
This is my little contribution towards the Chickun.

We need to see exchanges offering LTC>altcoins pairing.This is where Litecoin truly has a problem. Most community members do not ever use their Litecoins, so we have very little to no Liquidity. 

I personally use Litecoin alot because I use it to transfer money. 

If Litecoin is to ever gain actual traction, you'll need people to SPEND litecoin and merchants to ACCEPT it. Litecoin now is pretty much Bitcoin 5 years agoI regularly tip people with LTC.  It's up to you I guess.  I use it for payment (same for my other cryptos)  as frequently as possible and just try to make sure I use fiat to replace whatever I spent. Figure it's better for the ecosystem to actually use them as intended instead of hoarding them all. I dont actually spend it but yes I daytrade sometimes 15% of my total LTC stack.  Never more then 15%.hodlpaid for vpn the other day.Id use it if I could pay for plane tickets/hotels I spend every day with my shift debit card attached to a coinbase wallet.HODL....i just started buying LTC and see it as an investment....don't ever really plan on spending it anywhere"

IMO this could replace bitcoin (it has a 22,000,000 coin cap). because it's basically the same thing but more user friendly and has an actual company behind it that is growing rapidly.

I've looked into Eth, Dash, and Ripple, but they either each have something amiss about them, or I feel they aren't going places. "

2017-08-13 23:16:56;QQ and the Chinese Litecoin community;"Try to register on a computer first.Qq is a total mess. Right now the Chinese government is requirement telecom companies to verify IDs of all its' users and it's likely they have a cap on how many foreign numbers they will take. Anyway no serious discussion is occurring on qq, I suggest if you speak Chinese to sign up at one of the major forums and talk to them there. There is also a chinese knock off of quora that should have some info on it, and you can ask where do they usually hang out.To add on to gideon4432's comment, some main platforms used are 

WeChat (å¾®ä¿¡ weixin) as a messenger and limited platform for smaller groups, 

Sina Weibo or just Weibo for short (æ°æµªå¾®å) as a microblogging site that had its discussions cut down big time a few years ago but is still prevalent, 

and Zhihu (ç¥å¼) which is a Chinese Quora clone.  

As previously mentioned it is not always convenient to be non-Chinese and sign up for Chinese platforms. I signed up for my qq about 5 years ago but that may have been before things tightened a bit. 

Additionally, you can't just go around spamming the benefit of digital currencies there like you can elsewhere where decentralization means something. As it is, the general public in the ""West"" has no idea what these currencies are for, can be swayed by mentioning ""people used it to buy drugs"", and has no idea of the manipulation the current financial system uses to profit. If you come with these already unpolished concept to the Chinese market, where to live here comfortably you are using quick local transaction smartphone wallet tech. in the form of Alipay and WeChat Wallet, you will be speaking to a deaf ear. 

In this region, a decent angle would be to go away from what are my normal principles and promote it as a gambling/investment/makeyoumoneynow ticket. But even promoting coins solely on the premise of profit, you have to realize that buying local in China has inflated prices. Buying on an exchange here, at least the last time I checked, is in a weird inspection phase where you can go through a 5-step process to register with an exchange, you can then buy coins, but you cannot withdrawal coins. You must first sell the coins then withdrawal RMB to prevent overseas money flight. Again, that was the last time I checked with btcchina (exchange). Anyway, things to keep in mind. "

2017-08-13 20:55:30;Verification of liteaddress.org signature returns -> BAD Signature;did you use the liteaddress.org from github?Yep, download from github.

2017-08-13 20:28:58;Litecoin better than Bitcoin Cash in every way. Lower fee, fast confirmation time, merchandise support and nice community;"Because it's not cAlled bitcoin2Merchandise support? The fuck is that?Part of the problem is that Litecoin's price is intentionally being shorted right now. Once this bullshit stops, you'll see the price go up.

I think Charlie Lee has been brutally honest with everybody about what his vision is for the altcoin... he doesn't want it to grow, he doesn't want it to overtake bitcoin, he doesn't even want it to be close to bitcoin's value. This is why he doesn't push this agenda in the media. He wants it to be used for smaller transactions, similar to how you would look at a checking account and savings account. 

I could see LTC hitting a $100, or more, range after BTC and LTC have lightning. Until then, don't expect much growth. There is simply not anything fancy looking to the outside derps that don't understand the technology at all.

To answer your question, the demand for bitcoin cash... part of this hike you are seeing in Bitcoin's price is directly related to people selling off their Bcash stakes to invest right back into ETH and BTC. They are simply seeing dollar signs, nothing more. The environment right now is actually quite toxic because greed has settled in. ETH corrected so damn hard that people just couldn't resist tossing money back into it, hoping it would drive back up (which it did, to some degree). Myself included - took advantage of this HUGE market correction last month, and made a shit ton of money on ETH. Sold it off after it broke 300 again, because I knew it wasn't going to see the frenzy it did before. 

I'm rambling now, but to answer your question directly, don't expect LTC to be in ETH or Bcash price range any time soon. These are simply more popular coins to day traders due to their huge potential for up and down movement. Because of that, there is a large demand for them, and a lot of activity.

If you were lucky enough to pick up some LTC around the $33 point, simply hold on to it. But don't think that this coin is going to make you a millionaire, because it simply won't. I think it's marketing issue. 

Like some said, not many people know about litecoin. First time I've heard of litecoin is when coinbase started trading them. 

When people talk about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin comes up first and it should as it's the fundamentals of cryptocurrency. 

All the media talks about Bitcoin vs ethereum and nothing else. They know about Bitcoin cash because it's closely related to the hard fork that affected the Bitcoin. If litecoin can be marketed better and get some more fame, that's when we'll actually go to the moon. Lol. SMH.  LolWell, who the hell is bitcoin cash? Are there people taking that thing serios? In fact litecoin is better than everything in everyway. Once you go LTC, you never go BTC.BCH will be a losercoinare we admitting core has destroyed bitcoin here?Because litecoin is an imitator while BCH is a different coin.

I am not saying this in a bad way but BCH is here because some people and miners wanted a non-segwit, big blocker chain which litecoin is no more. Hence the potential is different form store of value perspective. 

On the other hand litecoin is still cheap compared to BTC because there is nothing it offers on top. Development is lacking, adoption is trailing behind, investment is only a fraction of BTC etc. Also, low fee and faster confirmation advantages of litecoin is only valid against BTC until transaction numbers reach the same level. If LTC is adopted instead of BTC, there is no solution to ensure fees stay low or confirmation time stays fast, however big your block is unless it is dynamic it will get full. 

So from an investor perspective I would invest in litecoin if I want to:

- Keep my money in a stable crypto for a short period during trading because LTC is always silent and trouble free.
- If I believe BTC is doomed and will fail due to governance issues

But I would not put my money on LTC because :

- I believe LTC is better than BTC.
- I believe LTC is undervalued.

LTC is silently trailing bitcoin to find the perfect opportunity to attack. The first opportunity was blocks getting full and this made LTC jump extremely yet BTC eluded complete failure. Now LTC has to wait again for a similar situation and we'll see if that comes. Until that time the price of LTC will be very stable and move much less than other coins.Who uses Bcash? No one. Stop worrying.There only one coin, BTC. Anything else is aftermarket, spinoff, duplicate, alteration, scam or ponzi. What did Charlie do that is different from the creators of BCH?The worst thing is that OP is not even shilling. Looks like really believing.

As for BCH: the way it looks _now_, BCH is no different from LTC -- nice but useless. 

However there is one important thing about BCH: it's a fucking insurance in case things go unexpected direction.

I have no problems seeing zero price of my (free) BCH  one day, I won't regret not selling it for 10%, I do want to keep my insurance.Nobody cares about litecoin.

Charlie Lee made an absolute fool of himself on TV and proved he himself has no idea why litecoin should be used."
2017-08-20 19:45:48;Why is it called decentralized and not distributed?;"Decentralization is more on governance than infrastructure.

Think of banking systems, they all run on distributed servers as well, but with a central point of control. That was one of the reasons why bitcoin was created in the first place, not to solve fail over or fault tolerant issues, but to remove central point of control.From a development side it may be more decentralized than it is from the way it actually runs.  Just my guess.  It's to differentiate itself from the centralized form of currencies that we've traditionally seen. Our fiat currencies are distributed, but they are centralized in that a single authority can control the supply. https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/7812/question-on-the-terms-distributed-and-decentralised

Also with 2nd layer transactions in devt, the fees might remain low for a long time.Sorry to break it out to you but that will never happen (Even charlee lee knows it).

If you would like to keep your litecoins ""liquid"" so to speak (easily exchangable for other coins) it is recommended to keep them in a hot wallet (software wallet). For this I prefer Exodus, as it has shapeshift built-in, which means you can exchange Litecoin to Bitcoin or some other coins from within the wallet, without using an exchange. Just look at https://www.exodus.io/. It is for Windows/Mac/Linux only though (no mobile platforms like Android/iOS). For mobile platforms you can use Jaxx for example.

Other then the nice impact of hype, what is the purpose of this? They actually have one at Southcenter Mall in Tukwila. Pretty nice to see people use it.Considering these cryptos are starting to be treated like cash (meaning used very, very often) it makes me think not many people are actually going to pay the capital gains tax on these.

Also maybe I don't fully understand how the taxes work and I'm blabbering on about nothing. How much time does it take ? I know the guy that works for this company and he said he'd waive my fees. It's also costing like 10 % when you deposit cash. It's fucking dumb. And he was an ass and never waived fees so I never used it. Stupid. Where is it? I'm in Seattle! Man, is there any sort of anonymous machines? A key point of crypto was its ability to be anon. Why is there a camera up on it, it probably also ask for my photo ID to be stored on their server smh. If I am paying cash that shouldn't be hard to verify by itself with all the tech that goes into the bill these days. Can you withdraw money from it or is it a invest-on-the-go type of machine?Anyone know if these are a decent enough investment? I remember reading about them somewhere around 2014 or 2015 but the machines were stupid expensive. Where??????? i'm a localDid you use it?There are 2 cypto-currency machines in Brighton UK currently. To my knowledge one basically just says BTC and LTC. The other is allows withdrawals but only accepts BTC :(Fees around 6%Just scan your passport? Lol "

2017-09-03 22:30:41;Electrum Wallet Question;"Hey man.  

Read this article to understand wallets: https://medium.com/the-litecoin-school-of-crypto/2-understanding-wallets-8e1967ce8459

basically, priv keys-> pub keys-> addresses.  So pub keys are not addresses but are used to create addresses.  That's why they don't match up.  

If you want the priv key to a specific address, right click on the address you want.  click on ""private key"" in the drop down menu to reveal it.  You can use any address you want.  Just choose one.

Also, the order of your priv/pubkeys in the csv should be the same order in electrum for what it's worth.From the application. And it will always change when you close and open Electrum again. Also be careful with those exported csv files since they contain private info from your funds. "

2017-09-10 20:23:35;Sponsorship?;"Alright.  Here's what I suggest:

1. Verification photos of members with ID's and paper with a word I specify.  Similar to exchange verification processes.
2. Multisig address with me or another mod. You publicize the public address so we can watch it. Show proof of receipts/expenses when you want to cash out.
4. I'm just a mod.  I don't represent litecoin foundation.
5. Any who's interested in donating comment below so we can get a feel if there's enough interest to actually follow through with it.I can see some people complaining about self-advertising here, though I myself don't care.

What would we be sponsoring? What do you guys plan on achieving in the next year? 5 years?we can google your team but how do continue from here? who are you on the team overview page? where do we send funds? how we do know it's you?...

have you checked with litecoin foundation?You're going to the moon, right? I'm in!Honestly, this is a cool Idea. But if you're going to do it, I would suggest making another post, with a typical reddit verification process. As well as a litecoin wallet address for ""donations"", and then either work on getting the community to back you (like the mods as well as the members), and at the very least promise to put a sticker on the rocket so we can humble brag that we got to the moon too :)

2017-09-10 20:23:18;Litecoin & Ledger;"What character does the Litecoin address start with? L or 1 or M or 3?Hm, haven't encountered such an issue when switching between BTC and LTC. Maybe ask the guys in the ledgerwallet sub to provide support for that specific case. Also on good thing coming for the  ledger should be the new unified all that they are developing. Will probably take some time though. Hope you get your issue resolved.aybe link back here once you got a solution. Hey cSly, I'm having the same issue with my Ledger. To access your BTC wallet again, you only need to syncronize your BTC wallet(Settings->Tools). However I couldnt make a LTC deposit into my account so far, as Im receiving that invalid error too. I emailed Ledger but I'm still awating for a reply back...Just reset the app data, and select whatever you want. Legacy or Segwit. Just do not tick the ""remember my choice"" box. You'll have to choose between legacy and segwit every time, but it will open you litecoin everytime correctly. 

When you do tick that box and you, for example, open your bitcoin wallet first. It will remember that and when you try to open your litecoin wallet after that, the bitcoin wallet will open again"
2017-09-10 19:03:52;As a new or veteran (but small) investor, what makes/made LTC your preferred crypto?;"Undervalued: Strong team. Great Technology. Fast Payments. BUY!Tech specs  
Fair release  
Active creator and dev team  
Track record  
Utility  
Community  I wanted to see if my money could make more money. it made more money.For me it was consistent gains with allot of room to growCheap, cheap transaction, and fast as shit, good community, no political drama like btc so far ahead on segwit lightning  pretty sure its severly undervalued at the moment even at ath i still thought it was plus im not so sure having front man is the best thing think vitalik death rumor but charlie is not a pumper level headed and smart so not that worried about itBought in during March and April pretty heavily. Scary thing is I had only invested in ETH beforehand. It was a bday present for me to watch LTC boom up to $40 and ETH go on a bull run at the same time. This feeling of euphoria alone was enough to make me a certified holder. I still buy some every payday. Truly believe that any LTC cheaper than $100 USD is extremely undervalued. 

The community is pretty cool, too. Undervalued imoStill fairly cheap and a lot of room to grow. Low risk/high reward! Long term potential. It's not a matter of if it is a matter of when. The highs and lows only keep becoming higher. Strong fundamentals. I do my buying from coinbase, and its cheap enough to have multiple coins. Gains have been less volatile so far but more conssistent. 


I'm branching lout into other coins, but its such a hassle, so i'll stick with ltc as my main coin for now.It has the strongest technicals in the entire sector.
Steady bullish movement for the entire year is very hard to beat. I don't think I've seen anything else this solid. 

The trend is strong with this one.If/when atomic swaps is an option I think it has the potential to equalize it's ratio with bitcoin.  4 to 1symbiotic relation with BTC: I expect atomic swaps to pull price of Ltc up since both will be exchangeable at a very low cost (time and fee)

Also a hedge against Sathoshi's stack of a million Btc, which I believe would crash BTC price if ever movedThe simple fact this crypto has a longer history makes me want to buy. Tech can always be copied and paste. A team can always grow or fall. The history however, will always be there. This is why I buy only LTC and BTC. I also predict LTC passing ETH as soon as this is known. bucksFast transactions. No bullshit drama like Bitcoin. Not stupid ridiculous requirements like requiring 20XRP minimum in a Ripple wallet. https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/search?q=why+litecoin&restrict_sr=on&t=all"
2017-09-10 18:58:27;CryptoCurrency and Apple;"tl;dr. What do you want to say?Draft a letter and send it off. Then share so I can read it too. Also, maybe you'd want to talk to the Litecoin Community Alliance folk. They're extra motivated like you and could probably assist with organizing this endeavor.Sign me up :+)

One issue I see with this is that we should probably research spam filtering methods that big organizations use to make sure that our emails actually go through. If it were only a handful of people with some similarly-worded draft sent to companies, perhaps they would slip through the spam filters. However, if those filters get annoyed by the email barrage, that would be problematic for the cause.Loafwallet - Apple iMessage send - like the Apple pay Feature is on its way.Apple... Man, I'm sooooo sorry...  But hey, I'm a long time believer in forgiveness, and letting every man be judged by his own deeds.

When I can't get what I want... I don't look at who's to blame, I figure it out for myself.  Don't try to change Apple, just go Android.  For crypto anyways!Dude it's 2017, not 1997... Nobody will read this. Why do you think Twitter is a success."

2017-09-17 23:37:08;Know when to hodl em;I'm not selling until they get to $8k each. My plan is to never sell, like ever. I will use my LTC when it becomes mainstream & I can spend it almost as easily as I can spend fiat rather than sell it which at this point, I should be pretty darn wealthy. I'll just try to buy a house with ltc thus avoiding any tax the government wants to steal from my profits. Failing that, I'm taking my encryption keys to my grave.Sell for fiat? Never. Only time I will sell is for BTC when the ratio becomes too extreme. And even then, I'll still come back later. A bit like how gold bugs only cash in into silver and back again. My captial is never going back into the evil fiat paedo-banksta-illuminati system ever again. Sucks to be you, jamie demon.I will sell some along the way up to whatever price. Reason being to get my initial investment back. Can't go wrong from there then! I decided to invest all my savings and hold till 5 years from now. Then I will start selling at whatever price is at but only fractions so I can retire at my 30`s2 weeks! Lol

2017-09-17 20:27:32;If I purchase litecoins from coinbase app. How do I spend them?;"I would suggest downloading loafwallet, transferring you LTC to that & using this to purchase whatever it is your wanting to purchase. After I buy them on coinbase. How do I send them to loafwallet? Will there be an option to transfer them or something? Thanks for the help btw Will loafwallet allow me to transfer my ltc to a bank account or credit card? I live in Canada and am unable to cash out from Coinbase. Any suggestions ??https://www.shiftpayments.com/card

I purchased a shift card for $10 that you can link to your coinbase ltc wallet and then use it as if it's a visa debit card. Basically you can spend your ltc on anything, anywhere. It sounds too good to be true, but it's not. I just bought player unknown background on steam using my card. I don't see any down side to this, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but this basically turns your ltc wallet into a checking account. Absolutely amazing.Yeah you need to not be looking at dashboard and instead go over and open up your LTC wallet Wisely [deleted]"
