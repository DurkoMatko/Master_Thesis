Why not have a big primary button where 'how this works is' saying 'Make an offer for $X'?Anyone have any feedback? Things you like? Things you don't like? I'd love to hear your comments, I'm pretty new to bootstrap so everything helps!From a sales standpoint... there is nothing on your site that encourages urgency to bid.

2013-03-05 15:55:43;Question about adding image link to navbar;"Nevermind. I found it.

I had to add a class to the <a> tag for those icons then in the CSS I had to override:

    .navbar-inverse .nav > li > a.social-links {
        padding: 0px;
        margin: 0px;	
    }
    Not to be nitpicky or critical... just thought I would share a slightly better was to handle those ""if section"" snippets.

    <li<?php echo ($section == 'home')?' class=""active""':''; ?>>

This will save a little bit of unnecessary characters/html and is still less code. 

Also, you really don't need curly braces when the if statement is all on one line. The following is valid.

    if ($x == $y) echo $n;
    echo ($x == $y)?$n:''; // same thing

This is called a Ternary (evaluation)?case true: case false;"

1 - A Base Theme is a theme that doesn't change the color palettes fonts, etc. of bootstrap, but is instead the HTML underpinnings (aka buttons have a class 'btn' on them, etc.) necessary to get Bootstrap working on a particular CMS. 

A good example for Wordpress would be BootstrapWP - http://bootstrapwp.rachelbaker.me/ - but at this point there is at least one base bootstrap theme for every CMS and for popular ones such as Wordpress maybe dozens.

2. A Bootstrap 'skin' is a CSS file that you can just drop into the head of an HTML document to apply styling throughout the page. Good examples are those from Bootswatch - http://www.bootswatch.com

2013-04-26 20:25:22;How to use media queries responsibly?;"My interpretation would be, ""for a bigger project, don't use media queries at all, make a mobile site"" like m.reddit.com instead of regular reddit. By definition, if you're using media queries, you're always serving *some* up CSS that doesn't get used. A dedicated code base means a separate mobile site, which can be easier to maintain but will require publishing content twice: once on your main website and once on your mobile site. Plus, you'd have to decide which was the main location via canonical URLs to avoid duplicate content penalties.

For the purposes of a website I'd say you should have at least 50 pages before you even think about maintaining two code bases. As BonChicBonScott said, ""if you're using media queries, you're always serving some up CSS that doesn't get used"", but that's not always that important because CSS is tiny. The issue is larger and it is images and external assets (unnecessary requests and download size - Chrome developer tools > Network tab) which are downloaded but not shown the the user.

I'm not sure I'd agree with the statement you quoted. There's a lot of uncertainty as to the best approach to mobile, but a mobile-first approach (think progressive enhancement) is probably your best bet for anything less than a massive corporate site.

Finally, don't get caught by the ""multiple canvases"" trap; responsive design shouldn't mean you get to layout your content for viewport widths of x, x and x - you should plan the in-between as well because who knows what device sizes and pixel densities will be available in a year?

Hope this helps - happy designing!"

What should be inside that DIV when you show it? The form from the login page. Just from the <form>  to the </form>. So whatever HTML the login page displays, copy the form from that and paste it into your dialog DIV. 

The only thing I can think which could go wrong is the action attribute of the form, make sure any directory paths in its action are still correct when submitted on your front page. Codeigniter is a PHP framework. This has nothing to do with bootstrap."

Will take a lot of work to update sites to be compatible.I'm getting killed in the Javascript migration. The BS 3 CSS migration is relatively easy but the new Javascript is breaking some of my plugins and it's becoming a major pain in the ass to fix.

I've been using [X-editable](http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/index.html) for awhile now and it's worked great but I'm getting killed trying to migrate it to BS 3. Does anyone use this and/or have any luck getting it to work on BS 3? Someone posted on GitHub some things they found to help migrate over and that they got it working overall but were still working out some kinks. They said they were going to branch out their modifications when they were done but who knows when they will be. One of his suggestions doesn't seem to be working for me and I've spent several hours trying to debug it to no avail.

Edit: Looks like I got it to work, at least the basic editableForm object. Still some styling issues, working those out now. If anyone is interested in my fix let me know.I was building a site with a pre release build and found that the mobile nav collapse button didn't work on touch screens unless I did something special to fix it (can't remember off the top of my head, something to do with a or button) nd I see that bug has made it into the releaseI really love that they're finally making some changes to become more semantic.I like it.
Flatter buttons. The others are too much in shadows, especially as bootstrap is used quite often these times and I think less is more.
Vector icons: scalability and styling just by pure css. Just like http://fontawesome.io/ 
less support: don't know if this is knew. But makes it easier to compile and use just modules you need.I don't really like the new flat style, it feels so empty and boring. So for the time being I'll stick with 2.3.2 until that changes. :)I don't like the out of the box design. I understand its made to be customized, but v2 out of the box was pretty clean.  A purple nav bar? Come on.It will fuck your site with the force of a thousand dicks if you drop it on an existing site.  3.0 is an entirely different framework. It's nothing like bootstrap 2.  So far every element on the site I upgraded has had to be upgraded to work properly.  And it sucks. Nothing has default styling."

Install bower: http://bower.io/ (""npm install -g bower"")


Install with Bower: ""bower install bootstrap""

Install grunt-cli: ""npm install -g grunt-cli""

In the directory where you have the bootstrap files: ""npm install""

Then you are pretty much finished. Everytime you want to work do a ""grunt watch"" and edit the .less files. grunt will automatically watch for any changes and compile on save. You will get a bootstrap.css. This should be linked in your site.

Get to know LESS. It will blow your css-mind! http://lesscss.org/ 

Just ask if you get stuck somewhere and need a more detailed description.

Are you familiar with HTML and CSS? Do you have something you want to build?

Jeykll is for building a blog with static files, if that is what you plan to do, go for it. When it comes to Grunt, that will minify your files, as much as everyone around here says it is a requirement... if you deliver code to non dev people.. that is something I don't do. I might minify JS, but not CSS. So that comes down to the project.

My suggestion? Get the unminified versions of the bootstrap files. Build a static HTML website. Figure out adding in the extra tools to your toolbox later on as you need them and one at a time. I usually only introduce 1 thing at a time to my workflow and every day someone has the newest hippest tool. You could spend the rest of your life trying to keep up, figure out your workflow and add things that benefit it."

2013-08-15 15:13:21;Can't get this Bootstrap CDN to work...;"Can you upload a picture of what you're seeing? Can't be sure of what's happening unless we see what's happening.Change the line

    <link href=""//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0-rc1/css/bootstrap.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" />

to:

    <link href=""http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0-rc1/css/bootstrap.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" />

That is, add ""http:"" right before the ""//"".

Links on the web need a protocol - that's the http or https that you'll see at the beginning of a link. Sometimes, in cases like this, you'll see just ""//"" - without an ""http"" or ""https,"" because if you're serving up a page via https and you include the CSS file with just http, the visitor could see errors about insecure content.

In this case, you're actually using the ""file"" protocol - which tells the browser that you're opening a local page. So the browser is looking for a file on your computer at the path netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0-rc1/css/bootstrap.min.css - so it's looking for a netdna.bootstrapcdn.com folder next to your HTML file, which it can't find. So adding the ""http:"" to that line will tell your browser - go out on the internet, find a server called netdna.bootstrapcdn.com and look for this file.

Hope this helps!

Edit: just looked at the final code - do the same with the reference to font-awesome.css as well."

It's a static website generator written in Ruby. 

This will let you avoid having redundant code (such as page navigation, footer, etc.) and still have static content as a result, which you can upload to any web host, so you don't have to set up a WordPress or RoR environment.check out [900 dpi](http://900dpi.com/),

Basically you use dropbox as your host.I second the Jekyll suggestion. You can even host it for free on GitHub pages, so every time you push a commit, it will update your site.

2013-10-11 22:26:38;"Why do we need to ""install"" Bootstrap (with Bower.io)? Isn't it just static content?";Bower just downloads those static assets for you based on a package list, similar to any other package manager. It's just for convenience/laziness. I have not used Bower.io, however my guess is that it makes for easy updating, similar to PHP's Composer. I definitely just download a compiled package and upload the three folders (er... js, css, and img, iirc) - then usually start with a template from someone and fix all the directory disagreements and customize it to my heart's content.

2013-10-23 02:23:06;Confused with bootstrap 3.0's various column sizes now...;"The xs, sm, md, lg just tell what column width to use depending on the break points for the screen sizes. 

So if I had:
    <div class=""col-sm-6 col-lg-10"">

The div on a full desktop would render the full 10 columns while a small screen device would render only at 6. All automatic, no need to mess with the media queries.
Hopefully that helped.one thing that took me a while to understand is why there's no generic .col-* declaration.

Because of the mobile-first approach, it means all divs within a .row are going to be full width, unless specifically declared.

The way I've learned to do it is to start with everything in ""pancake mode"" (stacked up in layers full width), and then separate them by screen resolution, in ascending order (start small, go up).

Any higher resolutions will always inherit the layout of its smaller level - so:

<div class=""col-sm-6"">

means that both md and lg will use ""6"" for its column because it's inherited. so you don't need to specifically declare them unless you want to change them.

this gets confusing because if you go *below* @small, then it'll be full width unless you specifically declare .col-xs-*, which will then force columns in small mobile layouts.

Answer to my first questions is: It is called smooth scrolling.

Answer to my second is:

You need to alter the script which does the smooth scrolling at the bottom of index.html. Find this line at the bottom:  

`    <script>`  
`        $(function() {`  
`              $('a[href*=#]:not([href=#])').click(function() {` 

Change that last line to this:  

`$('a[href*=#]:not([href=#]):not(.eliminate)').click(function() {`

Now you need to add a class of ""eliminate"" to any anchor link which you don't want to be affected by smooth scrolling.

So..  
<a href=""#somesection"">some section</a> becomes  
<a href=""#somesection"" class=""eliminate"">some section</a> 

Basically all you are doing is telling the script not to trigger on anchor links with a class of eliminate. "

Now the bootstrap grid has classes for column spans for different screen sizes and it's a bit more complicated.

I don't know how you learn best, but I just didn't *get* it until I actually tried to use the grid on a project, so I'll recommend you do that too.

That's enough to gradually reduce the size of the logo so that it scales well. It gets down to around 234px before needing another query, but at that point the logo is unreadable anyway so it's moot.

1. Are you using the css stylesheet from your *bootstrap-3.0.0/examples/carousel* folder? If so, continue reading. If not, skip to 6.
2. Open up that stylsheet and scroll to the section that says: **/* CUSTOMIZE THE CAROUSEL */**
3. Underneath that, there's a subsection that says **/* Declare heights because of positioning of img element */**
4. Comment out those two rule blocks underneath (*.carousel .item { ... }* and *.carousel-inner > .item > img { ... }*)
5. That should do it! If not, continue reading.
6. Did you declare heights to any rules pertaining to the carousel in your bootstrap stylesheet (or any other stylesheet)?
7. Get rid of them, by declaring a height, you're not allowing the carousel to change it's height, but to keep it at its declared height regardless of the view port being resized and the image shrinking horizontally.

Hope this helped!Try setting a min-height of the image"

You'll need to do quite a bit of reworking of your HTML to make it compliant with 3.1.1.  Honestly, I'd ask yourself if you can live with 2.3.2, or if 3.* is something you really need.  It will take several hours to convert all of your HTML (depending on your site size) to newer Bootstrap standards.LOTS of stuff changed. In the HTML it no longer uses span- for example. It would be col-lg-12.

Try a migration tool online like http://upgrade-bootstrap.bootply.com

2014-02-24 16:01:17;Having trouble with centering multiple boxes within a container.;"You need to apply the centering class to the parent container. I'm not sure what it is since I haven't used bootstrap in a while. Look up some tutorials for centering with CSS and you will figure it out. It's fairly simple to understand. Best of luck!There is no bootstrap class called pull-center . There is a class called center-block, which basically just does the left right margin:auto trick.each of your columns are 

<div class=""col-md-2 text-center"">

and you have 4 columns:
so thats 8 total columns

a row is 12 columns so you are 4 short.

thats why its pushed to the left cause you have allocated 12 spots and only taken 8.

Easy fix: change it to <div class=""col-md-3 text-center"">
for each item.  

Another fix: add and offset to the first one.

so
<div class=""col-md-2-offset-2 text-center"">

The first fix will make the elements bigger to fit the whole row, the second one will just shift them over 2 spots and keep them the same size. 

good luck"

If there's a new feature that's really worth upgrading for, branch your code and do the upgrade. I did this on a couple sites when 3.0 came out, but left most of my existing sites alone. After vetting 3.1, I started using it for new development. But again, my 2.3.2 sites didn't break the day 3.0 came out.

And you've probably seen this, but the [2.3.2 docs](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) are still easily available.1 - you don't have to update if you don't want to!  if your site works on 2.x, leave it on 2.x

2 - if refactoring is a huge pain, that might be because you have a lot of duplicate code that needs updating.  that is not a bootstrap problem, but a code duplication problem.  with the .less version of bootstrap, you can with a little work approximate the 'semantic HTML' dream of not having to put class=""table table-bordered table-striped table-hover"" all over your code.I always update my starting point files to latest and greatest, but once the project starts I don't upgrade those files for the most part.

There is also [bootui](http://www.bootui.com) but the interface is hideous (check your volume if you are going to watch the video, that voice!)

I do like the idea of a stand alone tool, the monthly subscription model of some of the online GUIs is becoming a little too common.

As usual, the problem with a wysiwyg is they do seem to raise more problems than they solve.

I did go through most of the GUIs listed on article on [mashable.com](http://mashable.com/2013/10/20/bootstrap-editors/)

They all have pros and cons and I don't use one as it is so easy to hand code. 

But I would potentially use such a tool to very quickly prototype something.

edit, just found this [http://www.briqs.co](http://www.briqs.co)I would, if it was easy to use. I would!Yes, given a) Decent UI and, b) It actually outputs decent code.A conversion tool to take a document with specified version of bs and convert to another version would be good. Should also be able to update software to latest bs versions and upgrade documents as well.I'd try it out if you could edit the code or add in custom css and javascript. I heard of this thing called pingendo I am not sure if it good but I thinks its a native mac application. I used this webbased build it is very cool [Typepick](http://www.typepick.com/) it adds in php for you. I would give it a shot sure. Especially if I could get a limited version for free or something, I wouldn't mind spending a couple of bucks on it if I liked it and I intended to keep using it.  A GUI program written in Java(or some other language), storing information sent through a GUI and then parsing it back into bootstrap to finally position an HTML element....Honestly, I personally would not.  It's just too much abstraction.

I feel like bootstrap is simple and quick enough that anything you throw around it is never going ""to make it better"".  That being said, I am sure people would use it and it would definitely be a cool program to build.  

Good luck!"

They run the backend script which processes the forms for you. It's targetted to people who are running static sites (e.g. HTML/CSS only). It's free for 1000 emails per month.

Shouldn't take more than a few minutes to set up. Hope this helps!Worst case, you can have the form just send an email to the business as a notification of a new appointment.

if you want you can pm me, i´ll help sort things outWhat do you want to do with the data when the form is submitted?  Store it in a database?  Email it to the owner of the website?Basically you want all the data in the form to be sent to a php page.  That php page will handle the emailing.

Form tag should look like this:

    <form action=""file/path/to/file.php"" method=""post"">

Then when you click the submit button, all that data is magically sent to the php page you put in the form's action attribute.

On the php page:

    <?php
    
    if (isset($_POST[""required_value_from_form""]))
        {
        $from = $_POST[""from""];

2014-04-08 17:19:16;Can Internet Explorer support be removed without breaking anything?;"I believe you can remove these lines safely if you don't need IE support. The conditional comment there is pretty straightforward: if IE lower than 9....I recommend looking up progressive enhancement. The way this works is by laying things on to improve the experiences for your users. So without these lines you are just removing support for older browsers. However you may be rendering the page completely useless for some users. It is worth testing to ensure the site remains useful. Yes I know we don't really feel like it is important to support those ~3% but as designers our job is to design for those edge cases. Thumbs up for not supporting IE.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  IE is a total waste of time.  Most of the stuff I design works in normal browsers then I test in ie and all of sudden the need for hacking and altering my code never ends. Google this and google that just to make that piece of crap of a software to work. If all developers would boycott support for ie we'd be done with this rather quickly.

My plan is to create a basic html / css for IE users, then include conditional statements to redirect users of normal browsers to a different stylesheet. Voila! problem solved.  They want to use IE, here's a table for your display.  Sure, if you can, tell them to get a real browser.Not sure why you would want to remove IE support, that conditional code has nothing to do with IE6. Bootstrap doesn't officially support IE6 so you've got some custom hacking to do"

2014-04-30 17:14:51;How to wrap bootstrap so it does not conflict with CMS's javascript or (even worse) the CMS's CSS if it happens to be built with Bootstrap (like Concrete5);"For the jQuery issue have you tried:

https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/

or even just name-spacing your version of jQuery to something other than $?

As far as the CSS issue, I would recommend pre-fixing all your CSS with something unique.

somethingUnique h1 { style: stuff }

<h1 class=""somethingUnique""></h1>

The issue with this is getting the Bootstrap CSS to play nicely, which means digging into it and pre-fixing all the defaults with somethingUnqiue.

What actual problem(s) are you trying to solve? I've worked on several projects where the CMS utilizes Bootstrap, and I've never ran into a situation with my styles colliding with the CMS'. For JavaScript, you could use a closure. But, again, I'm not sure this is the solution that makes the most sense without knowing the actual problems you're having."
2014-04-30 16:05:27;Bootstrap button: How can I get the entire button to be active rather than just the text inside the button?;"So this is interesting... I fortunately found a bootstrap button generator that helped me figure out a different way to approach buttons:

http://www.bootply.com/134375

code now is:

    <a href=""http://www.google.com"" target=""_blank"" class=""btn btn-success btn-large butt"">
        Go to Google.com →
    </a>

----

So, when would you ever use the <button type=""button""> code rather than adding the button class directly to the a href? Never? The answer you gave in the comments is the most correct approach.  But let's consider, for some other reason, you absolutely had to use all the markup you provided.  You could fix your issue by wrapping the button with the anchor (rather than the anchor with the button) like so:

    <a href=""http://www.google.com"" target=""_blank"">
       <button type=""button"" class=""black-button biz-button"">Go to Google.com →</button>
    </a>

2014-05-06 03:20:18;Question about using Bootstrap-Magic inside.;"Created a theme in magic?

What is magic?It's likely that your magic theme will not change all the possible elements available in bootstrap. It will simply change the elements have specified, leaving many values set to their bootstrap default. When you replaced bootstrap.css these default values were lost. 

Instead of replacing the old bootstrap css file, try referencing both your bootstrap.css and magic.css, making sure magic.css has priority. This way if a value is not defined in magic.css it can still be defined from bootstrap.css. 

Hope it works! The theme likely needs to be loaded on top of Bootstrap. So include both in your head and make sure the theme is loaded last"

so that your drop down menus align left and don't center even though the navbar does.  I had to figure this out for a site that actually has a double navbar in a non-fixed position below a logo that is still responsive.

Both navbars open independently as well. It still does not look pretty but it is slowly getting there."
2014-05-05 14:00:26;Help-a-Newbie: Fetching Blogger data using Google API for use on Bootstrap site;"These are separate things. Bootstrap is presentation, the API is content. They don't/shouldn't  depend on each other. Okay so I solved the problem myself, and I thought I would share in case anyone else is stuck.

Basically to get this working I needed to use the Google PHP Client Library (http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest) and install them onto my webserver so that I could use PHP to request data down the Google API.

My server is a raspberry pi so it's relatively easy for me to do as I have full control, but Google have some great documentation about getting it set up (https://developers.google.com/gdata/articles/php_client_lib#gdata-installation)

The developers.google.com resource is vast and will tell you everything you need to know, but I found it quite hard to grasp as a newbie, this video helped clear it up a little for me:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtrFZmZjalE

2014-05-12 22:57:15;Best offline way to learn;"Bootstrap isn't really difficult to learn, but I suppose it matters on your understanding of HTML & CSS.

I'd definitely pre load these pages into your browser, or at least right click > save them on to your desktop or somewhere. http://getbootstrap.com/

It's almost like a ""manual"".

I'd almost definitely check out the examples they give you on the different types of navigations, carousel, scaffolding etc too. Again, it might be a good idea to right click > save these as you might be needing to save a copy of the CSS or HTML they use.

For learning Bootstrap:

Bootstrap itself, a sketchbook, and some Micron 05 pens. Maybe a PDF copy of the bootstrap docs.

Sketch out some UIs you'd like to be able to build, and build them.

For CSS/HTML itself, I'd just replace the Bootstrap PDF from above with a reputable book on the 2 subjects. I can't make a recommendation, since I never read any physical books on those topics.lynda.com videos?I think the documentation they provide is good, it is fairly easy once you initially get the hang of it. You can download the entire source and run the documentation locally https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap#documentation. Or if that is too much of a hassle, a program to save the webpages as PDFs would work."
2014-05-12 21:53:02;Moving Elements Above/Below Navbar;"the valid approach is to insert it into your template twice then show/hide the proper one depending on the viewport size. However, I'd encourage you to settle on either one version that is above/below the navbar.

2014-05-09 16:15:32;Using Bootstrap for a tool within a WordPress site--how to make the style sheets seamless?;I highly recommend using [http://roots.io](http://roots.io). It's for Bootstrap themes and it does a lot of cool things like relative URLs. So instead of your css location showing up as /wp-content/themes/yourtheme/css/style.css it will change it to /assets/css/style.css and nobody will even know you're using WordPress.
2014-05-19 18:39:24;Inserting Icons Into Forms;"I'd guess that it is- do you have a URL I can take a look? 

From my experience though, I always add an id to the field where the calendar is, then I style that particular ID because it'll take precedence over the default styling.

Just make sure you style it after the bootstrap stylesheet have loaded."
2014-05-18 05:11:41;Admin Templates;"You can use bootstrap in various ways. If you were using php or C# to create a custom admin page, you could use one of those templates to display your data. Those templates don't do anything with data, it's just for those who don't want to design their own interface for handling it.I believe Bootstrap's original vision was to basically allow programmer-types who weren't great at design¹ a way to make their web apps look better and more consistent; also to allow them to create the application and make it easier for designers to come along later and make it into a good design. It bridges the gap between programming and designing.

But it's become a popular framework, and folks like me use it as a foundation for designing websites. It's handy, and prevents having to re-invent the wheel every time. Standards are a great thing. And it's quick and handy.

So what you're seeing with the admin templates is something designed for the programming types, not so much the design types.

_____

¹ Amusement: I was looking back to see if I needed a comma, and it's a great example of where it would have shifted the meaning to something I didn't want. The phrase ""programmer types, who weren't great at design"" asserts that all programmer types are bad at design, whereas the lack of comma asserts precisely what I mean, which is to clarify that I'm discussing only those programmer types who aren't good at design. Self-amusement, yay! :)Admin Template:
is a mix of HTML/CSS/JS code that allows you to quickly build a  CMS for a website (aka back-end).

Example: http://www.html5admin.com

Bootstrap:
basically the same thing as an Admin Template, but more general. It allows to build both the back-end and the front-end parts of a website.

Similar to Bootstrap: http://foundation.zurb.com/

I would not consider an employer who would even consider hiring someone using Dreamweaver. Was this a phone interview from the late 90s/early 2000?I've gone away from Dreamweaver for just about everything except tutorials that work in Dreamweaver. I kinda feel bad about it, as it was the first thing I'd used many macro media moons ago. I took a look at the Adobe exchange thinking I could rev it up a little, but that is a mess.   Is there any hope for Dreamweaver?


 I was hoping CC might offer something CS 6 doesn't so that I could justify the upgrade. 

What is everybody else using? I've been all about Sublime Text with rsync to do my uploading to remote, but I haven't really spent too much time wading through their plugins, either. If I am going to commit the time to choosing a new environment , I'd sure like it to be one that other people use enough to leverage the community for answers and tips. Find a PSD of a 12 column grid framework, import it as an overlaying layer for reference. 

Slice the interface if you must, I personally prototype and build directly with HTML rather than messing with the HTML export feature on Photoshop.

Other than that, it's a pretty straight forward process- depending on how proficient you are with your code, I wouldn't suggest using dreamweaver - Textmate or Sublime editor work really well for me"

They're what changes the layout at 768, 900ish, and 1100ish pixels. You could add new ones for 600 (you'd have to create a new tag to go with it, like xx-small), or just change all the 768s to 600. That'd be the simplest way, though it might have unforeseen consequences for the rest of your site.Using .container-fluid for the container might help out...I'm not sure if it will but it's a start at least. If not, you can try adjusting the breakpoints with a custom build of Bootstrap.

Otherwise you might just have to hard-code the columns in your box."

2014-07-29 02:02:54;"Has anyone made a ""mini"" version of bootstrap?";"http://getbootstrap.com/customize/I think the trouble you'll face is that people use bootstrap for different reasons: different components are needed depending on who you are.  If you have a static page that contains all elements of Bootstrap you'll need, run it through Chrome's auditor: it'll tell you what parts of the CSS are unused.  You can delete those pieces, minify the rest, and have a generally small CSS file.

Keep in mind: once bootstrap has been downloaded by a client, they'll cache the file.  You're not going to hit huge bandwidth constraints by dishing up the full bootstrap CSS file.  When I have larger projects that I want to use bootstrap with I use the sass version. I then just add the components that I need. Usually its just type and grids, then a compile it with my custom styles.Bootstrap has a less version. Just extend it with a new file, combine classes into your own classes, and then build it. Your backend developers then just have to use the class that you created instead of the 3 bootstrap classes.http://flatstrap.org/Hmm, so you prefer having a smaller html file size than having a smaller css file? =| 

My suggestion: use bootstrap sass (or less) and customize the build. If you want pretty classnames, use the @extend.

If you're not using Rails you can try one of the other methods.

If all else fails you can download the archive manually and extract the assets folder to wherever is suitable for your project (can't be more specific than that without more info). Your html `<link>` tag would need to reference the compiled `bootstrap.css` file (might be named something else depending on your build process). `bootstrap.js` for the `<script>` tag.What framework are you using for the ""website"". I guess you are not using Ruby's HTTP classes to respond to http requests.

Usually frameworks are supposed to work with bundler (its a gem). You would have Gemfile in root folder of your project and in it something like:

    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    ruby '2.1.2'
    gem 'rails', '~> 4.1.4'

You would put the `gem ""bootstrap-sass""` in there and run `bundle install` from your command line. That will download and prepare all you need for bootstrap. More configuration is dependent on how you are serving assets."

2014-08-18 14:59:26;Bootstrap 2.32 Modals;"[deleted]JS/AJAX may be your best (only?) solution, if you just want one modal on the page.

Unless I've misunderstood your question, and you're using different triggers for each form, something like this will work:

HTML:

    <div id=""ajax-modal"" class=""modal hide fade"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""myModalLabel"" aria-hidden=""true"">
        <div class=""modal-header"">
            <button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-hidden=""true"">×</button>
            <h3 id=""myModalLabel"">Modal header</h3>
        </div>
        <div class=""modal-body"" id=""ajax-modal-body"">
        </div>
    </div>

    <button id=""ajax-modal-trigger-form-1"" role=""button"" class=""btn"">Open form 1 in modal</button>
    <button id=""ajax-modal-trigger-form-2"" role=""button"" class=""btn"">Open form 2 in modal</button>

The only things to note here is the ID on the body of the modal and the IDs on the buttons.

The JS:

        jQuery(document).ready(function () {
            var container = $('#ajax-modal-body');
    
            $(""#ajax-modal-trigger-form-1"").click(function () {
                  $('#ajax-modal').modal('toggle'); // Toggle the modal
    
                  $.ajax({
                      type: ""GET"",
                      url: 'form1.html', // Get the first form
                      dataType: 'html',
                      success: function (data) {
                          // Dump the data to the modal body
                          container.html(data);
                          // Clear the data var
                          data = null;
                      },
                      async: true
                  });
              }
            );
    
            $(""#ajax-modal-trigger-form-2"").click(function () {
                  $('#ajax-modal').modal('toggle'); // Toggle the modal
    
                  $.ajax({
                      type: ""GET"",
                      url: 'form2.html', // Get the second form
                      dataType: 'html',
                      success: function (data) {
                          // Dump the data to the modal body
                          container.html(data);
                          // Clear the data var
                          data = null;
                      },
                      async: true
                  });
              }
            );
    
        });

This could be tidied up a lot (I've laid the JS out separated to make it clear - this could be done in one function), plus you'd want to clear the form when the modal's closed, however this should be enough to get you started.

Tested on Bootstrap 3, with the code ported to 2, however it should work fine.

2014-10-06 15:42:17;Bootstrap themes like jQuery UI Themeroller;"When you say themes, do you mean just a different color scheme or templates?

Either way the answer is a soft no with a little yes. They have the inverse classes that can be useful if you want a dark color scheme and they have templates for some of their features. Beyond that it is all third party or their do-it-yourself customizer.
There's only the bootstrap theme that is included in the zip release.   
Example: http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/

The developers want people to create their own theme and is part of the reasoning why 3 is much less styled than 2.There arent really any ""Bootstrap"" official themes unfortunately.
Its really easy to create your own theme though.

There are plenty of tools out there that let you create your own themes though. One of those developed by me :)

2014-10-20 15:40:32;Does every .row need to be inside a separate .container?;"No. you can have as many .row in one container as you want.Diagrams help explain .container and .row

http://www.helloerik.com/the-subtle-magic-behind-why-the-bootstrap-3-grid-works
A container just specifies a width for the content on your page at different screen sizes. So on a large screen the content is 1140px, a small screen 940px etc.

Containers have internal padding on the right and left sides of 15px, so any content in the container will be 15px away from the (invisible) border on the right and left side.

All a row does is set the padding to -15px, which effectively removes the padding of the container. 

So to answer your question, you can have more than one row in a container, as long as the rows aren't within each other, because then they will leak outside of the container.

Here is some example code that is acceptable.

    <div class=""container"">
        <div class=""row"">
            <div class=""col-xs-12"">
                Content
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class=""row"">
            <div class=""col-xs-12"">
                Content
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>You do not even necessarily need containers. But no, you do not need separate containers for each row. Rows were meant to be stacked within elementsIt's still okay to have multiple containers though right? Such as one for the navbar at the top, one for the main body, and one for the footer? Or would it be better off having one container and then 3 rows?"

2014-11-09 21:16:34;New to Bootstrap 3, simplicity of 1.1 gone? So convoluted!;"I am working on creating something like this right now at Start Bootstrap. A basic, LESS based boilerplate for Bootstrap.

So I will cover a few things here in order of appearance:

* CDN - A CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. The idea behind a CDN is that they will host files for your website and deliver it to your end users from one of their servers, typically the one closest to the user. So for example, let's say I have a website, and I want to use the bootstrap.css file. If I just upload it to my server using FTP, then it's delivered to the end user by my web host, which might be in New York for example. If I use a CDN, like the one at http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/, then the CDN will deliver the CSS file to the user. The CDN might have servers with a copy of that same file all around the world - so if someone hits my site in India, and the CDN has a server in Germany for instance, then the server in Germany will deliver the file to them which will probably be a little faster than if it was coming from New York! With a little CSS file like bootstrap.css it doesn't make TOO much of a difference, but if you have lots of content on your site like images, downloads, etc. then a CDN might be worth paying for. All in all though, if you're just starting out with Bootstrap, you don't need to use a CDN. If you want to, you can just use the Bootstrap core CSS and go from there. Long story short, a CDN delivers content to your end users based on where they are, and you don't have to worry about what a CDN is if you don't want to!
* Node, Grunt, and Bower - These are all tools that are commonly used to install and manage components for making website. Bower is a 'package manager' for the web. What it does is it automatically installs files on your computer when you tell it to do something. If I had Bower installed, I could open up my console and type in something like 'bower install bootstrap' and it would install Bootstrap into whatever file I was running my console in. The files would go into a folder called bower_components. I could then reference those files in my HTML, or use something else, to get those onto my page. I could update Bootstrap on my website just by entering 'bower update bootstrap' and it would update it for me, instead of having to go onto their site and download everything, pick out what I want, and stick it in my folders in the right place. Grunt is a JavaScript task runner - in essence it automates a lot of things for you. The reason they use Grunt is because it can automatically compile LESS files into CSS for you! That being said, if you just wanted to download Bootstrap's LESS files and use your own LESS compiler (something like WinLess or Crunch) then you wouldn't need to use Grunt - it's just an option. You can also run less.js on your web page to compile the LESS in the browser, but it's usually better to compile it on your end first, and just serve up CSS to your users.

All in all, if you want to use Bootstrap in it's pure, simple form just use the bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js files along with jQuery. You can see tons of examples of this happening at Start Bootstrap (my site) which has a lot of free templates and themes for Bootstrap. There are a few themes there that use LESS files, but I don't include any sort of compiling method with the files since there are so many ways to do it. If you want a simple example of Bootstrap and  LESS in action, check out this theme - http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/ - it's free to download. When you unzip it, you'll notice that there is a LESS folder. You could delete it and it wouldn't change anything with the page, it's just there as a resource for people who want to use it. If you did want to use the LESS file, you could download a program like WinLess, and use that to compile the LESS into CSS kind of like Grunt does.

Node.js is what things like Grunt and Bower run on, so it's something you need to install before the other two.

This got pretty long winded, but hopefully I cleared up a thing or two. Feel free to respond if you have other questions.

Lastly, here is a quick guide explaining what the hell Grunt is and what it's used for: http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/

Hopefully this helps!Short explanation: Less needs to be compiled to CSS to run in the browser. Your options are:

1. To use the precompiled Bootstrap CSS (either serving it yourself or linking to something like [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)). Easy to set up, but gives you less flexibility (though you can do some customization [here](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) if you plan to serve it yourself). Any other custom CSS can go in a second stylesheet.
2. To use uncompiled Bootstrap Less and compile it to CSS. This gives you more flexibility for customization in a clean way, but requires you to do that compilation step somehow. That's why a `Gruntfile` is included, which instructs Grunt on how to do this properly. In actual fact you could probably just compile it using [the Less compiler alone](http://lesscss.org/#using-less), but it's no easier than using Grunt. Either way you'll need to install Node/npm, there's really no way around that unless you want [a GUI application](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to do it (don't worry there's others that are free and for Windows, CodeKit just seems to be popular). If you really must have the browser do everything for you, [see here](http://lesscss.org/#client-side-usage).

If you're really lazy just copy/paste this into an HTML document as a starting point (loads Bootstrap from CDN):

You can just add these class names to the row and columns where you want no gutter and you'll be done.

I never use people's templates so I'm not aware if someone has done what you are looking for. Also it'll look like native iOS, OR android. It would be tough to make it native on both at the same time. Also look for a script called fastclick.js by default mobile browsers add a 30ms delay on clicking because you might be double tapping to zoom in. That script removes it and makes it feel less laggy and more like a native app.I'd suggest against doing this for a couple of reasons.

First off, 2 separate designs means a lot more work in both the development of the app and maintenance. Secondly, you'll have to either recreate the expected functionality (animations, touch area sizes, etc) of the ""native"" environment inside of your app, because having it look like iOS but behave like something else is a bad user experience."

Let me touch on something else, though. Any developer worth their salt will have tools and components that they likely already know and use. If you're non-tech, leave some choices to the developer and don't try to dictate every single choice they make. Developing to someone else's spec often leads to problems when they try to make too many choices.

By all means, if you have preferences such as bootstrap, mention that when you're hiring the person. Creating an app is not as simple as just finding components and having a developer 'piece it together'. Development isn't some magic process, it takes a lot of problem solving, decision making, and good ol' hard work to develop stuff. Good luck!

TL;DR Let the developer choose which components best fit.I have found these useful before:

As far as I can tell, if you change the class ""navmenu-fixed-left"" on the div to ""navmenu-fixed-right"" then it moves the menu to the other side.  Off the top of my head I can't see how to move the menu button across, but it's standard functionality for that to be on the right of the top nav anyway so can't imagine it will be too difficult to change.

Hope that helps."

If you google ""php email form"" or something similar, there are a TON of templates. As for integrating it into your bootstrap project, you'll just need to add the script to your contact page, save as .php instead of .html and you should be good to go. 

There's also script that has to be written in order for your submit button to properly function as well. Again, though, a quick google search for ""send form information to email html etc etc"" will bring up tons of examples and templates. 

Hope this was helpful!What exactly do you know ?
What is it for ?So, Bootstrap is sort of a way for people writing web applications to make it easier to make the web apps look decent. A lot of people are using it as sort of a templating system - myself included - but perhaps what you're looking for is something easier.

One thing you might consider would be an installation of Wordpress with a plugin like Contact Form 7.

I'm not dumbing anything down, mind. I actually use Bootstrap for some projects, and Wordpress for others. Just depends on the client's needs.

If you go with Bootstrap, you'll be learning HTML a long with the way the Bootstrap framework works. Then you'll have to find a good contact form snippet. Then know enough PHP (or Javascript, but probably PHP) to make the code work how you want  it to.

If you go with Wordpress, you'll have to install it (which is not that hard), then install Contact Form 7 (trivially easy), then get the form set up how you like (much easier than coding a form)."

Then move your opening and closing .row div tags outside the while loop. You only need one row to contain all the columns; they'll stack and wrap appropriately.lockdoubt nailed the problem.

Additionally, here's some extra advice:

Separate your content from your presentation - What that means is don't have your database logic in with your html. Abstract it out into a separate file that you can simply include and then reference as normal.

Alongside that, you don't need all those print statements. You can open and close PHP easily and have html outside of the PHP. In fact, this is ideal.

As to dynamically setting your spans based on the amount of records you intend to show, you can just do a simple division on the number of results. if($count % 2) { $colClass = 3; } else { $colClass = 6; }

You might like to check out [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com), it's an easy PHP framework to learn, and there are some neat projects made with it, in particular, [Bonfire](http://www.cibonfire.com).

They are certainly not the best or newest frameworks for PHP out there, but they are fairly easy to learn, and fun to use. I think you'll appreciate what an ORM can do for you.

(ORM is Object Relational Mapping) CodeIgniter has some database abstraction included, and Bonfire does as well.

It's a bit like this: $this->db->find($id); will return a record with a specific ID, findAll() will return all records, insert() will let you create one, update() and delete() are pretty self explanatory.

Good luck with your learning! I hope that you have fun (coding should be fun) and success in your endeavors."

You can customize the copy of bootstrap you use here : http://getbootstrap.com/customize/

Don't think I can short answer the 'why'. It's the most common use as a base for the design/style of sites. 
Use Sass or Less, start every project with the bootstrap.scss file commenting everything out except for the imports you need. Opt in to the things you need from bootstrap rather than the other way around. Just spitballing, I haven't done this, but you could use LESS/SCSS to import all of bootstrap under a single selector and then build it yourself, something like

If you want to tweak bootstrap within your project (as opposed to some web editor), get Gulp and configure gulp-less (Grunt can do this just as easily) to compile the LESS version of bootstrap into your final bootstrap.css.

I like to tone down corner rounding and for lots of projects, change the entire pallete.  Editing the LESS files directly is the best way to accomplish this and you gain a better understanding of how bootstrap is put together.

Also, it's fantastic for extending bootstrap.  Just add your own LESS file and add it to the master list of includes.

When I'm done editing the LESS I just run ""gulp less"" which I have setup to compile my bootstrap.css to the spot I want.  You can also setup a file watcher with gulp that will perform this compilation whenever your LESS files change.From the sticked post above:

That was about 6 months ago, and they mentioned that they wanted to release 4 in the ""coming months"" along with a series of updates to version 3.

If you look at the milestones on the GitHub project there is a set of goals for the 3.3.5 release, but I have a feeling that 3.3.5 might be the last release before Bootstrap 4 unless there are some smaller issues/tweaks that need to happen in a 3.3.6 or 3.3.7 release.

I like brackets and sublime text, but use what you like. 

Out of curiosity, what do you find clunky about brackets?Does anyone know any good How To Bracket videos?Honestly, if you're looking for simplicity then Visual Studio may be overdoing it a tad. Try something like Notepad++ (free) or Sublime Text ($60, I think, but well worth it).

If you pick up either of these editors, then be sure to download the Emmet (AKA ZenCoding) extension. It allows you to insert a bunch of HTML tags with nesting, attributes, classes, etc. extremely quickly.

Example. If you type this in Emmet:

    div.row>div.col-xs-12.col-sm-12.col-md-9.col-lg-9#banner

and hit TAB (or whatever key you have bound to it), it'll spit out this:

    <div class=""row"">

It also left aligns and makes the elements inline-block. If you are viewing anything under 768px size some of that may not totally apply.

MIND YOU, Linking to JQuery's .min.js is what will work. I don't know why but the is the solution that worked for me.   
For further clarification, the code is below.

    <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js'></script>

Codeschool's first bootstrap course is free and very informative. Other than that, read the bootstrap documentation. It's very easy to read and very insightful.Bootstrap _is_ CSS, so without some understanding of it, you won't know how to use Bootstrap.

That said, the [getting started](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples) section of the Bootstrap site has templates that you can build on.I picked it up pretty quick with [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/). As soon as you understand their syntax, it's a breeze. I also recommend their templates, even if you just copy-paste them. By fiddling around, you get a sense of how Bootstrap works.The examples on the website and everything under ""components"" is what I started with.  Quite handyW3Schools and the official website are great for quick reference Here.

2015-05-29 12:39:33;[Help] adding password to site;"[deleted]/u/babylion's suggestion is great if you're happy (and able) to use PHP. Another option I've seen done a few times, that requires nothing more than HTML and Javascript, is to have a form that, when filled with a password, hashes the password (plus a salt) then makes an XMLHttpRequest for the page whose filename is that salt. E.g. if the salt was ""hello"" and the password entered was ""swordfish"", then md5('swordfishhello') = b767a8d0c6dfb5068b34b878e7c09f57 so it'd look for e.g. b767a8d0c6dfb5068b34b878e7c09f57.html. If it gets a 404 back, it says ""wrong password"". If it gets anything else, it redirects (window.location=) to the secret page.

This way, all you have to do is keep the URL secret (a good start might be keeping it in a subdirectory that's listed in your robots.txt - obviously don't list the page itself!).

Again: you're better using a server-side solution such as /u/babylion's PHP example, Apache .htaccess+htpasswd, server configuration in other server software, or another server-side language that you might have available (Perl, ASP, Python, whatever). But my solution, proposed above (while less-elegant), will ""just work"", requires no server-side work, and can be hosted *anywhere*.

Give me a shout if you want a code example.You can edit your .htaccess file to do this. Have a search for htaccess password protect.Thanks for the reply.

            <div class=""col-sm-7"">

                [image] 
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

Or if you really need the structure around the images then:

    <div class=""container"">
        <div class=""row"">
            <div class=""col-sm-7"">
             [image]

If so, make sure those are the css files you have referenced on your page/pages. Also are your site styles declared after the bootstrap styles?

2015-06-24 15:25:17;When do I use the .row class?;"This is a must-read: http://www.helloerik.com/the-subtle-magic-behind-why-the-bootstrap-3-grid-worksAs the Bootstrap docs state ""Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns"".. and, ""If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line"".

So in your example with `col-xs-12` it really won't make a difference since you're using the full 12 units per row. But, in a scenaro where you're using small columns in each row (ie; 2, 3 or 4 cols per row) the new `row` would force a horizontal break. This break may not be desirable if you're trying to achieve a different layout on different viewports (hello responsive design ;-)).

For example, consider a layout where you want 2 columns across on large screens, and 3 columns across on smaller screens.
If you use the separate `row` every 12 units you'll get an unwanted break on small screens. If you use a single `row` container it will work for whatever number of columns you have:

Demo: http://codeply.com/view/UWHW8KPpVO?viewport=xs

Also, not having to insert a new `row` every nth column is easier when iterating dynamic data where the number of items can be an unknown.

.row does two things:

1. clear fixes the child columns so they can be varying widths and lengths without messing up the rest of the page layout.
2. offsets the outside gutters on the first and last column. Creates a negative margin to ""absorb"" the column padding so everything lines up and can be nested.

EDIT: full width content is better wrapped in <div class=""clearfix"">..</div>.  
.row is only needed if you need >2  columns for any break point.

The row class is there to facilitate a grid via the col classes.  Keep in mind that you should not nest a col inside of a col.  You can, however, nest rows inside of cols:

    <div class=""row""> 
      <div class=""col-xs-12"">
        <div class=""row"">
          <div class=""col-xs-2""></div>
          <div class=""col-xs-5""></div>
          <div class=""col-xs-5""></div>
This means that you could just have one row to contain the whole thing and then breakup the large pieces using cols and then build smaller grids inside each of the cols with the row > col as above."

You're opening an HTML bracket inside a bracket that hasn't been closed yet. 

Also I always have issues when I put containers inside rows. Try using the container class to house the row and columns. The container is meant to hold things together, hence ""container"".  

Such as:

    <div class=""container"">
        <div class=""row"">
            <div class=""col-lg-6"">Left Side</div>

So the question is, are you willing to put in the time to get to a point where you can copy paste the HTML bits you want and are knowledgeable enough to find the CSS that belongs to it. 

And maybe do some adapting if necessary.

If you have any aspirations to become somewhat literate in HTML and CSS this would be an excellent exercise. If you don't it's definitely more work then it will bring you for just one site and get someone else to do it for you.

Good luck!"

http://bootstrapbay.com/blog/category/tutorials/Try [Brad Hussey](https://www.youtube.com/user/hussey17).

And please, stay away from w3schools.com. For basics, for HTML5 & CSS3 or Javascript reference, use [htmldog.com](http://htmldog.com)

And by all means, create something. Plan a layout and start writing code. Let the website(or app or whatever you're working on) in creation teach you things.Lynda.com has some good onesWell, I don't have any specific link to help you so sorry about that. I highly recommend [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/search/?searchTerm=bootstrap) it's a great resource for web design/developement in general. You could try it out for a month at $29.00. However if you don't want to spend money I suggest you go to Youtube.


Edit: I was browsing /r/web_design and saw this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/3d2sxi/every_modern_website_practicing_neater_styling/?ref=share&ref_source=link) and thought that maybe you could try to do something similar using bootstrap from scratch as a way of getting to know it. Just build a site like the one linked in the post, don't worry about the content just do the general layout. It should be really easy using Bootstrap and it will help you understand it.

You could use the official Bootstrap [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) to get started.I've found some good ones on YouTube.why videos?  the [w3schools tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp) were easy and interactive, and was all it took to get me started."

To make the jumbotron full width, and without rounded corners, place it outside all .containers and instead add a .container within.

If they can't, tell your IT department that it isn't 2009 any more.

Honestly, what you have tried does work for me, to some extent. Make sure the js files are loading properly.I too support ie8 but I build a separate version of Bootstrap.css with a fixed container width of 1000px.  I also use guarded mixins to swap ie8 and other styles to reduce hacks and overrides. The css weight is reduced by 20 to 30 Kb and respond.js is no longer needed.  


Ie8 usually has poor performance for a number of factors.  Best to trim the payload as much as possible. Servers can reliably detect <ie9 to make the swap before the page is sent. There is just too much wrong with ie8 styling to do this the 'good' way and have a reasonable page load time. 

EDIT: If sales are involved, the cost of developing this is easily paid by the increased margins. "

If your use of panels, wells, and anything discontinued is absolutely needed, then you can either stick with Bootstrap 3, and manually copy over any styles you still need from 3 into 4. 

Otherwise, if you can switch completely over to 4, I suggest you wait until its actually released before making any major changes due to the fact it still is indeed an alpha. Maybe redesign it on the side using cards, and see how much it changes over coming months. [deleted]

2015-09-15 22:39:35;Bootstrap 4 Full Release???;"Quoted from [the Bootstrap 4 Alpha announcement](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/) last month:

    The general development and release plan looks something like this:

    A few alpha releases while things are still in flux.
    Two beta releases after features and functionality are locked down to really test things out.
    Two release candidates (RCs) to really test things out closer to production environments.
    Then, the final release!

So... A while, it would seem.Not this yearBootstrap isn't known for their rapid release schedule, or for keeping developers informed when releases will happen. Plus there is always a risk in depending on alpha code.   

They are planning a few alpha releases while they iron what will be included. Then two beta releases. I would wait until it is feature stable and in beta before considering it for production projects.IMO I would say just stick with the latest Bootstrap 3 to update your website with. If the announcement for BS4 wasn't made would you still have doubts or not want to use Bootstrap 3? Probably not. It's still very good.

Like other's have pointed out it's still a ways away from GA (General Availability)."
2015-09-15 20:24:24;What are the css for the container div class?;"Look it up in the bootstrap codeImo, it'd be hard to separate css code from the bootstrap framework. :)

What is it you want? Is it just normal container, fluid or? 


The normal container box doesnt seem hard to replicate The container is literally just what is sounds like  - a container. 

It sets the width content is at different screensizes and it has margins/padding. As such it's really easy to replicate.

All you need to specify are the widths, the margins, the padding.

If that's too much  for you, here it is:

    .container {
      margin-right: auto;
      margin-left: auto;
      padding-left: 15px;
      padding-right: 15px;
    }
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      .container {
        width: 750px;
      }
    }
    @media (min-width: 992px) {
      .container {
        width: 970px;
      }
    }
    @media (min-width: 1200px) {
      .container {
        width: 1170px;
      }
    }    

All you  need to do to find it is search for "".container"" in the Bootstrap css file."
2015-09-15 14:33:24;How do you guys remember the many Bootstrap classes and their order?;"Copy and paste. 

Stuff I use often like grids, buttons, panels I remember. The rest I just look up in the documentation. Navbars are probably the hardest. They require proper nesting so I just copy and paste the relevant snippet and tweak it until I have what I need. I mean, that's kinda what the documentation is for.Like /u/com_kieffer says, copying and pasting. Is there any reason not to? There's no need to try and remember these classes since that doesn't really serve a purpose. It does help though, to know when a class is out of place (i.e., used in the wrong spot.)I've spent a while working in bootstrap now, and I literally just keep the bootstrap documentation open for reference.  Certain things I start to memorize because I've done them over and over, but others, like the nav, I've done maybe a 3 times ever so there's no point in memorizing it.  Try Codeply: http://www.codeply.com/go - The elements/classes are built into the editor menus, and you can just click the ""Bootstrap x.x.x"" to get to the docs. Yeah, copy and paste. 

More specifically, I tend to copy what I've done before when setting up a new page. Should probably save one as a template, actually.Nobody memorizes this code. You just learn to understand it and copy from the documentation or an earlier project when the need arrises. For the stuff like the navbar I copy and paste it from the latest example. Unless there is a large amount of items in the navbar then I have PHP create it using an array.

If I can automate anything with PHP I will. I mainly do it with image galleries, that way I only have to write one line of php instead 36 lines of:

    <a data-rel=""Image Desc"" class=""box-troll inline preload swipebox"" href=""thumb/x768/src/img/src.jpg"" title=""Image Desc"" data-href=""img/src.jpg"">
    <img src=""thumb/x64/src/img/src.jpg"" class=""img-responsive img-thumb animated flipInX"" alt=""Image Desc"">
    </a>

I really need to start naming my custom classes relative to their jobs.I keep the components page up and then intellisense in visual studio does the rest for me. I learn the different features of Bootstrap and their uses. Simple things like grid layouts and styling classes are memorized. I use Sublime Text with a Bootstrap 3 package where I can inject the necessary code snippet for stuff like navigation, models, etc. makes it easier than finding the code snippets."

But, on mobile you probably want the columns to stack and have each one be the full width of the phone. So change col-xs-4 to something like col-md-4. This means that for all screen sizes md and up, the columns will be 4 wide, for any screen sizes less, they will full width and stack on top of each other.

For the YouTube video, look up responsive embeds on Bootstraps website.Bootstrap is actually mobile first meaning the bulk of the code is written for mobile then @media queries create different layouts at bigger sizes.

2015-10-13 16:12:28;Trouble understanding nested columns and rows.;"The ""current code"" links to just the starter template.

It sounds like you've got two major issues you have to deal with:

#Centering vertically.

That is really tough to do without going into <table>s or {display:table-cell;}.  Your best option would be to define a div with a custom class like this:

    div.title{
        background-color:grey;
        font-size: 20px;
        padding-top: 10px;
        padding-bottom: 10px;
    }

This should give you a good idea of where to go.  If you want to go even fancier, you can make it:

    position:absolute;
    bottom:0;
    left:0;
    right:0;

This will guarantee it's at the bottom of your parent div, and be snug against each side.  Be sure to make the parent div have `position:relative;` in the css.  

#Fixed Size

Bootstrap is not designed for ""Fixed sizes"".  Bootstrap is designed to have the positions change depending on the screen size.  That's what the `.col-md-N` and `.col-sm-N` &tc. classes are for.  

What I would suggest is have a ""parent"" div that contains the image you want, and the `div.title` inside it.  That parent div will have a fixed height (or dynamic height, if you want to jump right in to @media queries), and the width will adjust as you adjust the screen size.  

One gotcha: Make sure that this parent div, and any div with formatting is INSIDE a `.col-xx-N` div.  Try not to put formatting on the `.col-xx-N` and `.row` divs, as that might mess up your formatting as the window shrinks.  A simple trick that will work if you are dealing with divs with text only is to give a fixed height to the div and make the line-height the same value"

Edit: this horizontally centers things. Offhand I can't remember how to vertically center things. Something to do with displaying divs as table cells, I believe.

2015-10-27 11:16:43;I'm at a basic level of coding and starting to learn bootstrap, so I would like to ask a couple questions.;"1) The layout scaffolding alone is an excellent reason to use Bootstrap for desktop-only web pages.

2) Bootstrap allows you to download the LESS (still I hope) source code that compiles into CSS.  You can make changes to the variables/parameters and recompile.  Alternatively, you can override the Bootstrap CSS where needed to get the effect you desire.  Just create a new CSS file, include it AFTER the Bootstrap CSS files in your markup, and create new rules based on what you find in the inspector.  I prefer to recompile from source because then you can apply high-level things like default gutter size and colors, but I've used overrides in prodction sites no problem.The bootstrap idea is that your website ports over to all devices. 1) You can build a simple website with Bootstrap. The whole mobile thing is that its made in a way that you can easily view a website in your cellphone, that's pretty much it. (ofc its not that easy, but its the tl;dr)  
  
2) This is a bad way but use Style, or then again create your own CSS class. You can view all the stuff in inspect, I hope you're using Chrome or FF. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnWL2d9bGPkYou  *can* use !important to override what you feel you need to, but Bootstrap is fairly flexible when you keep within its framework. 

My team and I are finishing up a major overhaul of our companies intranet site built on SharePoint and heavily utilizing Bootstrap.  It has taken awhile, but we have actually counted the times we have had to use an !important designation : 3 instances over all the solutions developed for the project (50+ custom web parts, 10+ custom page layouts, 4 custom master pages).  Our graphic designer is a stickler for alignment as well.

tl;dr: you might not need to override bootstrap if you become comfortable with hierarchy: container(-fluid) > row > col-(xs)-#.
Remember, the column sizes inherit upwards (xs = xs + sm + md + lg ; md = md + lg)

For element id, i have been using a chrome extension called 'Pesticide' that has been very helpful. "

I have a feeling it will not work, but you can try it anyways.
* Percentage are calculated according to the [width of the object](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#margin-properties) so they will automatically adjust for different container widths.   
* If this doesn't  give you the desired appearance, use ems and media queries to adjust the spacing at different breakpoints
* use margin-bottom to avoid issues with [collapsing margins](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins)
* consider creating classes like .margin-bottom-lg so you can add the margin only when you need itOffset your column. <div class=""span3 offset2"">...</div> that example takes up five of the 12 columns as an offset counts as a column.Just realised you said rows.  Derp! Easiest way is to create a new class and add it to your css. Also apply it to bottom of row as top has more issues. Try: . bottom-mymargin { margin-bottom:20%; } and then in html <div class=""row bottom-mymargin"">...  Mymargin can be called anything. You can then create say mymargin-small or -medium etc to make it easier"

the cutoffs for md @970px and lg @1170px in Bootstrap v. 3 (I think these were different in v.2)
First off, all col groups have a horizontal layout. Col.xs isn't valid CSS  so technically it doesn't go horizontal -  was this a trick question?

The default layout for all cols is stacked until they match a given media query viewport width. The xs classes are defined outside a media query so they are horizontal (ie active) immediately and for all widths. 

 Col-sm is active from 769px up, col-md is active from 993px up and col-lg is active from 1200px up. "

2015-12-09 19:40:11;Question about how to achieve a dynamic scaling Bootstrap grid system (Newbie here);"This is what your code is saying: ""From size xs up, we want to have something that is at most 8/12 wide, and offset by 2/12.""

Unfortunately, offsetting by 2/12 at large sizes doesn't appear centered. This is because your nav doesn't scale with the size of your site. It's always the same width. If your goal is to have something appear roughly centered at all screen sizes, try this:

    <div class=""col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 col-md-offset-3 col-lg-offset-4"">

Basically, this will move the content over a bit more at large sizes and less at smaller sizes, hopefully resulting in approximately centered content. 

If you need to move over things more at larger sizes, you will probably need to add `col-lg-6` or `col-md-7`, as well (I am just guessing at the numbers). First of all, you need to add a container which wraps around the div class=""row""

In bootstrap, you always need a container or container-fluid, inside which is a row, inside which are your columns.

In this instance, not having a container means there is no set width for your content, it will also mean there will be no space between the edge of xs screens and your content.Your best bet (How I do it) is to put in three columns, have one col for size 2, then your main content under a size 8, then another col for size 2 after this (So you end up with a 2-8-2 structure). Do this for each row (Say you have more content underneath). Obviously if you want two divs to sit next to each other, split the 8 column into two 4 columns, and so on.

Good luck!"

2015-12-07 22:39:35;How does a Bootstrap theme differ from a UI Kit?;"Ui kits, AFAIK, are typically Photoshop elements. As in, here's a picture of a form element for you to turn into a usable component. 

A CSS framework like bootstrap changes the appearance of the actual HTML element.  

That's my take. Never used the former, used the latter plenty often. I make Bootstrap themes (http://hackerthemes.com if I'm allowed this self-plug :-)

I can't say much about UI kits, but there's two different things that are called a ""theme"", which is a bit confusing:

- Themes that simply give all bootstrap elements a new look. This is just a CSS file which you use instead of the original and then your bootstrap site has a new feel. I like to refer to this as skin rather than theme, but that's just me. See https://bootswatch.com/ for some examples.

- Themes that are basically HTML (or even Wordpress) websites *built with* Bootstrap. They may also restyle some or all components of Bootstrap to adapt to the specific design, but they also include new elements and generally come with a complete design and some page layouts (i.e. blog, front page, about us page, etc.) They include HTML files as well as CSS, LESS or SASS and JavaScript. See http://wrapbootstrap.com and my website above for examples.

Probably the easiest for you will be to include a ""theme"" style sheet that lives in addition to the normal Bootstrap stuff. You could also directly update the standard code but I wouldn't suggest it.

Bootstrap doesn't include functionality for calendars but there are plenty of plugins to accommodate that (even a few built with BS in mind). Thematically you should just start broadly and work your way down to specific elements. Things like rounded corners you can square off broadly, followed by type treatment and colors. Items like the scroll bar in the drop down are kind of a throw back to the old JS driven select menus. That being said JS could do that. Though it would be determined also based on if those are actually selects or divs that are scollable. Long story short - JS will do it. But you should suggest losing the scrollbar. It also doesn't necessarily make sense in a mobile world. "

Well bootstrap has a ton of premade components. When you get good with CSS most of them are quite easy to replicate quickly but why reinvent the wheel?

Try copy and paste that code and you'll see that the two pieces of text are side by side occupying 50% width each. Then resize your browser to the size of a phone screen and you'll see that the pieces of text are now above and below each other. That's because you're now using the bootstrap grid

The container div sets a max width content can be so that it won't hit the edge of the browser, the row div needs to be inside the container so that when you have columns the padding is right (don't worry about that now) then the two divs with col-xs-12 col-sm-6 are saying at screen size ""xs"" this div should be 12 grid units wide (the grid is only 12 wide in total so this is 100% width)

The col-sm-6 means at screen size ""sm"" and above the div should be 6 units wide (which is 6/12 so 50%)

There are four different sizes you can use - xs, sm, md, lg

So if you have

    <div class=""col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-5 col-lg-4"">

That div will be 12/12 units wide on xs screens (100%), 8/12 units on sm (66%), 5/12 units on md (42%), and 4/12 units on lg screens (33%)

So just by adding classes to HTML elements you can change their size on any screen size and therefore have a responsive website

That's why on your browser the content statements are next to each other but then above and below on the small browser size. That's the basics of the grid!! Using these same principles you can now build fully responsive sites without worrying about the CSS widths.

If you want to know more feel free to ask
            Basically when you want to use the bootstrap CSS and Javascript (JS) files you have to link to them in your HTML file. After you download Bootstrap from http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download . This can be done with an easy bit of code:

For CSS: 
<!-- Bootstrap -->
<link href=""css/bootstrap.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

For JS: 
<!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
<script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js""></script>
<!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed -->
<script src=""js/bootstrap.min.js""></script>

The JS is important if you want to use some functions of Bootstrap. Like buttons that light up when you hover over them. 

Once you have done this you can begin and play with the functions to learn. 
Instructions and examples can be found here: 
http://getbootstrap.com/components/
http://getbootstrap.com/css/I just asked the same question above and it troubled me for a while. I really don't understand why Bootstrap doesn't include a proper starting HTML including all the template'ish HTML code (linked CSS, JS, head, title, doctype, etc).I would recommend using a CDN to load Bootstrap and Jquery; it forces you to adopt best practice of using a custom css file to make your changes outside of the standard Bootstrap theme as opposed to manually modifying the bootstrap file. Bootstrap and Jquery both have CDN links / code on their website with HTML code on the download page. 

First professional product I worked on made this mistake and now upgrading Bootstrap is not going to happen unless necessary due to the added difficulty of not having the custom CSS separated. "
2015-12-22 06:03:23;Having trouble understanding the grid/column/row aspect of Bootstrap.;"the container is basically a big wrapper which holds your content. For example, if you'd like to have white space on the left and right side of your page add a .container class to your element.

If you want an element to be the full width of the browser add a .container-fluid class to it.

The container is just a big holder element which holds the website content elements inside. 

as you mentioned, the columns must always add to 12.
if you have 2 elements, and give them both the class col-lg-6. 

Than this means that those columns (col) on large screen sizes (lg) will be 6 columns big (6)

now let's say on mobile screens you'd like these columns to fill out the entire width. You will have to give them a xs col class. 

col-xs-12:  columns fill out 12 on xs (mobile) screen sizes.

a row is basically what the name says, whenever elements need to be beside eachother, place them in the same row.

If elements are need to be placed underneath the others (lets say they are a different part of your website) then make a new .row class.



1. Website goes into container or container fluid (depending on full width or max-width) this can be combined, (full width header image, max-width content).  

2. Inside container we place rows depending on if an element needs to be placed underneath the last element you added.

3.  Inside rows we add our columns which we define with col-lg-12, col-md-12, col-sm-12, col-xs-12, the 12 depends on how many columns you want it to fill out on what screen size. Make sure you always fill out 12 columns.

4. Inside your columns add your content.http://shoelace.io/ made it all click together for me.

I had to pick up Bootstrap for a new job and had the hardest time grasping the concept of the grid system.

2015-12-18 04:40:47;"How can I determine which navbar element to be the ""active"" class dynamically?";"Not a PHP dev, but the logic should be similar:

The current page has an ID or some other unique identifier. 

Every item being rendered in the menu also has an identifier. 

When you build out the menu, just compare the identifier of the current page with the menu node being rendered. 

If they match, add the active class. Here's a PHP script that will do it for you
    
    <?php
        function isActive($requestUri) {
            $current_file_name = basename($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "".php"");
            if ($current_file_name == $requestUri)
            echo 'class=""active""';
        }
    ?>
    

Then all you need to do is insert this:

    <?=isActive(""page-url"")?>

in your nav list like this:

    <li <?=isActive(""contact"")?>>
        <a href=""contact"">Contact</a>
    </li>

When the url ends with /contact that script will insert class=""active"" in the <li>. This is done server side so the page will render with the active class on it, users will never see any flashing. 

**Note** This will only work on pages that end with .php, not .html"

They also import the Bootstrap variables & mixins so they are a available to use: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/docs/assets/scss/docs.scss

This is the approach I normally use if I'm developing themes because that makes it easier for customers to update minor versions of Bootstrap themselves. We used to just alter the Bootstrap variables file but I had a lot of customers complain as it made updates harder for them. 



> I want to avoid touching any files in Bootstrap... 

Herein lies the biggest issue I have with Bootstrap: people treat the source code like a sacred cow never to be touched, always to be overridden.  Additional custom classes to address your needs on top of the default is just bloat. 

My advice - change the source to match your needs.

2016-01-16 23:33:41;Appropriate usage of column/viewport sizing?;" >bootstrap will fall back to the smaller view port classes if nothing is declared for the current view

You can think of it like that sure, but that's a bit misguided.  The col-xs/sm/md/lg classes don't actually ""fall back""; rather, wider grid classes take precedence over (i.e. overwrites the width of) the narrower grid classes.  Hence, something like `col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6` is the same as just `col-sm-6`, for everything 768px and wider.

If col-sm/md/lg prefix is used and there is no narrower class added, then the width property is simply removed whenever it enters a viewport narrower than it.  It would be like as if the width was never assigned for that element.

In your specific case, by doing `col-md-offset-1` and no narrower class, that's saying ""for everything 992px and wider, add an offset; else, remove the offset"".  If you need the offset for smaller viewports, you will need to use a narrower prefix, e.g. `col-xs-offset-1` if you want it for all viewport sizes or`col-sm-offset-1` if you want it for all viewport sizes wider than 768px.

It might also be helpful for you to review the [grid documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) again as well and see the examples.

Since you're using Bootstrap you can also use ""ems"" or em next to any text you use (1 em = 14px from the asterisk in your CSS. And then 2 em for 28px.  .5em for 7px). Ems are used for responsive web design and help with scaling.

    <?php include(""header.php"") ?>
    <?php include(""content.php"") ?>	
    <?php include(""footer.php"") ?>

    <?php include_once('functions/paths.php'); ?>

So what is the functions file?  It allows you to navigate between multiple PHP files that have content on them.  Example being, home.php, about.php, portfolio.php, contact.php, etc.

My functions file usually looks like this:

    <?php
	$pages_path = 'pages/';
	$default = 'home';
	$page = isset($_GET['MMM']) ? $_GET['MMM'] : $default;
	include_once(""{$pages_path}{$page}.php"");
    ?>

If you notice the path, it's pages/

This means I have a folder called pages and inside that folder resides all my actual PHP files with the content like I mentioned above - about, portfolio, contact, etc.

The rest of the code in the functions file works with what you'll refer to as a .htaccess file.  These can be confusing, but they are inserted in your host at the same place as your index.  What it does is allow the PHP to work in such a way that it only pulls the name and not the extension.

This means instead of something like:

www.MMM.com/about.php

www.MMM.com/portfolio.php

www.MMM.com/contact.php

It will instead look like:

www.MMM.com/about

www.MMM.com/portfolio

Save things like your header and navbar in to separate files like

header.php

navbar.php

Then on every page you want them to appear just write

<?php include('header.php'); ?>

And the same for navbar.

Now you can edit the header once and it'll be changed on all pages!


Are you using any template engine, such as twig?"

2016-02-27 19:31:36;Placing elements with Bootstrap;"Edit: If this is way below you, I apologize in advance.

Can you use tables in bootstrap? Yes.

Should you? meh. Web development has been trending away from tables for quite some time. They are great for data grids.

Bootstrap's big feature is that it allows flexible re-sizing for various browser sizes. It's great for non-commercial applications and commercial applications. It makes using a website on a mobile phone a viable thing. It may even eliminate the need for an app if it works well on mobile.

So I took the image of your page and I wrote it out in bootstrap. Here is the link for [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ksst85rh/18/). I added a little css to paint the div borders white when you hovered over them as well. That was me, not bootstrap :D

[Here is a video of bootstrap in action for the page.](https://gfycat.com/DisfiguredHeavenlyGuillemot)

How to use bootstrap in a nutshell?

**(1) You must include a reference to JQuery, bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap.min.js.**

The following should be between your <head> </head>

    <script src=""//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.0.min.js""></script>
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css"">
    <script src=""https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"" ""></script>

**(2) You still work in rows and columns**

**A <tr> is basically this below**

    <div class=""row"">
**A <td> is basically this below**

    <div class=""col-md-1"">

**(3) What are those things in the div classes?** 

**""col""** means its a column

**""md""** medium size (the [browser size](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-options) is considered medium in resolution) 

**""1""** is the column size it expands.

By default Bootstrap breaks up the screen into 12 parts. 

so if you do

    <div class=""row"">
    	<div class=""col-md-4 col-sm-12"">
    	<div>
    	<div class=""col-md-8 col-sm-12"">
    	<div>
    </div>

You'll get div that contains two divs. 

If the browser window size is greater than 970 the first div will be the width of (100%/12) x **4** = 33% and the second (100%/12) x **8** = 33%

If the browser window size is smaller than 970, the first div will be across the entire width of the screen and the second div will wrap and do the same.

This allows easier viewing on smaller devices. Rather than zooming and scrolling and zooming and scrolling and getting lost. The user can just scroll through the website like they do twitter for facebook.

It's not just all for mobile, it great helps for tablets and even bridges the gap between PC's where the resolution may be 1280x1024 (commercial business user) or an office professional with a 27"" 4k monitor with almost 3 times the resolution (dimensions not pixels).

Anyways, I hope this was enough of a brain dump to get you going. Good luck!

2016-02-27 00:28:13;How do I use a Bootstrap Theme?;"Some of the themes I found do seem to come with an out-of-the-box demo (and an index.html that works); others don't.  I guess I'll start with one that does and reverse engineer from there.

http://freehtml5.co/elate-free-html5-bootstrap-template/You just open up the index.html supplied with the template/theme and edit it to your needs. If none is supplied, you just link the .css AFTER the normal Bootstrap css, just like the ""optional theme"" supplied by Bootstrap.

You then use the PHP/javascript to edit the content inside Spans and Divs and other HTML tags via their class or ID to show the data you want.you can download some of themAnswering my own question.

Templates, as I now understand it, aren't really made for ""skinning"" Bootstrap - though they do that - they're also made to combine a group of other useful tools and widgets.  To implement a template, you need to clone its sample pages, remove the sample code, break it into components, and fill in your own code.

The template that was handed to me, ""Bucket Admin"" from Themeforest, came with extensive sample code, and one long document with some explanation and examples.  EDIT: Also looking into ""Xenon"", which is similar.

Unfortunately, the samples are mixed in with the working code, so I'm having to strip out all the sample pages, css, and js since I will be reimplementing these in my app.  It would be nice if it were clear which were which (for example, by keeping all the template files within a directory, and all the sample files in another directory, or at least all in the root).  It would also be nice if they provided me with an ""empty"" sample, with only the bare minimum of what I needed to get started.

The sample files also are organized as a set of single-file complete html pages.  Headers, footers, menus, other boilerplate isn't separated into included files (it's html, not php, so I understand that).  As a developer, I'll need to break this up into multiple files, since, for example, the menus are re-used throughout my application and should be DRY.

Javascript files are missing header comments, so I have to read into them to determine what they are supposed to be doing and whether they're template or sample.  They're also very sparse on comments in general - more commenting in the sample pages especially would be useful.

//set the display values for the foo-widget here

The documentation is only available if I purchase the theme (which we have), it would be useful to be able to see it before purchasing.

I'm sure some or all of these may be different - for better or worse - in other templates.  Not being open source/github, I can't offer pull requests with improvements, even to the documentation or sample code."

2016-03-09 14:02:35;Placing elements outside of the grid;"There's certainly no requirement to place everything inside of the grid, especially with Bootstrap. 

Take the classic Bootstrap navbar. You don't put the individual nav elements in columns (and the navbar itself is the row). But when you're on mobile, they hide themselves in the hot dog menu. Thus, they're responsive without being in the grid.

That said, you should try to keep main body content ""gridded"" (for lack of a better term) as much as possible so as to make responsiveness *easier*. Hope this helps.Grid != responsive. I could build a fully responsive site without any grid system, and I could also build an entirely non-responsive site using a grid. "

2016-03-14 19:03:44;Changing the breakpoint for the collapse menu in Bootstrap 3... on a single page;"First off, you claim you want the breakpoint at 768px but in the CSS in your post, it is at 798px.  This could very well be a typo that you didn't notice.

Second, if it is just one page and if it is really only 768px, then you can manually apply [Bootstrap's](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities) `.visible-xs-block` and `.hidden-xs` class on the elements for that page to toggle the appearance.  When `.visible-xs-block`is applied, the element will only show up when the viewport is less than 768px; else, it will be hidden when 768px and wider.  When `.hidden-xs` is applied, the element will be hidden when less than 768px, but will appear when 768px and greater.

As a last note, your media queries being at equal widths will cause a side effect where both queries will be applied at that width.  However, because of the cascading nature of CSS, the min-width one will be applied and while it may look like it will be applied correctly, it may lead to undesired effects.  Therefore, you should change one of the widths to be 1px off than the other to ensure there will be in no conflict in styles.This should do it :) -> code
@media (max-width: 798px) {
    
      .navbar-toggle {
        display: block;
    }
   
    .navbar-collapse.collapse {
        display: none!important;
    }
    .navbar-nav {
        float: none!important;
        /*margin: 7.5px -15px;*/
    }
    .navbar-nav>li {
        float: none;
    }
}

Make sure he knows that this incremental approach is making it difficult for you to execute properly, and if you two plan out the stages then that allows you to make sure the piece you're building now will integrate properly with the piece coming in the future.

My brother once told me that the difference between experienced coders and amateur coders is that experiences coders spend 75% of their time planning, while amateurs jump in and start writing code until they have what they want.

Lastly, don't write a custom theme. You can customize a free or premium theme to match your needs and it will be infinitely easier, more secure, and scalable.I'm no pro, but there are WordPress themes designed to tie in with bootstrap. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should, mind you. I would do some googling, mock up something vaguely similar in wp, then present boss with the choice.  Good luck.

2016-04-27 05:11:54;Help Please!? In school now, they taught Bootstrap in one day, now I have a week to build a 12 page site.;"Depends on really if you are interested in it or just want to pass the class.

If you want the easy route, just look up something like [Bootstrap Material Design](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design) (if custom styling frameworks are allowed) or search other bootstrap look and feel overrides, then search for some cool looking bootstrap web site templates.

Pretty common to find portfolio/restaurant looking designs which are unique enough to be interesting.

I suggest starting with ""tutorials"" instead of ""templates""/""themes"" as a lot of the markup and CSS is going to be heavy and will almost be a giveaway you took the easy approach, look for building blocks.

However, if you want, be creative and learn the material, create something new. Find non-traditional layouts that don't just have the traditional top-nav, brand, etc. Use some of the complex features like scrollspy and events.

Good luck.Bootstrap makes it fast to make websites. What you're being asked to do is a couple of hours work. Don't stress.

The bootstrap templates page will get you started with almost any page type you're likely to need. And the documentation itself is filled with examples. There are also plenty of free bootstrap themes, just grab one. This is about as close to a copy and paste exercise as one could wish for.

What you're being asked to do is not an unusual thing, and fast learning of tools you've never used before will become a regular occurrence. It's all about learning to leverage what you already know and fitting the new thing into the knowledge jigsaw in your head.

Use the resources that are available and you will be absolutely fine.>We learned about Bootstrap a week ago all during one 4 hour class. 

During that week after the class it would have been helpful had you applied what you learned on an object. Do you have a web server and a text editor ready? I don't know how helpful this will be but if you need to use Bootstrap and SASS to create a 12 page site then I would do something along the lines of:

* Decide on one idea you would want your 12 page site to be. A site about cars? Imagination!
* Get the SASS Bootstrap files and compile them as is initially. Load the CSS into a page. Make sure you have the whole compile and load part down because...
* ...since you cannot make something that resembles the ""go to"" Bootstrap look then edit some of the colours in the SASS file (make everything gray scale or all shades red or something) to change up some looks?
* Grab a few of the templates from the Bootstrap website and start modifying those by changing layout a bit and adding content.

Also, the grid system is easy once you understand columns go into rows and don't use one without the other. If you have a row you must use a column. If you want a column you must put it into a row.

    <div class=""row"">
      <div class=""col-md-6"">Left column</div>
      <div class=""col-md-6"">Right column</div>
    </div>I don't get what there is to learn about bootstrap, it's simply a css framework and if you go to their site like others you can click on components and see how to use them (aka what class/id to type in and bam there it is!) 

Sass takes getting used to but that has nice documentation as well. Just like css but with one more step to run in terminal (or you could just enable watch and it'll do it for you!)

My suggestion is build your 12 page site with bootstrap, then do it again but with another framework such as [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) or [Pure](http://purecss.io/) and then you'll get an understanding what frameworks are meant for. I jump around between frameworks because I do have a tendency of making my sites look really similar especially if I don't use a framework.I learnt all my web development knowledge by just getting up a template, getting stuck in and breaking things, then fixing it again!Thank you all for your time. I know that I just really need to read up and grasp it better. I'm just happy I had a place to come and ask a stupid question and get honest feedback. I'll use all of your tips and continue to work on it after the class. 

What other programs would you recommend me looking into as well? 

I've been using Sublime as my text editor, I also got Codekit with the start of Sass, Bootstrap we've used obviously, and Codecademy we've used too. I'd say, just start writing a unique new site in basic html. Then make it mobile. In the process of doing that, you'll have to implement bootstrap things. "
2016-04-25 04:15:49;Just learned about Bootstrap should I start with four?;"I would (and do) personally continue building with Bootstrap 3 until a stable version of 4 is officially released. Alpha comes before even a beta, so right now it's definitely not something I'd use for a project I intend to launch (or even bother with learning just yet, as changes are bound to happen).There is going to be a lot more documentation on 3, and until a final version of 4 is released I'm staying with 3.

I'm newer to coding. I do primarily print design so I took a class through Train Simple on using bootstrap in Dreamweaver to get my feet wet. Since then, I lean on the W3 schools site.I agree with the statements the other users have previously given.

Bootstrap 4 is not out of alpha yet.That means there can be huge breaking changes between the 'current' release (the alpha 2) and the next release (whenever that is).

So learn Bootstrap 3. Become comfortable with it. It still can and will help you immensely **today**. I'm also assuming that there will be enough similarities between versions 3 and 4 that once there is a stable release of 4 moving to it from 3 won't have a high learning curve to change components. You'll better understand the ""bootstrap way"" of things."
2016-04-24 02:11:18;How to import specific styles from bootstrap sass?;"You can selectively include Bootstrap components and include them the same way as is done in _bootstrap.scss.

It would be best to not edit _bootstrap.scss (as you should avoid editing packages), so you should probably replicate its functionality either in your base.scss file or create a new file, then don't import _bootstrap.scss.

For example, the top of your base.scss file could include something similar to this:

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss

... but you can comment out what you don't want (this is better as you can easily enable the features again), but you always need the variables and mixins, and you probably want the resets. You then just need to update the import paths appropriately.

A bit of general advice: you appear to be storing your custom CSS within the Bootstrap package. This isn't a good idea, and will cause you problems in the future. The following would be a better starting front-end structure:

* /bower_components (or whatever you want to use for packages)
  * /bootstrap-sass
  * /other-package
* /css (your compiled CSS)
* /js
* /scss (your custom Sass)
  * base.scss"

2016-05-04 22:33:16;Overriding CSS, Why is some of my CSS overriding and some isn't?;"It could be due to [selector specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity).

Take the following two selectors for a random bootstrappy thing;

    .row .col-md-6

    .col-md-6

The first one has a higher specificity that the second selector.  This is because it is more specific and is looking for any elements of class .col-md-6 within an element of class .row.

If you right-click and inspect-element in chrome you will see what selectors are matching the element and enforcing various properties.  Oftentimes, especially with bootstrap you will see a lot of things.  Whichever is listed in black text (greyed out selectors are comma separated selectors that don't apply to the element) is the selector matching the element.

To fix your issue I would inspect-element on whatever you're wanting to change (make sure you actually get the right element, navigating up/down the tree as necessary in the element tree) and see what selector is matching and applying the property/properties you are trying to override.  If you see it has something like "".dropdown-menu>.nav-list>.nav-link"" you'll have to be at least as specific as that selector to override it.

well apparently I can't even use reddit formatting properly...
Outside the answer longshot provided, I also highly recommend using a custom build of Bootstrap as a starting point. Take some time to really understand  the LESS variables and you will need fewer overrides. 

http://getbootstrap.com/customize/If you ever have a true issue and you really really need to override there's always important.

.col-xs-6{
    color: red!important;
}Ok I have an update on this... My CSS is only overwriting the mobile view, both the tablet media query and desktop query don't get overridden...

Bootstrap is only a grid system with some css and js components, and your trick is one as the million of ""tricks"" one can do with Bootstrap.

The modal div is displayed on top of that transparent div.

You can look at the source + css in a browser's inspector tools to learn all about it on Bootstrap's Modal example [page here](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals).Just set `overflow: hidden` on the body element."

Secondly, Bootstrap isn't really a template. It's a collection of premade CSS classes and components which you can use to develop a responsive website faster. If you don't understand how to use HTML and CSS though, it's not going to speed up anything.

You need to spend more time learning HTML & CSS. No-one here has the time to teach you the basics as if you're 5 when there are tons of free courses online that will do that. 

I recommend you do [this](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/make-a-website) course on Codecademy that will teach you the basics.[This will help summarize Bootstrap](https://www.taniarascia.com/what-is-bootstrap-and-how-do-i-use-it/).
[This will demystify WordPress](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/).captainfruitbag hit it on the nail. Bootstrap and WP are totally different. WP is a CMS, and think of Bootstrap as premade building blocks, Nav, Header and so on, but then you will want to customize the CSS to make it look the way you want it to.

After you get the basic of CSS I highly suggest learning Stylus for your CSS. For me I found it so natural to write CSS , totally love it. You should look into Train Simple, especially if you are using Dreamweaver. You can Google for a coupon code. I ended up getting a lifetime pass for like $80.

2016-07-18 19:15:52;Is it better practice to make use of utility classes or write my code directly in my CSS for that particular element?;"I guess it depends on whether the utility class will be reused or not. If it's a one-off, I don't see much point in adding a new class and modifying your HTML. Just extend the existing class and move on. 

If it's going to be reused, sure, make it a utility. If the *utility* class already exist then just add it as a class. Adding already existing code to each element just adds unnecessary file size and overhead. If its only needed once then yes, I would probably strip the class from the bootstrap css and embed it directly to the main style sheet.

No idea why you're posting in the bootstrap subbreddit though.If you implement one, sure. Otherwise, no.

Bootstrap is a CSS/JS framework: all the code runs in the web browser of the user visiting the site. That means that it doesn't have any way to access to the filesystem of the server that hosts your site, or any content-containing database on that server.

What you're looking for is a CMS. You mentioned ""wp-login"", which suggests that you've used WordPress before. You can use Bootstrap *with* WordPress - WordPress does the content management (remote editing of content, permissions, content delivery, image resizing, etc.), Bootstrap does the styling. That's absolutely fine. You can also use Bootstrap with basically any other CMS, too.

But there's nothing *in Bootstrap* that facilitates editing content on a remote server, no. That's not what Bootstrap is for."

So my guess is that your edge browser is smaller than 1200px wide with what you're looking at right now. 

In general I use col-sm sizes, so it keeps the column ratios until you get to the xs size, then all those go full width.


You can also stack the sizes class=""col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3"" then the div will go 1/4 width, 1/3 width, 1/2 width, full width as you shrink your browser size down. This is where the real power of the bootstrap responsive grid takes place."
2016-08-14 06:31:12;Using my own css...and dreamweaver;"Using Dreamweaver, the ultimate beginners mistake. Don't worry, we've all been there. Don't get me wrong, Dreamweaver does have a good code editor for HTML/CSS. However, you should avoid using the graphical editor within Dreamweaver and start learning HTML and CSS. In the end it will be faster to develop and gives you more control.

So about using Bootstrap, you load it's CSS file in the <head> and under that you load your own, custom css file. That's where you write your own styles and overwrite Bootstrap styles in case that is required. To know what CSS selectors you need, I advice you to use the build in developer tools in your web browser.

Let's say you want to change a buttons color:

1. Right click it in the browser → inspect element
1. Look where the color is coming from and copy its selector (might need to select another element)
1. Use that selector in your own CSS code to overwrite that color
1. Test again in the browserWith @De_Wouter, Dreamweaver isn't going to help in the long run and can even make things more confusing when the preview tells you different to the browser. 
Using the browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) element inspector is a great way to review & test CSS as you can live edit in the browser.

If you want a free editor Komodo Edit (http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/) is pretty nice although there's tonnes of alternatives. 
Also CodeKit (https://incident57.com/codekit/) is great for compiling LESS, Sass etc but its not free.

2016-08-31 17:14:01;Bootstrap 3 static footer on the bottom of page;"Divs by default have position:static. So you don't need a special class for this. Easiest way would be to assign height, background, etc to the footer element and nest in container / col classes as needed 

Position fixed is the property that sticks it on the screen, so don't use thatIf you mean a footer that sticks to the bottom of the body element and scrolls with it, here's how.

First, extend your html element to full height:

    html {
      position: relative;
      min-height: 100%;
    }

Now set the footer height and give it room at the bottom of the body element.

    body {
      margin-bottom: 200px;
    }
    footer {
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 180px; /* leaving a 20px gap */
    }

Inside the footer, you'll want to have some padding, and a container for the content.
    <div class=""container"">
      <footer> Footer </footer>
    </div>

    html, body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        height: 100%;
    }

    .container {
        position: relative;
        height: auto !important;
        height: 90%;
        min-height: 90%;
    }

    footer {
        position: absolute;

        bottom: 0;

2016-08-29 18:20:45;How to make a col-xs-6 100% of the other col-xs-6;"Add a class to both(same class) and in your CSS file, add a min-height. I'm not 100% certain because I haven't used it in a while, but you might look in to using CSS's Flex Box on those objects to guarantee their height is the same.  I think that's something it can handle.
This is a problem as old as CSS. Flexbox is one way to solve it, and probably the easiest to implement. [This site](http://flexboxin5.com) will get you started.You could place them in a wrapper div with that wrapper having a set height.

And inside you can set both classes of xs-6 with the height:100% in the css.

So 

   <div id= 'wrapper' style ='height:50vh'>

      <div class='col-xs-6' style='height:100%></div>
       <div class='col-xs-6' style='height:100%></div>


    </div>
I used a jquery function to do this. The issue was that the cols height changed depending on viewport.

How it worked:
Onload
- check height of left col and save is as variable
- det height of right column to variables height value

You might want to also have a check the rescale event just in case"

2016-09-05 00:04:15;Question about Bootstrap;"If I had to describe Bootstrap it would be its a CSS framework to help you follow best practices and avoid reinventing the wheel. It is open source and used on thousands of sites so it continues to get QA testing and that is extreme value you can pass on to your clients. Trying to figure out cross-browser quirks will leave you answering questions like ""how come this doesn't work on x or why does this look different in IE"" etc.

Here is the official documentation on what has changed and how to migrate from 3 to 4 http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/migration/. If you have a large site this will take some work because Its likely you are using some deprecated classes and markup.

The best way to use Bootstrap is to recompile the sass files into a custom build specific to your project. This lets you cut out what you don't need and make your site look unique to the default styles.

V4 isn't in a state that's ready for production sites yet I think. V3 is mature. There are enough differences that I wouldn't even consider a v3 to v4 upgrade path. Any of the v3 sites I made will probably stay as v3.

Bootstrap is used all the time, it's very popular.**What's the basic difference between v3 and v4 ?**

The basic difference between Bootstrap v3 and v4 is the grid system. Bootstrap v3 uses the **float** grid system which the alignment of columns matter a lot. Bootstrap v4 uses the **flexbox** grid system which aligning columns horizontally and vertically is easier. Search for flexbox for more information. However, Flexbox in v4 is not activated by default.

**Will I have problems if I try to use v3 over v4?**
No, you won't as well as you have known and learned CSS.

**How often is bootstrap used in web development particularly freelancing?**

I don't know and I don't care about it. Well, Bootstrap is a framework. Any framework can boost your work faster than you did previously (without framework).

The line "".delete(' ')"" was very important for titles, (sometimes names) containing spaces. They couldn't be converted to a variable with white space in them. So this gets rid of the white space to make the variables."
2016-09-14 14:18:24;Why does Bootstrap create color classes for each component ?;"The color palette of Bootstrap contains hard colors with white text (badges, progress bars, buttons, labels)

and soft colors with hard text color (panels, list group items, alerts)

Personally, I would combine the element with the color like this:

    .badge.danger, .progress-bar.danger, 
    .btn.danger, .label.danger {
        color: #fff;
        background-color: #ff0000;
    }


So to answer your question: I dont know.I like the principle of Bootstrap but scrutinising the CSS is painful. Way too much reiteration of styles and lack of combining standard layout/placement rules. 

The button/alert/progress-bar/label styling however makes sense as they are logical classes if you were to dynamically state the class from a server based on a compiled situation. What I wouldn't want to see is btn-blue, progress-bar-green etc. This is defined by cusomisation and theming. 

EDIT: they make way more sense when used in conjunction with style variables which would feed directly in to the overall colour scheme of these elements. What you have for immediate use is just a default colour style. You are totally welcome to fork bootstrap and make those changes to your own project, but it makes sense to me personally. It prevents a lot of custom classes necessary for tweaking components when you do need those differences. "

I can't just use the same lg class, it wouldn't work. That is why they're specific.

2016-10-05 18:27:43;Some questions from an experienced front-end dev well versed in html & css looking to make first bootstrap site;"If you've got a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then you should be good to go with Bootstrap. I've actually built a CMS using Bootstrap as the front-end framework - with a number of customizations.

[Here's a 3-image Imgur gallery as an example.](http://imgur.com/a/hAgjg) Sorry, site's in development  so I had to black out the client name.

First image is the dashboard with an open side navigation panel (which is something custom I built, based on Bootstrap's navigation bar).

Second image is a content list, using Bootstrap's tables and buttons.

Third image is a content editor form, using their form styling.You are over estimating what BS does - it won't help you build the features you've mentioned. It's a stylesheet and some JavaScript components - it can make a file upload look pretty, but won't make it actually do anything. You still need to build out the site, BS just makes it easier to make it look good. Just a tip, bootstrap gets old really really fast. We did some stuff with it back when it was still bootstrap 2. We did migrate some projects to BS3. Right now I'm in a state where I can't see it without getting annoyed. I can spot bootstrap sites from miles away and I'm becoming allergic to them. Everyone and their mother is using bootstrap for everything.

It doesn't help that bootstrap 4 (which in my opinion would help a lot) is in Alpha for more that a year now. 

Honestly, if you are looking for something to build on, there are many other frameworks out there. Things like bulma, uikit or materializecss. In my opinion they look much better than BS3."
2016-10-05 15:29:20;Multiple Panels and vertical spacing;"All the vertical space is caused by how the float model works. As each panel is its own .col-sm-6 block, the browser tries to position them the best it can while maintaining source order and float model rules.

What you could do is to only define two columns of .col-sm-6 and put half the panels in the left column and the rest to the right column. Source order will differ, but the gaps are gone.

2016-10-05 12:04:05;Is using Bootstrap form classes secured enough?;"This is out of scope for Bootstrap, you should always sanitize user inputs in the backend (php in your case). Look into parameterized queries. Always assume data coming from the frontend to be ""dirty"", you need to validate it server-side.No. *Nothing* in HTML/JS is secure against SQL injection, because it can *always* be edited on the client-side. To see this in effect, open your browser debugger (e.g. by right-clicking on the field and selecting Inspect Element, in many browsers) and change the type=""email"" to type=""text"". Tada: now the validation is disabled and you can inject away.

Furthermore, validating ""as an email"" wouldn't prevent SQL injection anyway, because characters like apostrophes and speech marks are valid in an email address.

*(Incidentally, type=""email"" is a HTML5 attribute; nothing to do with Bootstrap at all.)*

Never, never assume that anything coming from the client-side is safe for interpolation into an SQL statement. It doesn't matter whether it came from an email field or a numeric field or a <select> dropdown or even a hidden field - the user can *always* tamper with it. It doesn't matter if it's part of the URL or even the browser headers (e.g. user agent string or cookies: I discovered an XSS vulnerability in a cookie string recently). It doesn't matter... where it comes from: if it comes from the user's computer then it can't be trusted and must always, always be sanitised. The form of the sanitisation may vary depending on the expected type, but it must always be done.

You mentioned that you're using PHP. [Here's how you protect against SQL injection with PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.php#security.database.avoiding). In order of preference, you should consider:

1. Using prepared statements with bound variables. This is the single best way to protect against SQL injection attacks in PHP, and once you get into the habit of it you'll never look back.
2. Failing that, use *_real_escape_string() on any expected string variable before you interpolate it into your SQL statement. Consider using intval() on any expected integer variable, if it's appropriate for your use-case.

Shout if I can point you in the right kind of direction for any of this. Note that what you're asking about doesn't actually have anything to do with Bootstrap, though, and if you're looking for wider feedback you might like to post to /r/php or something.

**tl;dr: Never, never, never trust anything that comes from the user's computer: it can always be tampered with. Always, always, always escape before SQL interpolation, preferably by using prepared statements with bound variables.**No, not at all.

First, `type=""email""` as /u/doiveo suggests, isn't part of Bootstrap. It's part of the HTML5 specification, but it's up to the browser to handle validating that the text entered is in the form of an email address.

If I wanted to be malicious, I could use the Web Inspector in any browser to change the field to `type=""text""` or even change the `input` to a `textarea` and send any data I want to your form.

You need to sanitize, filter and validate any information that you get through forms on your server. How you do that depends on the server-side language you use.The same as others have said.

2016-10-29 14:28:23;How do i make an image responsive;"You can use the .img-responsive class but that only applies max-width: 100%, so it won't allow image to fill containers larger than their original size. In that case you should add your own class with

    width: 100%;
    height; auto;Try adding the class ""img-responsive"".  Alternatively you can do something like this:   
HTML:   
`<img src=""image.png"" class=""responsive-image"">`
CSS:  
`.responsive-image { width: 100%; height: auto; }`  
   
You can change the width percentage to whatever you want. The important thing to remember when making your site responsive is to always try and use percentages instead of fixed widths, especially with images. Another option is to use vw/vh. For example

HTML: <img class=""banana"" />
CSS: .banana {width: 50vw;}

This makes the image with the class ""banana"" half of the width of the screen. Just use .img-responsive class in your image. This is the bootstrap default class"

To keep it short, experiment. You need to experiment on it. Obviously you'll fail alot but that's how we all started ;)

Also you don't need to follow paid's themes look. Be creative and your theme will be there one day.Slightly off-topic, I would suggest to not use angular.

2016-11-22 15:00:51;"With bootstrap, can I render ""partial"" pages within a main page?";"Bootstrap is CSS. It has nothing to do with your project structure. You either import bootstrap into your project or you dont.

All that matters is that your import link is correct.

You can do this with PHP, Angular or any other Javascript framework. It doesnt matter. Because Botstrap is simply CSS.To add to what /u/Cyganek, if you really don't have a use for a backend interpreter and just want to do this with a static side, you can use SSI (server side includes) in your code to accomplish this. It's what I do when I need a zero-maintenance site and want to have easily managed sections of content.

[The way I use it in Nginx is like this.](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssi_module.html)

Create header.html and footer.html with your header and footer HTML, as well as any other presistent content like a sidebar. Anything that doesn't change include in the header and footer. The last tag in your header file should be your container div and the first tag in your footer should be closing that container div.

Then your content pages (index.html for example) will look like this:

    <!--# include file=""header.html"" -->
    
    PAGE CONTENT HERE
    
    <!--# include file=""footer.html"" -->

You can also do cool things with the SSI if command. Let's say you have a nav bar and you want the current page to be highlighted. In your content you set a variable with the page title using `<!--# set title=""home"" -->` then in your header.html you would use something like this in the navbar elements:

    <li><a href=""index.html"" class=""btn <!--# if title=""home"" -->active<!--# endif -->"">Home</a></li>

That just adds the ""active"" class to a button if the title variable matches. That's off the top of my head. There are probably some mistakes in there that need to be cleaned up but you can pretty well reproduce basic dynamic page features using SSI.

You could also use a static site generator. There are a lot of them to choose from. It basically gives you an interface to generate static pages easily for things like blogs that have new posts or updates regularly.You can do this with a static-site generator like Middleman or Jekyll, both of which are awesome!You could use Ruby on Rails partials for this."

2016-12-12 04:48:57;main.css and bootstrap;"First, welcome to CSS, you brave soul. :)

I'd strongly recommend doing some tutorials like the free ones on CodeSchool.com. Your style might be to ""dive in a figure it out"", but you're going to have a heck of a time trying to untangle all the little tricks and gotchas. This stuff is way more complicated than it ought to be. :/ Do yourself a favor and set aside a couple of hours to get the basics down pat.

But to try to answer your questions more directly, CSS properties are most commonly applied with classes, although they can also be applied with ids. Whereas selectors for classes are prepended with a period (as in "".col-md-2""), selectors for ids are prepended with a pound-sign (as in ""#one"").

Classes can invented on the fly (by you) and can be applied to virtually any element (for example, a right and left column of a page). When you apply styles, some of them ""cascade"" such as text color to all child elements, and other styles do not, such as width. You can generally use common sense to predict which styles cascade to the child elements.

When you're using a framework like Bootstrap, keep the documentation handy. If you browse the Bootstrap Grid docs (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) you'll see that columns must be wrapped in a ""row"" to work properly. Consult other examples to really understand how to use the system. Don't just muddle around; you'll regret it.

Good luck!In the easiest terms I can manage, you have two choices.  

**Choice 1**: Give your first col-md-2 a second class.  It can be called anything you want as long as you are consistent.   Then you end up with: 

HTML:

    <div class= ""col-md-2 highlightFirstColumn"">
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>

Notice that you can give an element multiple classes just by putting a space between them.  Your div is now both Bootstrap's col-md-2 and your own highlightFirstColumn (or any other name you give it).

CSS:

    div.highlightFirstColumn {
      /* Do something different */
    }

This CSS code says to look only for a div with the class highlightFirstColumn - and do something different.

**Choice 2: Pure CSS**

    div#one div.col-md-2:first-of-type {
      /* Do something different */
    }

Working from right to left:  `:first-of-type` should be obvious.  Apply this style to only the first element that matches what is touching the other side of the colon.  `div.col-md-2` means only apply to a <div> with the class col-md-2 applied.  Combined with the colon, you are only applying it to the first match.  `div#one` with a space between itself and the next div means *scan down the tree.*  Apply that only when everything else matches *inside of* <div id=""one"">. 

CSS uses periods to look for classes `.` and this thing of many names '#' to look for an ID.  

Best of luck!

I had to add CSS to constrain the form so that the popover had room to show. So that could be your issue, if the popover is getting clipped. Maybe examine the DOM and see if the HTML is getting injected and it's just a visibility issue.

Also double check that jQuery is actually loading. I know you said you had it but if it's not loading for some reason, errors would likely get swallowed.Check the developer console for errors, you might be requiring Jquery after the bootstrap CSS file. You need to require the jquery file before the CSS file. Otherwise the built in features like this don't usually work."
2016-12-09 23:07:32;Beginner question - problems with responsiveness of footer;"How are they being displayed and what is the column size?Ok I figured out some of it.

Its not stacking because you have no styles for mobile, by default it stacks everything at full width on mobile, you need to override it as xs. 

Then by using image responsive it should give you the space between the images.When using a navigation bar, you need to give the rest of the page room to account for that navigation bar.  The way I learned to do this is apply padding to the `body` CSS rules. 

In this case I'd suggest doing two things. 

**First**, find a way to add this into any sort of CSS. 

    body { 
      padding-bottom: 320px;
    }

**Second**: Constrain your bottom navigation area so that you know exactly how tall it will be.  Then change the 320px above to the new height plus fifteen.  So if you manage to make your bottom navigation always appear at 180 pixels tall, go ahead and change that padding-bottom number 195.   

(This is theoretical and personal on my end. Bootstrap pads things with 15px very frequently.  ""Add fifteen"" is a shortcut to make everything look consistent. ) 

My suggestions for the images are going to be more vague. It gets much easier if all of the images in a situation like that have the same dimensions.  The images right now are small enough that you could probably even stack them side by side using col-xs-6. 

Good luck!

*edited for pre-coffee formatting errors. Thanks to u/CPTAMaverick  and u/MrAndrewJ I've figured out how to make them stack properly and how to make sure the footer doesn't overlap with the entire page.

The only problem I have left now is the images align to the left when they get stacked on mobiel view like [this](http://imgur.com/tT48KBf). Anyone knows how to fix it?

2016-12-15 23:52:32;Issues with .row;"Without being able to see everything else, here are my thoughts. 

Make sure that your CSS is not setting sizes for any `#syrovy` `#viest` or `#gajda` 

Make sure your browser window is at least 992 pixels wide. 

Make sure your browser is not zooming in.  Press `Ctrl 0`  (zero) on a Windows keyboard, or find the ""Zoom"" feature in your menu.  Set it to 100%.  

Both of the above suggestions work on the same principal:  If your browser window is thinner than 992 pixels then your columns are *supposed to* stack one on top of another.   

On that note, make 100% sure that this line is between <head> and </head>.

    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1"">

That line allows your browser and Bootstrap work together to serve the right layout to the proper screen sizes.  If you're only using three, try using 4 instead of 1 in your column. The container has a max of 12. If you're only using three, give them a number that evenly adds them up. On Mobile but I am pretty sure you need to add the ""col"" class to those columns in addition to the sizing class.  

**Edit**: Skimming the docs looks like the above is not true.   

Try using the xs prefix instead of md and see if it has to do with the size of your viewport. Does this page exist anywhere on the web?  Can you fiddle it?  Or is this just local?remove the #generals id, does it work?Quick reply from my phone, but have you tried max-height and max-width? Also, for the Img tag, try a class of Img-responsive. "

If you don't define a col-xs size then it defaults to col-xs-12.  It's redundant to have that code, but you're not hurting anything with it.  Once the rest of your code is working, though, I encourage you to take out the col-xs-12 classes just to see it work the same way.  Wait until after you can see this working.

Do not nest containers.  It messes up formatting.  Once you have the main container then you can freely nest rows inside of columns.  The layout is taught as:

    Container -> Row -> Column

This is still 100% true *at the top level*.   Once the first container is present then your code should look like 

    Container -> Row -> Column -> Row -> Column -> Row -> Column -> Row -> Column -> Row -> Column

.... for as many levels as needed.  I know this after having made the same mistake when I started out too.

2017-02-22 20:01:41;Proper bootstrap theme development process?;"I'm a theme creator, so this is my area of expertise (Self plug: My [Bootstrap 4 themes](https://hackerthemes.com) and my [Bootstrap 2 and 3 themes](https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/HackerThemes)).

Depending on your requirements, you have two choices:

1. Build a custom version of Bootstrap and overwrite variables in [_custom.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_custom.scss)
2. Include the default Bootstrap CSS and overwrite Bootstrap styles in your own CSS

**Option 1** provides more power to quickly alter many aspects of Bootstrap by setting only a variable. For example, you can set $brand-success to a color of your choice, and now all those green ""success"" components have this new color. This would be more tedious with overwriting.
The drawback of this option is that you have to build Bootstrap, which adds to your build process. It also means that to update Bootstrap later, you'll have to rebuild from source. This can be mitigated by a good build process (for example with gulp or grunt). You also won't be able to use an existing CDN to include Bootstrap on your site. You can overwrite the variables from [_variables.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss).

**Option 2** is simpler to get started with. It's easier to update Bootstrap down the line and you can [use it from CDN](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/#bootstrap-cdn) which improves performance. I think it's safe to say that this is the path chosen by 95%+ of the Bootstrap websites out there. You simply add standard Bootstrap and then add a custom CSS file where you overwrite styles as necessary, and of course add styles for your own components that you'll add to the site/theme. This is more suitable if you're mostly happy with how components look or using Bootstrap only for the grid and CSS reset/reboot.

The ""seperate Bootstrap theme file"" that you mention in Bootstrap 3 was simply a skin that made Bootstrap components look skeuomorph instead of flat. Bootstrap changed from skeuomorph to flat with version 3, so that was done for people who preferred the old style.

Be aware that Bootstrap 4 is still alpha and may introduce breaking changes still. I decided to build my newest theme ""Charming"" with BS 4 and I've been bitten a little bit by this. Class names may change and break stuff when you update.

Hope this helps."

I think a potential problem is if you need to add more styles over time, it can be easy to just keep adding utility classes, or end up with a component styled partially in css and partially with utility classes. 

If you truly just need to add a bit of margin or padding to an element I don't see the harm in your approach, but I personally found once I started using utility classes this way I quickly began overusing them. I generally just try to keep everything in css now.CSS is better but not the way you're doing it. List the classes you want to apply the certain padding to, separated by a comma. Or, make use of extends with SASS. This should not go in the HTML.If you find yourself doing this often you or your designer should read up on grid design. You might as well be using inline styles for this.ezspaceCSS has this and it's perfect for bootstrap 3 projects. It provides a set of pre-calculated margin and padding helper classes.

2017-04-11 14:40:46;Is Bootstrap 4 production-ready with first beta around the corner?;"How is something production ready if it's in beta?     It seems odd to me that almost all the responses here simply say if a product has a beta tag it can't be used in prod.  Beta can mean many things.  Gmail was still in beta when it had a hundred million users.

In my view, beta in this case means the design and interface has stabilised to the point where there are unlikely to be major/breaking changes, and the devs feel comfortable moving from an alpha (things might change) to a beta (things have pretty much settled).  We've been using B4 since the early alphas, and it's already very good: much more stable than many production products.  But with a large user base, the devs are rightly cautious.

So I'd encourage the community to live a little more dangerously and move to B4 sooner.  I know everyone is nice and comfortable with B3, but B3 isn't going to change any more, and sticking with it is also a choice (that means you'll gradually be left behind).It is production-ready when it has received and subsequently shed the beta label. That's what the beta label means.NoHolds up well in practice for me. I have been using it in several sites that went live in the past month. Alpha 6 was a large step from Alpha 5 and cleared up a lot of issues. Is it perfect? No. For the imperfections, we either created some work around classes, or scripts, or we just didn't utilize some of those design features. It still allowed us to create a great site that works for the majority of modern browsers at a much faster rate.

IMO - A design framework isn't the same as a backend framework in terms of stability. I would probably never use a Laravel PHP framework version in alpha (or beta), for security reasons. Most of our client sites don't need to be regularly updated for the design framework and we usually just work with whatever version we are currently using, regardless of dev status.> production-ready

-
> beta

wat?Yeah it's beta but how does it hold up in practice? I believe Bootstrap 4 has been in alpha for a very long time. One of the issues of very long alpha or a beta stamped releases is they eventually become the de facto release. Been there before with another open source project that had too long of a beta cycle. I came from future). And now a month later Bootstrap 4 Beta is still 92% complete.  So things are going pretty well I think. And I'm not sure but may be this year we will see beta/I view beta tags as ""use at your own risk.""

You can certainly use it. But you may expect more issues than something more developed. So you should test the hell out of it on as many browsers as you can before releasing. 

Also, as new versions are released and you update, expect to make plenty of modifications to your UI with each release.Short answer: No.

Long answer: Noooooooooo.

Seriously though. A beta quality release of anything never means it is production ready. Things can still break between beta releases but, compared to alpha quality releases, BC breaks in the beta stage should be minimal.

So developers should continue to use something else.Just use Foundation if you want a modern CSS framework. "

Technology doesn’t matter (PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Java, …) as long as it works. Most technologies have ways to connect with most types of (common) database systems. Depending on the technology you use there are plenty of frameworks that could make it easier for your to build a RESTful API.

2. Build a front-end, a single page application (SPA) would be best practice for that. Plenty of good frameworks that could help you with that (Vue.js, React, Angular, …). It might also be done without a framework (just plain JS) but that might turn out in a lot more work in the end.

3. Use Bootstrap (with your admin theme) to style your front-end.

4. In your front-end JavaScript, connect with your API using AJAX requests (or Websockets but this will be overkill for you). You can do it in plain JavaScript, but since you are using Bootstrap which depends on jQuery you might use jQuery for your AJAX request, it’s a bit simpler. Or any other external library designed for it (there are plenty).

    .carousel-inner > .item > img, .carousel-inner > .item > a > img { display: block; height: auto; line-height: 1; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%; }

Specifically it is the 'margin: 0 auto' which centers the image in the carousel, then 'max-width:100%' allows it to fill the div completely. Sorry for the bad formatting, im on mobile. Hope this helps!

2017-06-14 22:54:01;Bootstrap 4's Reboot file uses sane modern techniques, but it is dependent on a number of other Bootstrap files. I've created a Gist with all the variables/mixins it requires so you can drop it into any non-Bootstrap site.;"I really enjoy Bootstrap 4's [Reboot](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/content/reboot/) settings. You can read about some of the plusses [here](https://medium.com/css-mine/bootstraps-reboot-next-evolutionary-step-for-css-reset-a30f718521b9), but that article skips over my favorite feature - [system-native fonts](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/). 

I wanted to use Bootstrap's Reboot on a site of mine without using the rest of Bootstrap. I created the file in this Gist and added it to my main Sass stylesheet. First, you `@import ""reboot-variables""` and then `@import ""../../bower_components/bootstrap/scss/reboot""` (of course, reflect this to wherever you have Bootstrap 4 in your project).

You may also want to add [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) before this. Bootstrap 4 [currently does this](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/bootstrap.scss), but I'm not sure if that will be the case in the future. 

Sidenote: If you don't want all these variables and just want to drop Bootstrap's Reboot into your site as-is, you can grab it from https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev/dist/css instead. I prefer having these variables so I can re-use them on other parts of my stylesheet. "

Scroll down the page. Look at the ""What's Included"" and ""Basic Template"" for the information you need.There are going to be i believe 3 total filea or cdns that will be required. I believe using the cdn files would be easiest to start.

1. Bootstrap css cdn
2. Bootstrap javascript cdn
3. Jquery cdn

Once those are in your html doc, you should be able to use bootstrap on any part of your html. You would need to be on a web enabled computer, if thats not possible, you will need to download all the files.You can use a CDN (a server dedicated to delivering files) to link to the bootstrap files or you can host it yourself. As mentioned by another user here there's a getting started page to see how to set it up.

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrapYou can view active progress towards the beta release here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/milestone/41

I wouldn't let the slow development keep you from using bs4.Just looking at the commit log, there were 32 commits just *today*.  So it's very much a live project.

As for the beta label, my guess is with a large user base, they want to make sure they really get it right and not have to introduce breaking changes post-alpha.From what I can tell, BS4 is a big rewrite. Dropping less for sass, full support for flex in the grid, and a whole host of other stuff. Given that I have to support legacy projects built in BS2 and new sites built in BS3, and then to add BS4 into the mix, I think I'll be happy for them to release it when it's good and ready. I'd say it's pretty much dead. There's not much demand for it anymore. Even 2 years ago, there wasn't a big call to rewrite Bootstrap 3.

For example, I'd assume for desktops/large screens, you want the input to be fluid-width, occupying all of the horizontal space between with the fixed-width logotype at left and the fixed-width submit button at right. On smaller devices, the logotype should remain left-aligned on one row, and the input and fixed-width submit button should wrap to a second row. Is any of that right? If so, flexbox all the way."

""If you want a timeline, we're looking at closer to 2 weeks than September, but as always, I can't provide any guarantees.""

That was about 2 weeks ago. I'm under the impression that there are a fair amount of cleanup things left to do and that the contributors have limited capacity right now so they'll need a bit of time.

As for using it in Angular 2, assuming you're using the CLI, just download the latest alpha via npm, change ""app.css"" to ""app.scss"" (if you're not using Sass already), and then `@import` the desired Bootstrap scss file from within ""app.scss"".

For components, ng-bootstrap seems to have good BS4 support. I haven't checked on ngx-bootstrap lately but I believe that one might too.No idea at this point. It's taken far far to long now. Obviously no bad feeling towards its creators, they're making it out of passion. But from a business point of view, it's made the whole bootstrap project look like it's on very shakey grounds for the future. I say this as someone who uses it every day and loves it to pieces.

We're at just under 3 years since Bootstrap 4 was announced. In comparison it took 17 months to go from Bootstrap 2's first release to Bootstrap 3's first stable release. We're at 47 months now and still not close to a stable release.

They really need to look at getting more core contributors on board. I get that this is mdo's baby and he's very protective of it. But seriously there's something very wrong when he has to spend an evening randomly closing issues and instantly halting all BS3 development to try and push BS4 out.

2017-08-07 00:06:29;How do I completely customize the bootstrap navbar?;"Okay - I'm awake and on a computer. I just took a look while waiting on a call and this worked in Chrome. 

Somewhere in your assets/main.css file edit your .navbar-default area (line 4?) so that background color looks more like this: 

    .navbar-default {
      background-color: #1c1d21;
      background-color: rgba(28,29,33,0);
      /* other navbar stuff stays */
    }

You'll still want to test in other browsers.   The 28,29,33,0 should match your 1c1d21 color.

Put the rgba version *under* the first background color for full compatibility.  In theory: Browsers that can't show the transparent color should fall back to the current color.  Browsers that can show the transparent color will overwrite the solid color.  Just put the new background-color line *under* your old one instead of replacing it. 

Again, the relevant line is:  `background-color: rgba(28,29,33,0);`

*edited a few times for clarity and compatibility concerns.*I'm on mobile at the moment but perhaps(?) in your css:

    background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);To make it transparent just change the css background to none or something of the sort. Have a look at _variables.scss(v4) or variables.less(v3). There is a whole section on navs you can customize to your heart's content. Open chrome dev tools via F12. After that click on navbar , if all will be right you will see navbar CSS properties. Create separate custom CSS file and override same property. If it will not work . Try to put !Important in end of CSS property , which you want to change . But before use !Important read about it."
