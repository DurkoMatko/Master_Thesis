I found Twitter data very suitable for sentiment analysis and therefore decided to analyze only tweets and use SO and Reddit later in Chapter \ref{chap:pairingBugs}  about recognizing bugs in discussions.

Using the steps described in Section \ref{ssec:GettingData}, I have downloaded tweets with following time conditions/patterns:
\begin{itemize}
\item days prior and after release
\item weekly
\end{itemize}
