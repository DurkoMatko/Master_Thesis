I found Twitter data very suitable for sentiment analysis and therefore decided to analyze only tweets and use SO and Reddit later in chapter \ref{chap:pairingBugs}  about recognizing bugs in discussions.

Using the steps described in section \ref{ssec:GettingData}, I've downloaded tweets with following time conditions/patterns:
\begin{itemize}
\item between two immediate releases
\item on release dates
\item weekly
\end{itemize}
