There are many ways and approaches how to find out whether 2 texts are similar or not. Most of them are to some extent very similar as the general need says some textual features of need to be extracted and compared.

I've tried following algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nouns extraction
\item String similarity using NLTK
\item String similarity using Gensim
\item The textual properties, title and description
are concatenated together and then used to numeric features using the simple TakeLab system. This approach was shown by Lazar, Ritchey and Sharif. \cite{lazar2014improving}
\end{enumerate}
