One more considered approach how to recognize an issue's topic was using the GIT labels. 

These default labels come as a big help in directing the project and targeting the most important issues, but they don't say much about the nature of the issue itself.

The custom tags tell are used to specify the part of the project, where the issue is located but they still don't give any semantic information about the issue itself. That's the reason why this approach was rejected.
