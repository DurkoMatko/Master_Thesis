One more considered approach how to recognize an issue's topic was using the GIT labels. \\
These default labels come as a big help in directing the project and targeting the most important issues, but they do not say much about the nature of the issue itself.\\
The custom tags tell are used to specify the part of the project, where the issue is located but they still do not give any semantic information about the issue itself. That is the reason why this approach was rejected.
