From the very beginning, I knew I wanted to use Python. I had some slight background knowledge in ML from online courses and most of them were done in Python. Therefore while searching and deciding which library should I use, I've always given a slight edge to the Python options. I've considered (and tested) these:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{NLTK} - probably the best-known Python module for NLP. It provides easy-to-use interfaces for more than 50 corpora and lexical resources. It also offeres a rich palette of processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.
\item \textbf{Textblob: Simplified Text Processing} - as a name says, Textblob provides easy processing and is actually built on top of NLTK. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree), classification, translation and more.
\item \textbf{Scikit-learn} - Python module for general ML, data mining and data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib modules.
\end{itemize}
