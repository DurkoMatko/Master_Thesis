First and the most simple analysis was to compare sentiment of tweets collected 3 days prior and post-release. Results are shown in table \ref{table:BeforeAfterReleaseSentiment}.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|}
 \hline
\textbf{Project }& \textbf{Before}& \textbf{After}\\
 \hline
 NodeJS   & 0.707 & 0.709\\ \hline
 EmberJS   & 0.719 & 0.719\\ \hline
 VueJS   & 0.694 & 0.708\\ \hline 
 Symfony & 0.73 & 0.729\\ \hline   
 AngularJS   & 0.718 & 0.719\\ \hline
 CakePhp & 0.71 & 0.702\\ \hline 
 Bower   & 0.634 & 0.638\\ \hline 
 Laravel & 0.683 & 0.696\\ \hline
 Gulp & 0.608 & 0.573\\ \hline
 Yii & 0.643 & 0.606\\ \hline
 Bootstrap & 0.713 & 0.693\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Average sentiment of tweets 3 days before and after releases}
\label{table:BeforeAfterReleaseSentiment}
\end{table}

From the data shown in table is visible, that there is no big sentiment shift caused by releases on the small time frame. The biggest noticable pattern is 5\% decrease in sentiment of two of three seldom releasing projects. Also the third one (Bootstrap) showed the decrease in sentiment as well. Next step was to do the analysis on the bigger scale and see if sentiment changes with the amount of releases/commits per month.
