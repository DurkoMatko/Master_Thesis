There are loads of OSS projects nowadays and it turned out to be pretty interesting process to choose the correct ones for my project. To make sure chosen projects fit into my work and fit  all my needs I defined several requirements which needed to be fulfilled at least to some extent:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Project needs to be widely used and well-known. This ensures there will be enough data on social media about it what will result in the less biased final results.
  \item Project has to have accessible bug tracking system or Git repository with list of known issues. This will provide the data for pairing the social media data with their corresponding bug items.
  \item Ideally, projects could be from the same area to avoid coincidentally choosing an outlier project from some either popular or unpopular field.
\end{itemize}

After considering these three points, I ended up choosing several open source web development frameworks as my projects of interest. Project of my choice are NodeJS, AngularJS, EmberJS, VueJS for frontend technologies and Laravel, Symfony and CakePhp for backend PHP technologies. Some frameworks like Django, Meteor, React have been left out because of their misleading names  would require lot of additional work to filter out data unrelated to the actual frameworks. For example, when tested Django framework, most of the twitter data referred to movie "Django Unchained".

Other very interesting group of OSS project to examine are cryptocurrencies. Being a very hot topic these days, I've decided to work with some of the most popular cryptocurrency repositories as well. These were Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and Ripple.
